42001049  because the mighty one has done great things for me. Holy is his name. 
42001073  the solemn pledge he made to our ancestor Abraham. He has granted
42001075  in holiness and righteousness in God’s eyes, for as long as we live. 
43001013  born not from blood nor from human desire or passion, but born from God. 
44002027  because you won’t abandon me to the grave, nor permit your holy one to experience decay. 
44015017  so that the rest of humanity will seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles who belong to me. The Lord says this, the one who does these things
45002020  an educator of the foolish; a teacher of infants (since you have the full content of knowledge and truth in the Law); 
45003016  destruction and misery are in their ways;
45003017  and they don’t know the way of peace.
45009028  because the Lord does what he says completely and quickly.
46015055  Where is your victory, Death? Where is your sting, Death?
50002008  he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. 
50002011  and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. 
51001020  and he reconciled all things to himself through him— whether things on earth or in the heavens. He brought peace through the blood of his cross. 
55002012  If we endure, we will also rule together. If we deny him, he will also deny us. 
58001012  You will fold them up like a coat. They will be changed like a person changes clothes, but you stay the same, and the years of your life won’t come to an end.
58002008  You put everything under their control. When he puts everything under their control, he doesn’t leave anything out of control. But right now, we don’t see everything under their control yet.
58008012  because I will be lenient toward their unjust actions, and I won’t remember their sins anymore.
60001025  but the Lord’s word endures forever. This is the word that was proclaimed to you as good news. 
66011018  The nations were enraged, but your wrath came. The time came for the dead to be judged. The time came to reward your servants, the prophets and saints, and those who fear your name, both small and great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth."
