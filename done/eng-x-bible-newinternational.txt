40001002	Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,
40001003	Judah the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram,
40001004	Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,
40001005	Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse,
40001006	and Jesse the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah’s wife,
40001007	Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,
40001008	Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Jehoram, Jehoram the father of Uzziah,
40001009	Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,
40001010	Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah,
40001011	and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.
40001012	After the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,
40001013	Zerubbabel the father of Abihud, Abihud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor,
40001014	Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Akim, Akim the father of Elihud,
40001015	Elihud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob,
40001016	and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, and Mary was the mother of Jesus who is called the Messiah.
40006014	For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
40006015	But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.
40011011	Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
40011012	From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people have been raiding it.
40011013	For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
40011014	And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.
40011015	Whoever has ears, let them hear.
40011018	For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, “He has a demon.”
40011019	The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, “Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.” But wisdom is proved right by her deeds.’
40013013	This is why I speak to them in parables: ‘Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand.
40013014	In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: ‘ “You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.
40013016	But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
40013017	For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.
40022045	If then David calls him “Lord”, how can he be his son?’
40022046	No-one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no-one dared to ask him any more questions.
40026032	But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.’
41001004	And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
41001005	The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptised by him in the River Jordan.
41001006	John wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt round his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
41001007	And this was his message: ‘After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.
41001008	I baptise you with water, but he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit.’
41007008	You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions.’
41009049	Everyone will be salted with fire.
41012036	David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: ‘ “The Lord said to my Lord: ‘Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.’ ”
41012037	David himself calls him “Lord”. How then can he be his son?’ The large crowd listened to him with delight.
41014028	But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.’
42001046	And Mary said: ‘My soul glorifies the Lord
42001047	and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour,
42001048	for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed,
42001049	for the Mighty One has done great things for me – holy is his name.
42001050	His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.
42001051	He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.
42001052	He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.
42001053	He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.
42001054	He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful
42001055	to Abraham and his descendants for ever, just as he promised our ancestors.’
42001068	‘Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come to his people and redeemed them.
42001069	He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David
42001070	(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),
42001071	salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us –
42001072	to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant,
42001073	the oath he swore to our father Abraham:
42001074	to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear
42001075	in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
42001076	And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,
42001077	to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,
42001078	because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven
42001079	to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace.’
42002029	‘Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace.
42002030	For my eyes have seen your salvation,
42002031	which you have prepared in the sight of all nations:
42002032	a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel.’
42003023	Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of Heli,
42003024	the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melki, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,
42003025	the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,
42003026	the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josek, the son of Joda,
42003027	the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,
42003028	the son of Melki, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,
42003029	the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,
42003030	the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,
42003031	the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
42003032	the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,
42003033	the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,
42003034	the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,
42003035	the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,
42003036	the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
42003037	the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Kenan,
42003038	the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
42007033	For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, “He has a demon.”
42007034	The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, “Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.”
42007035	But wisdom is proved right by all her children.’
42020018	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.’
42020044	David calls him “Lord.” How then can he be his son?’
42023031	For if people do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?’
43012014	Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written:
43012041	Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him.
44001020	‘For,’ said Peter, ‘it is written in the Book of Psalms: ‘ “May his place be deserted; let there be no-one to dwell in it,” and, ‘ “May another take his place of leadership.”
44001021	Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus was living among us,
44001022	beginning from John’s baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection.’
44004012	Salvation is found in no-one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.’
44004027	Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed.
44004028	They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen.
44004029	Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness.
44004030	Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.’
44013033	he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm: ‘ “You are my son; today I have become your father.”
44013034	God raised him from the dead so that he will never be subject to decay. As God has said, ‘ “I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.”
44013035	So it is also stated elsewhere: ‘ “You will not let your holy one see decay.”
44015023	With them they sent the following letter: The apostles and elders, your brothers, To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings.
44015024	We have heard that some went out from us without our authorisation and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said.
44015025	So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul –
44015026	men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
44015027	Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing.
44015028	It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements:
44015029	You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell.
44023026	Claudius Lysias, To His Excellency, Governor Felix: Greetings.
44023027	This man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, but I came with my troops and rescued him, for I had learned that he is a Roman citizen.
44023028	I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him to their Sanhedrin.
44023029	I found that the accusation had to do with questions about their law, but there was no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment.
44023030	When I was informed of a plot to be carried out against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also ordered his accusers to present to you their case against him.
45008037	No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
45008038	For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
45008039	neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45009016	It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.
45009017	For Scripture says to Pharaoh: ‘I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.’
45009018	Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.
45009025	As he says in Hosea: ‘I will call them “my people” who are not my people; and I will call her “my loved one” who is not my loved one,’
45009026	and, ‘In the very place where it was said to them, “You are not my people,” there they will be called “children of the living God.” ’
45009027	Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: ‘Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved.
45009028	For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality.’
45009029	It is just as Isaiah said previously: ‘Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.’
45010018	But I ask: did they not hear? Of course they did: ‘Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.’
45010019	Again I ask: did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, ‘I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding.’
45010020	And Isaiah boldly says, ‘I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.’
45010021	But concerning Israel he says, ‘All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.’
45011008	as it is written: ‘God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear, to this very day.’
45011009	And David says: ‘May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling-block and a retribution for them.
45012021	Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
45014012	So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.
45015009	and, moreover, that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written: ‘Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles; I will sing the praises of your name.’
45015010	Again, it says, ‘Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.’
45015011	And again, ‘Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; let all the peoples extol him.’
45015012	And again, Isaiah says, ‘The Root of Jesse will spring up, one who will arise to rule over the nations; in him the Gentiles will hope.’
45015022	This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.
46002009	However, as it is written: ‘What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what no human mind has conceived’ – the things God has prepared for those who love him –
46002010	these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
46002016	for, ‘Who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?’ But we have the mind of Christ.
46015033	Do not be misled: ‘Bad company corrupts good character.’
46015034	Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God – I say this to your shame.
46015056	The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
46015057	But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
47006016	What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: ‘I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.’
47006017	Therefore, ‘Come out from them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you.’
47006018	And, ‘I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.’
47009010	Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.
47009011	You will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.
49004009	(What does ‘he ascended’ mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions?
49004010	He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.)
49004011	So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers,
49004012	to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up
49004013	until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
58001005	For to which of the angels did God ever say, ‘You are my Son; today I have become your Father’? Or again, ‘I will be his Father, and he will be my Son’?
58001006	And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, ‘Let all God’s angels worship him.’
58001007	In speaking of the angels he says, ‘He makes his angels spirits, and his servants flames of fire.’
58001008	But about the Son he says, ‘Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; a sceptre of justice will be the sceptre of your kingdom.
58001009	You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.’
58001010	He also says, ‘In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
58001012	You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But you remain the same, and your years will never end.’
58001013	To which of the angels did God ever say, ‘Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet’?
58001014	Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?
58002008	and put everything under their feet.’, In putting everything under them, God left nothing that is not subject to them. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to them.
58002009	But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now crowned with glory and honour because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.
58002012	He says, ‘I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters; in the assembly I will sing your praises.’
58002013	And again, ‘I will put my trust in him.’ And again he says, ‘Here am I, and the children God has given me.’
58004003	Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, ‘So I declared on oath in my anger, “They shall never enter my rest.” ’ And yet his works have been finished since the creation of the world.
58004004	For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: ‘On the seventh day God rested from all his works.’
58004005	And again in the passage above he says, ‘They shall never enter my rest.’
58004008	For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.
58004009	There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God;
58004010	for anyone who enters God’s rest also rests from their works, just as God did from his.
58004011	Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no-one will perish by following their example of disobedience.
58005005	In the same way, Christ did not take on himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him, ‘You are my Son; today I have become your Father.’
58005006	And he says in another place, ‘You are a priest for ever, in the order of Melchizedek.’
58007022	Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.
58010008	First he said, ‘Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them’ – though they were offered in accordance with the law.
58010009	Then he said, ‘Here I am, I have come to do your will.’ He sets aside the first to establish the second.
58010010	And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
58010016	‘This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds.’
58010017	Then he adds: ‘Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.’
58010037	For, ‘In just a little while, he who is coming will come and will not delay.’
58010038	And, ‘But my righteous one will live by faith. And I take no pleasure in the one who shrinks back.’
58010039	But we do not belong to those who shrink back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved.
58013005	Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.’
58013006	So we say with confidence, ‘The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?’
60002006	For in Scripture it says: ‘See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.’
60002007	Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,’
60002008	and, ‘A stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.’ They stumble because they disobey the message – which is also what they were destined for.
60002023	When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.
60002024	‘He himself bore our sins’ in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; ‘by his wounds you have been healed.’
60002025	For ‘you were like sheep going astray,’ but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
60005006	Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time.
60005007	Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.
66002001	‘To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands.
66002002	I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false.
66002003	You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary.
66002004	Yet I hold this against you: you have forsaken the love you had at first.
66002005	Consider how far you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.
66002006	But you have this in your favour: you hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
66002007	Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.
66002008	‘To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again.
66002009	I know your afflictions and your poverty – yet you are rich! I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
66002010	Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor’s crown.
66002011	Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who is victorious will not be hurt at all by the second death.
66002012	‘To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words of him who has the sharp, double-edged sword.
66002013	I know where you live – where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to my name. You did not renounce your faith in me, not even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your city – where Satan lives.
66002014	Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: there are some among you who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin so that they ate food sacrificed to idols and committed sexual immorality.
66002015	Likewise, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
66002016	Repent therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
66002017	Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give that person a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to the one who receives it.
66002018	‘To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze.
66002019	I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that you are now doing more than you did at first.
66002020	Nevertheless, I have this against you: you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols.
66002021	I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling.
66002022	So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways.
66002023	I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.
66002024	Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan’s so-called deep secrets, “I will not impose any other burden on you,
66002025	except to hold on to what you have until I come.”
66002026	To the one who is victorious and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations –
66002027	that one “will rule them with an iron sceptre and will dash them to pieces like pottery” – just as I have received authority from my Father.
66002028	I will also give that one the morning star.
66002029	Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
66003001	‘To the angel of the church in Sardis write: These are the words of him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your deeds; you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.
66003002	Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have found your deeds unfinished in the sight of my God.
66003003	Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; hold it fast, and repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what time I will come to you.
66003004	Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy.
66003005	The one who is victorious will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out the name of that person from the book of life, but will acknowledge that name before my Father and his angels.
66003006	Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
66003007	‘To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What he opens no-one can shut, and what he shuts no-one can open.
66003008	I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no-one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.
66003009	I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars – I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.
66003010	Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth.
66003011	I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no-one will take your crown.
66003012	The one who is victorious I will make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will they leave it. I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on them my new name.
66003013	Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
66003014	‘To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God’s creation.
66003015	I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other!
66003016	So, because you are lukewarm – neither hot nor cold – I am about to spit you out of my mouth.
66003017	You say, “I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.” But you do not realise that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.
66003018	I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so that you can become rich; and white clothes to wear, so that you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so that you can see.
66003019	Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent.
66003020	Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.
66003021	To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne.
66003022	Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’
66004009	Whenever the living creatures give glory, honour and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever,
66004010	the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say:
66005013	Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, saying: ‘To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honour and glory and power, for ever and ever!’
66005014	The four living creatures said, ‘Amen’, and the elders fell down and worshipped.
66007005	From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben 12,000, from the tribe of Gad 12,000,
66007006	from the tribe of Asher 12,000, from the tribe of Naphtali 12,000, from the tribe of Manasseh 12,000,
66007007	from the tribe of Simeon 12,000, from the tribe of Levi 12,000, from the tribe of Issachar 12,000,
66007008	from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000, from the tribe of Joseph 12,000, from the tribe of Benjamin 12,000.
66007010	And they cried out in a loud voice: ‘Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.’
66007011	All the angels were standing round the throne and round the elders and the four living creatures. They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshipped God,
66007012	saying: ‘Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honour and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!’
66011015	The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said: ‘The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah, and he will reign for ever and ever.’
66011016	And the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshipped God,
66011017	saying: ‘We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign.
66016006	for they have shed the blood of your holy people and your prophets, and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve.’
66016007	And I heard the altar respond: ‘Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and just are your judgments.’
66016015	‘Look, I come like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake and remains clothed, so as not to go naked and be shamefully exposed.’
66016016	Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.
66017005	The name written on her forehead was a mystery: babylon the great the mother of prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth.
66017006	I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God’s holy people, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly astonished.
