40003004	Johnʼs clothes were made of camelʼs hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
40004006	“If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down. For it is written: “ ‘He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’”
40004007	Jesus answered him, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”
40008017	This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: “He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases.”
40008018	When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake.
40008019	Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
40008020	Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”
40010035	For I have come to turn “ ‘a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law —
40010036	a manʼs enemies will be the members of his own household.’
40011010	This is the one about whom it is written: “ ‘I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’
40011011	Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
40013013	This is why I speak to them in parables: “Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand.
40013014	In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: “ ‘You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.
40013035	So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: “I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.”
40013036	Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”
40013037	He answered, “The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.
40021009	The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!” “Hosanna in the highest heaven!”
40021010	When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, “Who is this?”
40026031	Then Jesus told them, “This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: “ ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’
40026032	But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”
41001002	as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way”  — 
41001003	“a voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’ ”
41004012	so that, “ ‘they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!’”
41004013	Then Jesus said to them, “Donʼt you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?
41011009	Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, “Hosanna!” “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”
41011010	“Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!” “Hosanna in the highest heaven!”
41012010	Havenʼt you read this passage of Scripture: “ ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;
41012011	the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”
41012036	David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: “ ‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.” ’
41012037	David himself calls him ‘Lord.’ How then can he be his son?” The large crowd listened to him with delight.
41014027	“You will all fall away,” Jesus told them, “for it is written: “ ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’
41014028	But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”
43012013	They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, “Hosanna!” “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!” “Blessed is the king of Israel!”
43012014	Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, as it is written:
43012015	“Do not be afraid, Daughter Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkeyʼs colt.”
43012038	This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: “Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”
43012039	For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere:
43012040	“He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn — and I would heal them.”
45003004	Not at all! Let God be true, and every human being a liar. As it is written: “So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge.”
45003005	But if our unrighteousness brings out Godʼs righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.)
45003010	As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one;
45003011	there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God.
