40006015	But if you don’t forgive others, then your Father in heaven will not forgive the wrongs you do.
40009005	The Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins. But how can I prove this to you?

Then you will be able to see if I really have this power or not.” So Jesus said to the paralyzed man,

But the fact is, Elijah was sent to none of those widows in Israel. He was sent only to a widow in Zarephath, a town in Sidon.
42004026	
42005008	The fishermen were all amazed at the many fish they caught. When Simon Peter saw this, he bowed down before Jesus and said, “Go away from me, Lord. I am a sinful man!”
42005009	
42005023	The Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins. But how can I prove this to you? Maybe you are thinking it was easy for me to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven.’ There’s no proof that it really happened. But what if I say to the man, ‘Stand up and walk’? Then you will be able to see that I really have this power.” So Jesus said to the paralyzed man, “I tell you, stand up! Take your mat and go home!”

42007035	But wisdom is shown to be right by those who accept it.”
42008028	The demon inside the man had often seized him, and he had been put in jail with his hands and feet in chains. But he would always break the chains. The demon inside him would force him to go out to the places where no one lived. Jesus commanded the evil spirit to come out of the man. When the man saw Jesus, he fell down before him, shouting loudly, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Please, don’t punish me!”
42008029	
42008041	A man named Jairus came to him. He was a leader of the synagogue. He had only one daughter. She was twelve years old, and she was dying. So Jairus bowed down at the feet of Jesus and begged him to come to his house. While Jesus was going to Jairus’ house, the people crowded all around him.
42008042	
42011005	Then Jesus said to them, “Suppose one of you went to your friend’s house very late at night and said to him, ‘A friend of mine has come into town to visit me. But I have nothing for him to eat. Please give me three loaves of bread.’
42011006	
42020018	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken. If that stone falls on you, it will crush you!”
42020044	David calls the Messiah ‘Lord.’ So how can the Messiah also be David’s son?”
42022039	Jesus left the city and went to the Mount of Olives. His followers went with him. (He went there often.) He said to his followers, “Pray for strength against temptation.”
42022040	
42023050	A man named Joseph was there from the Jewish town of Arimathea. He was a good man, who lived the way God wanted. He was waiting for God’s kingdom to come. Joseph was a member of the Jewish council. But he did not agree when the other Jewish leaders decided to kill Jesus.
42023051	
42024047	You saw these things happen—you are witnesses. You must go and tell people that they must change and turn to God, which will bring them his forgiveness. You must start from Jerusalem and tell this message in my name to the people of all nations.
42024048	
43001032	Then John said this for everyone to hear: “I also did not know who the Messiah was. But the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘You will see the Spirit come down and rest on a man. He is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ I have seen this happen. I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on this man. So this is what I tell people: ‘He is the Son of God.’”
43001033	
43001034	
43012039	This is why the people could not believe. Because Isaiah also said,
43012041	Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ divine greatness. So he spoke about him.
44001016	“Brothers and sisters, in the Scriptures the Holy Spirit said through David that something must happen. He was talking about Judas, one of our own group. Judas served together with us. The Spirit said that Judas would lead men to arrest Jesus.”
44001017	
44001021	“So now another man must join us and be a witness of Jesus’ resurrection. He must be one of those men who were part of our group during all the time the Lord Jesus was with us. He must have been with us from the time John was baptizing people until the day when Jesus was carried up from us into heaven.”
44001022	
44001024	They prayed, “Lord, you know the minds of all people. Show us which one of these two men you choose to do this work. Judas turned away from it and went where he belongs. Lord, show us which man should take his place as an apostle!”
44001025	
44002032	So Jesus is the one God raised from death. We are all witnesses of this. We saw him.
44002033	Jesus was lifted up to heaven. Now he is with God, at God’s right side. The Father has given the Holy Spirit to him, as he promised. So Jesus has now poured out that Spirit. This is what you see and hear.
44002034	David was not the one who was lifted up to heaven. David himself said, ‘The Lord God said to my Lord: Sit at my right side,
44003009	All the people recognized him. They knew he was the crippled man who always sat by the Beautiful Gate to beg for money. Now they saw this same man walking and praising God. They were amazed. They did not understand how this could happen.
44003010	
44004012	Jesus is the only one who can save people. His name is the only power in the world that has been given to save anyone. We must be saved through him!”
44004021	The Jewish leaders could not find a way to punish the apostles, because all the people were praising God for what had been done. This miracle was a sign from God. The man who was healed was more than 40 years old. So the Jewish leaders warned the apostles again and let them go free.
44004022	
44004027	That’s what actually happened when Herod, Pontius Pilate, the other nations, and the people of Israel all came together against Jesus here in Jerusalem. He is your holy Servant, the one you made to be the Messiah.
44004028	These people who came together against Jesus made your plan happen. It was done because of your power and your will.
44004029	And now, Lord, listen to what they are saying. They are trying to make us afraid. We are your servants. Help us to say what you want us to say without fear.
44004030	Help us to be brave by showing us your power. Make sick people well. Cause miraculous signs and wonders to happen by the authority of Jesus, your holy servant.”
44005005	When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. Some young men came and wrapped his body. They carried it out and buried it. And everyone who heard about this was filled with fear.
44005006	
44008001	Saul agreed that the killing of Stephen was a good thing. Some godly men buried Stephen and cried loudly for him. On that day the Jews began to persecute the church in Jerusalem, making them suffer very much. Saul was also trying to destroy the group. He went into their houses, dragged out men and women, and put them in jail. All the believers left Jerusalem. Only the apostles stayed. The believers went to different places in Judea and Samaria.
44008002	
44008003	
44011023	Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith. When he went to Antioch and saw how God had blessed the believers there, he was very happy. He encouraged them all, saying, “Always be faithful to the Lord. Serve him with all your heart.” Many more people became followers of the Lord.
44011024	
44013034	God raised Jesus from death. Jesus will never go back to the grave and become dust. So God said, ‘I will give you the true and holy promises that I made to David.’
44013035	But in another Psalm it says, ‘You will not let your Holy One rot in the grave.’
44013036	“David did God’s will during the time he lived. Then he died and was buried like all his ancestors. And his body did rot in the grave!
44013037	But the one God raised from death did not rot in the grave.
44013038	Brothers, understand what we are telling you. You can have forgiveness of your sins through this Jesus. The Law of Moses could not free you from your sins. But you can be made right with God if you believe in Jesus.
44013039	
44013040	So be careful! Don’t let what the prophets said happen to you:
44015021	They should not do any of these things, because there are still men in every city who teach the Law of Moses. The words of Moses have been read in the synagogue every Sabbath day for many years.”
44015024	We have heard that some men have come to you from our group. What they said troubled and upset you. But we did not tell them to do this.
44015025	We have all agreed to choose some men and send them to you. They will be with our dear friends, Barnabas and Paul.
44015026	Barnabas and Paul have given their lives to serve our Lord Jesus Christ.
44015027	So we have sent Judas and Silas with them. They will tell you the same things.
44015028	We agree with the Holy Spirit that you should have no more burdens, except for these necessary things:
44015029	Don’t eat food that has been given to idols. Don’t eat meat from animals that have been strangled or any meat that still has the blood in it. Don’t be involved in sexual sin. If you stay away from these, you will do well. We say goodbye now.
44019013	Some Jews also were traveling around forcing evil spirits out of people. The seven sons of Sceva, one of the leading priests, were doing this. These Jews tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus to make the evil spirits go out of people. They all said, “By the same Jesus that Paul talks about, I order you to come out!”
44019014	
44020037	They cried and cried. They were especially sad because Paul had said they would never see him again. They hugged him and kissed him. Then they went with him to the ship to say goodbye.
44020038	
44021035	The whole crowd was following them. When the soldiers came to the steps, they had to carry Paul. They did this to protect him, because the people were ready to hurt him. The people were shouting, “Kill him!”
44021036	
44023026	From Claudius Lysias, To the Most Honorable Governor Felix. Greetings:
44023027	Some Jews had taken this man and planned to kill him. But I learned that he is a Roman citizen, so I went with my soldiers and saved him.
44023028	I wanted to know why they were accusing him. So I brought him before their council meeting.
44023029	This is what I learned: The Jews said this man did some things that were wrong. But these charges were about their own Jewish laws, and there was nothing worthy of jail or death.
44023030	I was told that some of the Jews were making a plan to kill him. So I decided to send him to you. I also told those Jews to tell you what they have against him.
44024002	Paul was called into the meeting, and Tertullus began to make his accusations. Tertullus said, “Most Honorable Felix, our people enjoy much peace because of you, and many wrong things in our country are being made right through your wise help. For this we all continue to be very thankful.
44024003	
44024006	Also, he was trying to make the Temple unclean, but we stopped him. You can decide if all this is true. Ask him some questions yourself.”
44024008	
44024017	“I was away from Jerusalem for many years. I went back there to take money to help my people. I also had some gifts to offer at the Temple. I was doing this when some Jews saw me there. I had finished the cleansing ceremony. I had not made any trouble, and no one was gathering around me.
44024018	
44028010	The people on the island gave us many honors. And after we had been there three months and were ready to leave, they provided us everything we needed for our trip. We got on a ship from Alexandria that had stayed on the island of Malta during the winter. On the front of the ship was the sign for the twin gods.
44028011	
45001003	The Good News is about God’s Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. As a human, he was born from the family of David, but through the Holy Spirit he was shown to be God’s powerful Son when he was raised from death.
45001004	
45001009	Every time I pray, I always remember you. God knows this is true. He is the one I serve with all my heart by telling people the Good News about his Son. I pray that I will be allowed to come to you. It will happen if God wants it.
45001010	
45003025	God gave Jesus as a way to forgive people’s sins through their faith in him. God can forgive them because the blood sacrifice of Jesus pays for their sins. God gave Jesus to show that he always does what is right and fair. He was right in the past when he was patient and did not punish people for their sins. And in our own time he still does what is right. God worked all this out in a way that allows him to judge people fairly and still make right any person who has faith in Jesus.
45003026	
45008038	Yes, I am sure that nothing can separate us from God’s love—not death, life, angels, or ruling spirits. I am sure that nothing now, nothing in the future, no powers, nothing above us or nothing below us—nothing in the whole created world—will ever be able to separate us from the love God has shown us in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45008039	
45009011	But before the two sons were born, God told Rebecca, “The older son will serve the younger.” This was before the boys had done anything good or bad. God said this before they were born so that the boy he wanted would be chosen because of God’s own plan. He was chosen because he was the one God wanted to call, not because of anything the boys did.
45009012	
45009026	And, “Where God said in the past, ‘You are not my people’— there they will be called children of the living God.”
45009027	And Isaiah cries out about Israel: “There are so many people of Israel, they are like the grains of sand by the sea. But only a few of them will be saved.
45009029	It is just as Isaiah said: “The Lord All-Powerful allowed some of our people to live. If he had not done that, we would now be like Sodom, and we would be like Gomorrah.”
45010019	Again I ask, “Did the people of Israel not understand?” Yes, they did understand. First, Moses says this for God: “I will use those who are not really a nation to make you jealous. I will use a nation that does not understand to make you angry.”
45010020	Then Isaiah is bold enough to say this for God: “The people who were not looking for me— they are the ones who found me. I made myself known to those who did not ask for me.”
45010021	But about the people of Israel God says, “All day long I stood ready to accept those people, but they are stubborn and refuse to obey me.”
45011009	And David says, “Let those people be caught and trapped at their own feasts. Let them fall and be punished.
45012020	But you should do this: “If you have enemies who are hungry, give them something to eat. If you have enemies who are thirsty, give them something to drink. In doing this you will make them feel ashamed.”
45012021	Don’t let evil defeat you, but defeat evil by doing good.
45014012	So each of us will have to explain to God about the things we do.
45015010	And the Scriptures say, “You people of other nations should be happy together with God’s people.”
45015011	The Scriptures also say, “Praise the Lord all you people of other nations; all people should praise the Lord.”
45015012	And Isaiah says, “Someone will come from Jesse’s family. He will come to rule over the nations, and they will put their hope in him.”
45016003	Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, who have worked together with me for Christ Jesus.
45016004	They risked their own lives to save mine. I am thankful to them, and all the non-Jewish churches are thankful to them.
45016005	Also, give greetings to the church that meets in their house. Give greetings to my dear friend Epaenetus. He was the first person to follow Christ in Asia.
45016006	Greetings also to Mary. She worked very hard for you.
45016007	And greet Andronicus and Junia. They are my relatives, and they were in prison with me. They were followers of Christ before I was. And they are some of the most important of the ones Christ sent out to do his work.
45016008	Give my greetings to Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord,
45016009	and to Urbanus. He has worked together with me for Christ. Give greetings also to my dear friend Stachys
45016010	and to Apelles, who has proved himself to be a true follower of Christ. Give greetings to everyone in the family of Aristobulus
45016011	and to Herodion, my relative. Greetings to all those in the family of Narcissus who belong to the Lord
45016012	and to Tryphaena and Tryphosa, women who work very hard for the Lord. Greetings to my dear friend Persis. She has also worked very hard for the Lord.
45016013	Greetings also to Rufus, one of the Lord’s chosen people, and to his mother, who has been a mother to me too.
45016014	Give my greetings to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and all the brothers in Christ who are with them.
45016015	Give greetings to Philologus and Julia, to Nereus and his sister, to Olympas, and to all of God’s people with them.
45016016	Give each other the special greeting of God’s people. All the churches that belong to Christ send their greetings to you.
46002010	But God has shown us these things through the Spirit. The Spirit knows all things. The Spirit even knows the deep secrets of God.
46005012	It is not my business to judge those who are not part of the group of believers. God will judge them, but you must judge those who are part of your group. The Scriptures say, “Make the evil person leave your group.”
46005013	
46006009	Surely you know that people who do wrong will not get to enjoy God’s kingdom. Don’t be fooled. These are the people who will not get to enjoy his kingdom: those who sin sexually, those who worship idols, those who commit adultery, men who let other men use them for sex or who have sex with other men, those who steal, those who are greedy, those who drink too much, those who abuse others with insults, and those who cheat.
46006010	
46012018	If each part of the body were the same part, there would be no body. But as it is, God put the parts in the body as he wanted them. He made a place for each one.
46012019	
46015056	Death’s power to hurt is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
46015057	But we thank God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!
47009010	God is the one who gives seed to those who plant, and he gives bread for food. And God will give you spiritual seed and make that seed grow. He will produce a great harvest from your goodness.
47009011	God will make you rich in every way so that you can always give freely. And your giving through us will make people give thanks to God.
47012003	And I know that this man was taken up to paradise. I don’t know if he was in his body or away from his body, but he heard things that he is not able to explain. He heard things that no one is allowed to tell.
47012004	
48003026	You were all baptized into Christ, and so you were all clothed with Christ. This shows that you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
48003027	
48004010	It worries me that you follow teachings about special days, months, seasons, and years. I fear that my work for you has been wasted.
48004011	
49001015	That is why I always remember you in my prayers and thank God for you. I have done this ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all of God’s people.
49001016	
50001010	that you will see the difference between what is important and what is not and choose what is important; that you will be pure and blameless for the coming of Christ;
50001011	that your life will be full of the many good works that are produced by Jesus Christ to bring glory and praise to God.
51001010	that this will help you live in a way that brings honor to the Lord and pleases him in every way; that your life will produce good works of every kind and that you will grow in your knowledge of God;
51001011	that God will strengthen you with his own great power so that you will be patient and not give up when troubles come. Then you will be happy
52003001	We could not come to you, but it was very hard to wait any longer. So we decided to send Timothy to you and stay in Athens alone. Timothy is our brother. He works with us for God to tell people the Good News about Christ. We sent Timothy to strengthen and encourage you in your faith.
52003002	
53002016	We pray that the Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father will comfort you and strengthen you in every good thing you do and say. God loved us and gave us through his grace a wonderful hope and comfort that has no end.
