40006014	For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
40006015	But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.
40011011	Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
40011012	From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people have been raiding it.
40011013	For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
40011014	And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.
40011015	Whoever has ears, let them hear.
40011018	For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, “He has a demon.”
40011019	The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, “Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.” But wisdom is proved right by her deeds.’
40013014	In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: ‘ “You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.
40013016	But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
40013017	For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.
40022045	If then David calls him “Lord”, how can he be his son?’
40022046	No-one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no-one dared to ask him any more questions.
40026032	But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.’
41001004	And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
41001005	The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptised by him in the River Jordan.
41001006	John wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt round his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
41001007	And this was his message: ‘After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.
41001008	I baptise you with water, but he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit.’
41007008	You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions.’
41009049	Everyone will be salted with fire.
41012037	David himself calls him “Lord”. How then can he be his son?’ The large crowd listened to him with delight.
41014028	But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.’
42001047	and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour,
42001048	for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed,
42001049	for the Mighty One has done great things for me – holy is his name.
42001050	His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.
42001051	He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.
42001052	He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.
42001053	He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.
42001054	He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful
42001055	to Abraham and his descendants for ever, just as he promised our ancestors.’
42001068	‘Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come to his people and redeemed them.
42001069	He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David
42001070	(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),
42001071	salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us –
42001072	to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant,
42001073	the oath he swore to our father Abraham:
42001074	to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear
42001075	in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
42001076	And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,
42001077	to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,
42001078	because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven
42001079	to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace.’
42002029	‘Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace.
42002030	For my eyes have seen your salvation,
42002031	which you have prepared in the sight of all nations:
42002032	a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel.’

42003038	the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
42007033	For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, “He has a demon.”
42007034	The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, “Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.”
42007035	But wisdom is proved right by all her children.’
42020018	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.’
42020044	David calls him “Lord.” How then can he be his son?’
42023031	For if people do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?’
43012014	Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written:
43012041	Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him.
44001021	Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus was living among us,
44001022	beginning from John’s baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection.’
44004012	Salvation is found in no-one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.’
44004027	Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed.
44004028	They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen.
44004029	Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness.
44004030	Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.’
44013034	God raised him from the dead so that he will never be subject to decay. As God has said, ‘ “I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.”
44013035	So it is also stated elsewhere: ‘ “You will not let your holy one see decay.”
44015024	We have heard that some went out from us without our authorisation and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said.
44015025	So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul –
44015026	men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
44015027	Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing.
44015028	It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements:
44015029	You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell.
44023026	Claudius Lysias, To His Excellency, Governor Felix: Greetings.
44023027	This man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, but I came with my troops and rescued him, for I had learned that he is a Roman citizen.
44023028	I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him to their Sanhedrin.
44023029	I found that the accusation had to do with questions about their law, but there was no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment.
44023030	When I was informed of a plot to be carried out against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also ordered his accusers to present to you their case against him.
45008037	No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
45008038	For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
45008039	neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45009016	It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.
45009017	For Scripture says to Pharaoh: ‘I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.’
45009018	Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.
45009026	and, ‘In the very place where it was said to them, “You are not my people,” there they will be called “children of the living God.” ’
45009027	Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: ‘Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved.
45009029	It is just as Isaiah said previously: ‘Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.’
45010019	Again I ask: did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, ‘I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding.’
45010020	And Isaiah boldly says, ‘I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.’
45010021	But concerning Israel he says, ‘All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.’
45011009	And David says: ‘May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling-block and a retribution for them.
45012021	Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
45014012	So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.
45015010	Again, it says, ‘Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.’
45015011	And again, ‘Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; let all the peoples extol him.’
45015012	And again, Isaiah says, ‘The Root of Jesse will spring up, one who will arise to rule over the nations; in him the Gentiles will hope.’
45015022	This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.
46002010	these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
46015033	Do not be misled: ‘Bad company corrupts good character.’
46015034	Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God – I say this to your shame.
46015056	The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
46015057	But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
47006017	Therefore, ‘Come out from them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you.’
47006018	And, ‘I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.’
47009010	Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.
47009011	You will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.
49004009	(What does ‘he ascended’ mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions?
49004010	He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.)
49004011	So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers,
49004012	to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up
49004013	until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
58001006	And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, ‘Let all God’s angels worship him.’
58001007	In speaking of the angels he says, ‘He makes his angels spirits, and his servants flames of fire.’
58001008	But about the Son he says, ‘Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; a sceptre of justice will be the sceptre of your kingdom.
58001010	He also says, ‘In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
58001013	To which of the angels did God ever say, ‘Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet’?
58001014	Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?
58002009	But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now crowned with glory and honour because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.
58002013	And again, ‘I will put my trust in him.’ And again he says, ‘Here am I, and the children God has given me.’
