40010030	`And alle the heeris of youre heed ben noumbrid.
40010031	Therfor nyle ye drede; ye ben betere than many sparewis.
40010032	Therfor euery man that schal knouleche me bifore men, Y schal knouleche hym bifor my fadir that is in heuenes.
40017014	And whanne he cam to the puple, a man cam to hym, and felde doun on hise knees bifor hym, and seide,
40017015	Lord, haue merci on my sone; for he is lunatike, and suffrith yuele, for ofte tymes he fallith in to the fier, and ofte tymes in to water.
40017016	And Y brouyte hym to thi disciplis, and thei myyten not heele hym.
40017017	Jhesus answeride, and seide, A! thou generacion vnbileueful and weiward; hou long schal Y be with you? hou long schal Y suffre you? Brynge ye hym hider to me.
40017018	And Jhesus blamede hym, and the deuel wente out fro hym; and the child was heelid fro that our.
40017019	Thanne the disciplis camen to Jhesu priueli, and seiden to hym, Whi myyten not we caste hym out?
40017020	Jhesus seith to hem, For youre vnbileue. Treuli Y seie to you, if ye han feith, as a corn of seneueye, ye schulen seie to this hil, Passe thou hennus, and it schal passe; and no thing schal be vnpossible to you;
40017021	but this kynde is not caste out, but bi preiyng and fastyng.
40017022	And whilis thei weren abidynge togidere in Galilee, Jhesus seide to hem, Mannus sone schal be bitraied in to the hondis of men;
40017023	and thei schulen sle hym, and the thridde day he schal rise ayen to lijf.
40017024	And thei weren ful sori. And whanne thei camen to Cafarnaum, thei that token tribute, camen to Petre, and seiden to hym, Youre maister payeth not tribute?
40017025	And he seide, Yhis. And whanne he was comen in to the hous, Jhesus cam bifor hym, and seide, Symount, what semeth to thee? Kyngis of erthe, of whom taken thei tribute? of her sones, ether of aliens?
40017026	And he seide, Of aliens. Jhesus seide to hym, Thanne sones ben fre.
40017027	But that we sclaundre hem not, go to the see, and caste an hook, and take thilke fisch that first cometh vp; and, whanne his mouth is opened, thou schalt fynde a stater, and yyue for thee and for me.
40020026	It schal not be so among you; but who euer wole be maad gretter among you, be he youre mynystre;
40020027	and who euer among you wole be the firste, he schal be youre seruaunt.
40022005	But thei dispisiden, and wenten forth, oon in to his toun, anothir to his marchaundise.
40022006	But othere helden his seruauntis, and turmentiden hem, and slowen.
41002027	And he seide to hem, The sabat is maad for man, and not a man for the sabat;
41002028	and so mannus sone is lord also of the sabat.
41004040	And he seide to hem, What dreden ye? `Ye han no feith yit?
41004041	And thei dredden with greet drede, and seiden `ech to other, Who, gessist thou, is this? for the wynde and the see obeschen to hym.
42007041	And he answeride, Twei dettouris weren to o lener; and oon auyt fyue hundrid pans, and `the other fifti;
42007042	but whanne thei hadden not wherof `thei schulden yeelde, he foryaf to bothe. Who thanne loueth hym more?
43011056	Therfor thei souyten Jhesu, and spaken togidere, stondynge in the temple, What gessen ye, for he cometh not to the feeste day?
43011057	For the bischopis and Farisees hadden youun a maundement, that if ony man knowe where he is, that he schewe, that thei take hym.
43015026	But whanne the coumfortour schal come, which Y schal sende to you fro the fadir, a spirit of treuthe, which cometh of the fadir, he schal bere witnessyng of me;
43015027	and ye schulen bere witnessyng, for ye ben with me fro the bigynnyng.
44005041	And thei wenten ioiynge fro the siyt of the counsel, that thei weren had worthi to suffre dispisyng for the name of Jhesu.
44005042	But ech dai thei ceessiden not in the temple, and aboute housis, to teche and to preche Jhesu Crist.
44007055	But whanne Steuene was ful of the Hooli Goost, he bihelde in to heuene, and say the glorie of God, and Jhesu stondinge on the riythalf of the vertu of God.
44007056	And he seide, Lo! Y se heuenes openyd, and mannus sone stondynge on the riythalf of the vertu of God.
44007057	And thei crieden with a greet vois, and stoppiden her eris, and maden with o wille an assauyt in to hym.
44007058	And thei brouyten hym out of the citee, and stonyden. And the witnessis diden of her clothis, bisidis the feet of a yong man, that was clepid Saule.
44007059	And thei stonyden Steuene, that clepide God to help, seiynge, Lord Jhesu, resseyue my spirit.
44007060	And he knelide, and criede with a greet vois, and seide, Lord, sette not to hem this synne. And whanne he hadde seid this thing, he diede.	
44014006	thei vndurstoden, and fledden togidere to the citees of Licaonye, and Listris, and Derben, and into al the cuntre aboute.
44014007	And thei prechiden there the gospel, and al the multitude was moued togider in the teching of hem. Poul and Barnabas dwelten at Listris.
44014008	And a man at Listris was sijk in the feet, and hadde sete crokid fro his modris wombe, which neuer hadde goen.
44014009	This herde Poul spekinge; and Poul biheld hym, and siy that he hadde feith, that he schulde be maad saaf,
44014010	and seide with a greet vois, Rise thou `vp riyt on thi feet. And he lippide, and walkide.
44014011	And the puple, whanne thei hadde seyn that that Poul dide, reriden her vois in Licaon tunge, and seiden, Goddis maad lijk to men ben comun doun to vs.
44014012	And thei clepiden Barnabas Jubiter, and Poul Mercurie, for he was ledere of the word.
44014013	And the preest of Jubiter that was bifor the citee, brouyte boolis and crownes bifor the yatis, with puplis, and wolde haue maad sacrifice.
44014014	And whanne the apostlis Barnabas and Poul herden this, thei to-renten her cootis; and thei skipten out among the puple,
44014015	and crieden, and seiden, Men, what don ye this thing? and we ben deedli men lijk you, and schewen to you, that ye be conuertid fro these veyn thingis to the lyuynge God, that maad heuene, and erthe, and the see, and alle thingis that ben in hem;
44014016	which in generaciouns passid suffride alle folkis to gon in to her owne weies.
44014017	And yit he lefte not hym silf with out witnessing in wel doyng, for he yaf reyns fro heuene, and times beringe fruyt, and fulfillide youre hertis with meete and gladnesse.
44014018	And thei seiynge these thingis, vnnethis swagiden the puple, that thei offriden not to hem.
44014019	But sum Jewis camen ouer fro Antioche and Iconye, and counseilden the puple, and stonyden Poul, and drowen out of the citee, and gessiden that he was deed.
44014020	But whanne disciplis weren comun aboute him, he roos, and wente in to the citee; and in the dai suynge he wente forth with Barnabas in to Derben.
44014021	And whanne thei hadden prechid to the ilk citee, and tauyte manye, thei turneden ayen to Listris, and Iconye, and to Antioche; confermynge the soulis of disciplis,
44014022	and monestinge, that thei schulden dwelle in feith, and seiden, That bi many tribulaciouns it bihoueth vs to entre in to the kingdom of heuenes.
44014023	And whanne thei hadden ordeined prestis to hem bi alle citees, and hadden preied with fastyngis, thei bitoken hem to the Lord, in whom thei bileueden.
44014024	And thei passiden Persidie, and camen to Pamfilie;
44014025	and thei spaken the word `of the Lord in Pergen, and camen doun in to Italie.
44014026	And fro thennys thei wenten bi boot to Antiochie, fro whennus thei weren takun to the grace of God, in to the werk that thei filliden.
44014027	And whanne thei weren comun, and hadden gaderid the chirche, thei telden hou grete thingis God dide with hem, and that he hadde openyde to hethene men the dore of feith.
44014028	And thei dwelliden not a litil tyme with the disciplis.
45006022	But now ye delyuered fro synne, and maad seruauntis to God, han your fruyt in to holinesse, and the ende euerlastinge lijf.
45006023	For the wagis of synne is deth; the grace of God is euerlastynge lijf in Crist Jhesu our Lord.
45015032	that Y come to you in ioye, bi the wille of God, and that Y be refreischid with you.
45015033	And God of pees be with you alle. Amen.
47001023	For Y clepide God to witnesse ayens my soule, that Y sparynge you cam not ouer to Corynthe;
47001024	not that we ben lordis of youre feith, but we ben helperis of youre ioye; for thorouy bileue ye stonden.
48003019	What thanne the lawe? It was sett for trespassing, to the seed come, to whom he hadde maad his biheest. Whiche lawe was ordeyned bi aungels, in the hoond of a mediatour.
48003020	But a mediatour is not of oon. But God is oon.
48005025	If we lyuen bi spirit, walke we bi spirit;
48005026	be we not made coueytouse of veyn glorie, stirynge ech othere to wraththe, or hauynge enuye ech to othere.
52004011	and that ye do youre nede, and `ye worche with youre hoondis, as we han comaundid to you;
52004012	and that ye wandre onestli to hem that ben with outforth, and that of no mannus ye desir ony thing.
52004013	For, britheren, we wolen not, that ye vnknowe of men that dien, that ye be not soreuful, as othere that han not hope.
52004014	For if we bileuen, that Jhesu was deed, and roos ayen, so God schal lede with hym hem that ben deed bi Jhesu.
52004015	And we seien this thing to you in the word of the Lord, that we that lyuen, that ben left in the comyng of the Lord, schulen not come bifor hem that ben deed.
52004016	For the Lord hym silf schal come doun fro heuene, in the comaundement, and in the vois of an archaungel, and in the trumpe of God; and the deed men that ben in Crist, schulen rise ayen first.
52004017	Afterward we that lyuen, that ben left, schulen be rauyschid togidere with hem in cloudis, metinge Crist `in to the eir; and so euere more we schulen be with the Lord.
52004018	Therfor be ye coumfortid togidere in these wordis.
53002010	and grete wondris, false, and in al disseit of wickidnesse, to hem that perischen. For that thei resseyueden not the charite of treuthe, that thei schulden be maad saaf.
53002011	And therfor God schal sende to hem a worching of errour, that thei bileue to leesing,
53002012	that alle be demed, whiche bileueden not to treuthe, but consentiden to wickidnesse.
53002013	But, britheren louyd of God, we owen to do thankyngis euermore to God for you, that God chees vs the firste fruytis in to heelthe, in halewing of spirit and in feith of treuthe;
53002014	in which also he clepide you bi oure gospel, in to geting of the glorie of oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
53002015	Therfor, britheren, stonde ye, and holde ye the tradiciouns, that ye han lerud, ethir bi word, ethir bi oure pistle.
53002016	And oure Lord Jhesu Crist him silf, and God oure fadir, which louyde vs, and yaf euerlastinge coumfort and good hope in grace, stire youre hertis,
53002017	and conferme in al good werk and word.
55003016	For al scripture inspirid of God is profitable to teche, to repreue, to chastice, to lerne in riytwisnes,
55003017	that the man of God be parfit, lerud to al good werk.
60004018	And if a iust man vnnethe schal be sauid, where schulen the vnfeithful man and the synnere appere?
60004019	Therfor and thei that suffren bi the wille of God, bitaken her soulis in good dedis to the feithful makere of nouyt.
66010010	And Y took the book of the aungels hond, and deuouride it, and it was in my mouth as swete hony; and whanne Y hadde deuourid it, my wombe was bittere.
66010011	And he seide to me, It bihoueth thee eftsoone to prophesie to hethene men, and to puplis, and langagis, and to many kingis.
