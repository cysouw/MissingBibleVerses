44015024	Since we have heard that some have gone out from among us with no orders from us and have confused you, upsetting your minds by what they said,
44015025	we have unanimously decided to choose men to send to you along with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul,
44015026	who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
44015027	Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas who will tell you these things themselves in person.
44015028	For it seemed best to the Holy Spirit and to us not to place any greater burden on you than these necessary rules:
44015029	that you abstain from meat that has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what has been strangled and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from doing these things, you will do well. Farewell.
44023026	Claudius Lysias to His Excellency Governor Felix, greetings.
44023027	This man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, when I came up with the detachment and rescued him, because I had learned that he was a Roman citizen.
44023028	Since I wanted to know what charge they were accusing him of, I brought him down to their council.
44023029	I found he was accused with reference to controversial questions about their law, but no charge against him deserved death or imprisonment.
44023030	When I was informed there would be a plot against this man, I sent him to you at once, also ordering his accusers to state their charges against him before you.
