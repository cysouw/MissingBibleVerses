40001018	But the generacioun of Crist was thus . Whanne Marie , the modir of Jhesu , was spousid to Joseph , bifore thei camen togidere , she was foundun hauynge of the Hooli Goost in the wombe .
40001019	And Joseph , hir hosebonde , for he was riytful , and wolde not puplische hir , he wolde priueli haue left hir .
40001020	But while he thouyte thes thingis , lo ! the aungel of the Lord apperide ` in sleep to hym , and seide , Joseph , the sone of Dauid , nyle thou drede to take Marie , thi wijf ; for that thing that is borun in hir is of the Hooli Goost .
40001021	And she shal bere a sone , and thou shalt clepe his name Jhesus ; for he schal make his puple saaf fro her synnes .
40001022	For al this thing was don , that it schulde be fulfillid , that was seid of the Lord bi a prophete , seiynge , Lo !
40001023	a virgyn shal haue in wombe , and she schal bere a sone , and thei schulen clepe his name Emanuel , that is to seie , God with vs .
40001024	And Joseph roos fro sleepe , and dide as the aungel of the Lord comaundide hym , and took Marie , his wijf ;
40001025	and he knew her not , til she hadde borun her firste bigete sone , and clepide his name Jhesus .
40002001	Therfor whanne Jhesus was borun in Bethleem of Juda , in the daies of king Eroude , lo ! astromyenes camen fro the eest to Jerusalem ,
40002002	and seiden , Where is he , that is borun king of Jewis ? for we han seyn his sterre in the eest , and we comen to worschipe him .
40002003	But king Eroude herde , and was trublid , and al Jerusalem with hym .
40002004	And he gaderide to gidre alle the prynces of prestis , and scribis of the puple , and enqueride of hem , where Crist shulde be borun .
40002005	And thei seiden to hym , In Bethleem of Juda ; for so it is writun bi a profete ,
40002006	And thou , Bethleem , the lond of Juda , art not the leest among the prynces of Juda ; for of thee a duyk schal go out , that schal gouerne my puple of Israel .
40002007	Thanne Eroude clepide pryueli the astromyens , and lernyde bisili of hem the tyme of the sterre that apperide to hem .
40002008	And he sente hem in to Bethleem , and seide , Go ye , and axe ye bisili of the child , and whanne yee han foundun , telle ye it to me , that Y also come , and worschipe hym .
40002009	And whanne thei hadden herd the kyng , thei wenten forth . And lo ! the sterre , that thei siyen in the eest , wente bifore hem , til it cam , and stood aboue , where the child was .
40002010	And thei siyen the sterre , and ioyeden with a ful greet ioye .
40002011	And thei entriden in to the hous , and founden the child with Marie , his modir ; and thei felden doun , and worschipiden him . And whanne thei hadden openyd her tresouris , thei offryden to hym yiftis , gold , encense , and myrre .
40002012	And whanne thei hadden take an aunswere in sleep , that thei schulden not turne ayen to Eroude , thei turneden ayen bi anothir weie in to her cuntrey .
40002013	And whanne thei weren goon , lo ! the aungel of the Lord apperide to Joseph in sleep , and seide , Rise vp , and take the child and his modir , and fle in to Egipt , and be thou there , til that I seie to thee ; for it is to come , that Eroude seke the child , to destrie hym .
40002014	And Joseph roos , and took the child and his modir bi nyyt , and wente in to Egipt ,
40002015	and he was there to the deeth of Eroude ; that it schulde be fulfillid , that was seid of the Lord bi the profete , seiynge , Fro Egipt Y haue clepid my sone .
40002016	Thanne Eroude seynge that he was disseyued of the astromyens , was ful wrooth ; and he sente , and slowe alle the children , that weren in Bethleem , and in alle the coostis therof , fro two yeer age and with inne , aftir the tyme that he had enquerid of the astromyens .
40002017	Thanne ` it was fulfillid , that was seid bi Jeremye , the profete ,
40002018	seiynge , A vois was herd an hiy , wepynge and moche weilyng , Rachel biwepynge hir sones , and she wolde not be coumfortid , for thei ben noyt .
40002019	But whanne Eroude was deed , loo ! the aungel of the Lord apperide to Joseph in sleep in Egipt ,
40002020	and seide , Ryse vp , and take the child and his modir , and go in to the lond of Israel ; for thei that souyten the lijf of the chijld ben deed .
40002021	Joseph roos , and took the child and his modir , and cam in to the loond of Israel .
40002022	And he herde that Archilaus regnede in Judee for Eroude , his fadir , and dredde to go thidir . And he was warned in sleep , and wente in to the parties of Galilee ;
40002023	and cam , and dwelte in a citee , that ys clepid Nazareth , that it shulde be fulfillid , that was seid bi profetis , For he shal be clepid a Nazarey .
40003001	In tho daies Joon Baptist cam , and prechide in the desert of Judee ,
40003002	and seide , Do ye penaunce , for the kyngdom of heuenes shal neiye .
40003003	For this is he , of whom it is seid bi Ysaie , the prophete , seyinge , A vois of a crier in desert , Make ye redi the weies of the Lord ; make ye riyt the pathis of hym .
40003004	And this Joon hadde clothing of camels heeris , and a girdil of skynne aboute hise leendis ; and his mete was honysoukis , and hony of the wode .
40003005	Thanne Jerusalem wente out to hym , and al Judee , and al the cuntre aboute Jordan ;
40003006	and thei weren waischun of hym in Jordan , ` and knowlechiden her synnes .
40003007	But he siy manye of the Farysees and of Saduceis comynge to his baptym , and seide to hem , Generaciouns of eddris , who shewide to you to fle fro the wraththe that is to come ?
40003008	Therfor do ye worthi fruyte of penaunce ,
40003009	and nyle ye seie with ynne you , We han Abraham to fadir ; for Y seie to you , that God is myyti to reise vp of these stoones the sones of Abraham .
40003010	And now the ax is put to the roote of the tree ; therfore euery tree that makith not good fruyt , shal be kit doun , and shal be cast in to the fier .
40003011	Y waische you in water , in to penaunce ; but he that shal come after me is strongere than Y , whos schoon Y am not worthi to bere ; he shal baptise you in the Hooli Goost and fier .
40003012	Whos wynewing cloth is in his hoond , and he shal fulli clense his corn flore , and shal gadere his whete in to his berne ; but the chaffe he shal brenne with fier that mai not be quenchid .
40003013	Thanne Jhesus cam fro Galilee in to Jordan to Joon , to be baptised of hym .
40003014	And Joon forbede him , and seide , Y owe to be baptisid of thee , and thou comest to me ?
40003015	But Jhesus answeride , and seide to hym , Suffre nowe , for thus it fallith to vs to fulfille al riytfulnesse .
40003016	Thanne Joon suffride hym . And whanne Jhesus was baptisid , anoon he wente up fro the watir ; and lo ! heuenes weren openyd to hym , and he saie the Spirit of God comynge doun as a dowue , and comynge on hym ; and loo !
40003017	a vois fro heuenes , seiynge , This is my louyd sone , in which Y haue plesid to me .
40004001	Thanne Jhesus was led of a spirit in to desert , to be temptid of the feend .
40004002	And whanne he hadde fastid fourti daies and fourti nyytis , aftirward he hungride .
40004003	And the tempter cam nyy , and seide to hym , If thou art Goddis sone , seie that thes stoones be maad looues .
40004004	Which answeride , and seide to hym , It is writun , Not oonli in breed luyeth man , but in ech word that cometh of Goddis mouth .
40004005	Thanne the feend took hym in to the hooli citee , and settide hym on the pynacle of the temple ,
40004006	and seide to hym , If thou art Goddis sone , sende thee adoun ; for it is writun , That to hise aungels he comaundide of thee , and thei schulen take thee in hondis , lest perauenture thou hirte thi foot at a stoon .
40004007	Eftsoone Jhesus seide to hym , It is writun , Thou shalt not tempte thi Lord God .
40004008	Eftsoone the feend took hym in to a ful hiy hil , and schewide to hym alle the rewmes of the world , and the ioye of hem ;
40004009	and seide to hym , Alle these ` Y schal yyue to thee , if thou falle doun and worschipe me .
40004010	Thanne Jhesus seide to hym , Goo , Sathanas ; for it is writun , Thou schalt worschipe thi Lord God , and to hym aloone thou shalt serue .
40004011	Thanne the feend lafte hym ; and lo ! aungels camen nyy , and serueden to hym .
40004012	But whanne Jhesus hadde herd that Joon was takun , he wente in to Galilee .
40004013	And he lefte the citee of Nazareth , and cam , and dwelte in the citee of Cafarnaum , biside the see , in the coostis of Zabulon and Neptalym ,
40004014	that it shulde be fulfillid , that was seid by Ysaie , the profete , seiynge ,
40004015	The lond of Sabulon and the lond of Neptalym , the weie of the see ouer Jordan , of Galilee of hethen men ,
40004016	the puple that walkide in derknessis saye greet liyt , and while men satten in the cuntre of shadewe of deth , liyt aroos to hem .
40004017	Fro that tyme Jhesus bigan to preche , and seie , Do ye penaunce , for the kyngdom of heuenes schal come niy .
40004018	And Jhesus walkide bisidis the see of Galilee , and saye twei britheren , Symount , that is clepid Petre , and Andrewe , his brothir , castynge nettis in to the see ; for thei weren fischeris .
40004019	And he seide to hem , Come ye aftir me , and Y shal make you to be maad fisscheris of men .
40004020	And anoon thei leften the nettis , and sueden hym .
40004021	And he yede forth fro that place , and saie tweyne othere britheren , James of Zebede , and Joon , his brother , in a schip with Zebede , her fadir , amendynge her nettis , and he clepide hem .
40004022	And anoon thei leften the nettis and the fadir , and sueden hym .
40004023	And Jhesus yede aboute al Galilee , techynge in the synagogis of hem , and prechynge the gospel of the kyngdom , and heelynge euery languor and eche sekenesse among the puple .
40004024	And his fame wente in to al Sirie ; and thei brouyten to hym alle that weren at male ese , and that weren take with dyuerse languores and turmentis , and hem that hadden feendis , and lunatike men , and men in palesy , and he heelide hem .
40004025	And ther sueden hym myche puple of Galile , and of Decapoli , and of Jerusalem , and of Judee , and of biyende Jordan .
40005001	And Jhesus , seynge the puple , wente vp in to an hil ; and whanne he was set , hise disciplis camen to hym .
40005002	And he openyde his mouth , and tauyte hem , and seide ,
40005003	Blessed ben pore men in spirit , for the kyngdom of heuenes is herne .
40005004	Blessid ben mylde men , for thei schulen welde the erthe .
40005005	Blessid ben thei that mornen , for thei schulen be coumfortid .
40005006	Blessid ben thei that hungren and thristen riytwisnesse , for thei schulen be fulfillid .
40005007	Blessid ben merciful men , for thei schulen gete merci .
40005008	Blessid ben thei that ben of clene herte , for thei schulen se God .
40005009	Blessid ben pesible men , for thei schulen be clepid Goddis children .
40005010	Blessid ben thei that suffren persecusioun for riytfulnesse , for the kingdam of heuenes is herne .
40005011	` Ye schulen be blessid , whanne men schulen curse you , and schulen pursue you , and shulen seie al yuel ayens you liynge , for me .
40005012	Ioie ye , and be ye glad , for youre meede is plenteuouse in heuenes ; for so thei han pursued ` also profetis that weren bifor you .
40005013	Ye ben salt of the erthe ; that if the salt vanysche awey , whereynne schal it be saltid ? To no thing it is worth ouere , no but that it be cast out , and be defoulid of men .
40005014	Ye ben liyt of the world ; a citee set on an hil may not be hid ;
40005015	ne me teendith not a lanterne , and puttith it vndur a busschel , but on a candilstike , that it yyue liyt to alle that ben in the hous .
40005016	So schyne youre liyt befor men , that thei se youre goode werkis , and glorifie youre fadir that is in heuenes .
40005017	Nil ye deme , that Y cam to vndo the lawe , or the profetis ; Y cam not to vndo the lawe , but to fulfille .
40005018	Forsothe Y seie to you , til heuene and erthe passe , o lettir or o titel shal not passe fro the lawe , til alle thingis be doon .
40005019	Therfor he that brekith oon of these leeste maundementis , and techith thus men , schal be clepid the leste in the rewme of heuenes ; ` but he that doith , and techith , schal be clepid greet in the kyngdom of heuenes .
40005020	And Y seie to you , that but your riytfulnesse be more plenteuouse than of scribis and of Farisees , ye schulen not entre into the kyngdom of heuenes .
40005021	Ye han herd that it was seid to elde men , Thou schalt not slee ; and he that sleeth , schal be gilti to doom .
40005022	But Y seie to you , that ech man that is wrooth to his brothir , schal be gilti to doom ; and he that seith to his brother , Fy ! schal be gilti to the counseil ; but he that seith , Fool , schal be gilti to the fier of helle .
40005023	Therfor if thou offrist thi yifte ` at the auter , and ther thou bithenkist , that thi brothir hath sum what ayens thee ,
40005024	leeue there thi yifte bifor the auter , and go first to be recounselid to thi brothir , and thanne thou schalt come , and schalt offre thi yifte .
40005025	Be thou consentynge to thin aduersarie soone , while thou art in the weie with hym , lest perauenture thin aduersarie take thee to the domesman , and the domesman take thee to the mynystre , and thou be sent in to prisoun .
40005026	Treuli Y seie to thee , thou shalt not go out fro thennus , til thou yelde the last ferthing .
40005027	Ye han herd that it was seid to elde men , Thou schalt ` do no letcherie .
40005028	But Y seie to you , that euery man that seeth a womman for to coueite hir , hath now do letcherie bi hir in his herte .
40005029	That if thi riyt iye sclaundre thee , pulle hym out , and caste fro thee ; for it spedith to thee , that oon of thi membris perische , than that al thi bodi go in to helle .
40005030	And if thi riyt hond sclaundre thee , kitte hym aweye , and caste fro thee ; for it spedith to thee that oon of thi membris perische , than that al thi bodi go in to helle .
40005031	And it hath be seyd , Who euere leeueth his wijf , yyue he to hir a libel of forsakyng .
40005032	But Y seie to you , that euery man that leeueth his wijf , outtakun cause of fornycacioun , makith hir to do letcherie , and he that weddith the forsakun wijf , doith auowtrye .
40005033	Eftsoone ye han herd , that it was seid to elde men , Thou schalt not forswere , but thou schalt yelde thin othis to the Lord .
40005034	But Y seie to you , that ye swere not ` for ony thing ; nethir bi heuene , for it is the trone of God ;
40005035	nether bi the erthe , for it is the stole of his feet ; nether bi Jerusalem , for it is the citee of a greet kyng ; nether thou shalt not swere bi thin heed ,
40005036	for thou maist not make oon heere white , ne blacke ;
40005037	but be youre word , Yhe , yhe ; Nay , nay ; and that that is more than these , is of yuel .
40005038	Ye han herd that it hath be seid , Iye for iye , and tothe for tothe .
40005039	But Y seie to you , that ye ayenstonde not an yuel man ; but if ony smyte thee in the riyt cheke , schewe to him also the tothir ;
40005040	and to hym that wole stryue with thee in doom , and take awey thi coote , leeue thou ` to him also thi mantil ;
40005041	and who euer constreyneth thee a thousynde pacis , go thou with hym othir tweyne .
40005042	Yyue thou to hym that axith of thee , and turne not awey fro hym that wole borewe of thee .
40005043	Ye han herd that it was seid , Thou shalt loue thi neiybore , and hate thin enemye .
40005044	But Y seie to you , loue ye youre enemyes , do ye wel to hem that hatiden you , and preye ye for hem that pursuen , and sclaundren you ;
40005045	that ye be the sones of your fadir that is in heuenes , that makith his sunne to rise vpon goode ` and yuele men , and reyneth on iust men and vniuste .
40005046	For if ye louen hem that louen you , what mede schulen ye han ? whether pupplicans doon not this ?
40005047	And if ye greten youre britheren oonli , what schulen ye do more ? ne doon not hethene men this ?
40005048	Therfore be ye parfit , as youre heuenli fadir is parfit .
40006001	Takith hede , that ye do not youre riytwisnesse bifor men , to be seyn of hem , ellis ye schulen haue no meede at youre fadir that is in heuenes .
40006002	Therfore whanne thou doist almes , nyle thou trumpe tofore thee , as ypocritis doon in synagogis and stretis , that thei be worschipid of men ; sotheli Y seie to you , they han resseyued her meede .
40006003	But whanne thou doist almes , knowe not thi left hond what thi riyt hond doith , that thin almes be in hidils ,
40006004	and thi fadir that seeth in hiddils , schal quyte thee .
40006005	And whanne ye preyen , ye schulen not be as ipocritis , that louen to preye stondynge in synagogis and corneris of stretis , to be seyn of men ; treuli Y seie to you , thei han resseyued her meede .
40006006	But whanne thou schalt preye , entre in to thi couche , and whanne the dore is schet , preye thi fadir in hidils , and thi fadir that seeth in hidils , schal yelde to thee .
40006007	But in preiyng nyle yee speke myche , as hethene men doon , for thei gessen that thei ben herd in her myche speche .
40006008	Therfor nyle ye be maad lich to hem , for your fadir woot what is nede to you , bifore that ye axen hym .
40006009	And thus ye schulen preye , Oure fadir that art in heuenes , halewid be thi name ;
40006010	thi kyngdoom come to ; be thi wille don ` in erthe as in heuene ;
40006011	yyue to vs this dai oure ` breed ouer othir substaunce ;
40006012	and foryyue to vs oure dettis , as we foryyuen to oure dettouris ; and lede vs not in to temptacioun ,
40006013	but delyuere vs fro yuel .
40006014	Amen . For if ye foryyuen to men her synnes , youre heuenli fadir schal foryyue to you youre trespassis .
40006015	Sotheli if ye foryyuen not to men , nether youre fadir schal foryyue to you youre synnes .
40006016	But whanne ye fasten , nyle ye be maad as ypocritis sorewful , for thei defacen hem silf , to seme fastyng to men ; treuli Y seie to you , they han resseyued her meede .
40006017	But whanne thou fastist , anoynte thin heed , and waische thi face ,
40006018	that thou be not seen fastynge to men , but to thi fadir that is in hidlis , and thi fadir that seeth in priuey , shal yelde to thee .
40006019	Nile ye tresoure to you tresouris in erthe , where ruste and mouyte destrieth , and where theues deluen out and stelen ;
40006020	but gadere to you tresouris in heuene , where nether ruste ne mouyte distrieth , and where theues deluen not out , ne stelen .
40006021	For where thi tresoure is , there also thin herte is .
40006022	The lanterne of thi bodi is thin iye ; if thin iye be symple , al thi bodi shal be liytful ;
40006023	but if thin iye be weiward , al thi bodi shal be derk . If thanne the liyt that is in thee be derknessis , how grete schulen thilk derknessis be ?
40006024	No man may serue tweyn lordis , for ethir he schal hate ` the toon , and loue the tother ; ethir he shal susteyne ` the toon , and dispise the tothir . Ye moun not serue God and richessis .
40006025	Therfor I seie to you , that ye be not bisi to youre lijf , what ye schulen ete ; nether to youre bodi , with what ye schulen be clothid . Whether lijf is not more than meete , and the bodie more than cloth ?
40006026	Biholde ye the foulis of the eire , for thei sowen not , nethir repen , nethir gaderen in to bernes ; and youre fadir of heuene fedith hem . Whether ye ben not more worthi than thei ?
40006027	But who of you thenkynge mai putte to his stature o cubit ?
40006028	And of clothing what ben ye bisye ? Biholde ye the lilies of the feeld , how thei wexen . Thei trauelen not , nether spynnen ;
40006029	and Y seie to you , Salomon in al his glorie was not keuered as oon of these .
40006030	And if God clothith thus the hei of the feeld , that to day is , and to morewe is cast in to an ouen , hou myche more you of litel feith ?
40006031	Therfor nyle ye be bisi , seiynge , What schulen we ete ? or , What schulen we drinke ? or , With what thing schulen we be keuered ?
40006032	For hethene men seken alle these thingis ; and youre fadir woot , that ye han nede to alle these thingis .
40006033	Therfor seke ye first the kyngdom of God , and his riytfulnesse , and alle these thingis shulen be cast to you .
40006034	Therfor nyle ye be bisy in to the morew , for the morew shal be bisi to ` hym silf ; for it suffisith to the dai his owen malice .
40007001	Nile ye deme , ` that ye be not demed ; for in what doom ye demen ,
40007002	ye schulen be demed , and in what mesure ye meten , it schal be meten ayen to you .
40007003	But what seest thou a litil mote in the iye of thi brother , and seest not a beem in thin owne iye ?
40007004	Or hou seist thou to thi brothir , Brothir , suffre I schal do out a mote fro thin iye , and lo ! a beem is in thin owne iye ?
40007005	Ipocrite , ` do thou out first the beem of thin iye , and thanne thou schalt se to do out the mote of the iye of thi brothir .
40007006	Nile ye yyue hooli thing to houndis , nethir caste ye youre margaritis bifore swyne , lest perauenture thei defoulen hem with her feet , and the houndis be turned , and al to-tere you .
40007007	Axe ye , and it schal be youun to you ; seke ye , and ye schulen fynde ; knocke ye , and it schal be openyd to you .
40007008	For ech that axith , takith ; and he that sekith , fyndith ; and it schal be openyd to hym , that knockith .
40007009	What man of you is , that if his sone axe hym breed , whethir he wole take hym a stoon ?
40007010	Or if he axe fische , whether he wole take hym an edder ?
40007011	Therfor if ye , whanne ye ben yuele men , kunnen yyue good yiftis to youre sones , hou myche more youre fadir that is in heuenes schal yyue good thingis to men that axen hym ?
40007012	Therfor alle thingis , what euere thingis ye wolen that men do to you , do ye to hem , for this is the lawe and the prophetis .
40007013	Entre ye bi the streyt yate ; for the yate that ledith to perdicioun is large , and the weie is broode , and there ben many that entren bi it .
40007014	Hou streit is the yate , and narwy the weye , that ledith to lijf , and ther ben fewe that fynden it .
40007015	Be ye war of fals prophetis , that comen to you in clothingis of scheep , but withynneforth thei ben as wolues of raueyn ;
40007016	of her fruytis ye schulen knowe hem . Whether men gaderen grapis of thornes , or figus of breris ?
40007017	So euery good tre makith good fruytis ; but an yuel tre makith yuel fruytis .
40007018	A good tre may not make yuel fruytis , nethir an yuel tre make good fruytis .
40007019	Euery tre that makith not good fruyt , schal be kyt doun , and schal be cast in to the fier .
40007020	Therfor of her fruytis ye schulen knowe hem .
40007021	Not ech man that seith to me , Lord , Lord , schal entre in to the kyngdom of heuenes ; but he that doith the wille of my fadir that is in heuenes , he schal entre in to the kyngdoom of heuenes .
40007022	Many schulen seie to me in that dai , Lord , Lord , whether we han not prophesied in thi name , and han caste out feendis in thi name , and han doon many vertues in thi name ?
40007023	And thanne Y schal knouleche to hem , That Y knewe you neuere ; departe awei fro me , ye that worchen wickidnesse .
40007024	Therfor ech man that herith these my wordis , and doith hem , schal be maad lijk to a wise man , that hath bildid his hous on a stoon .
40007025	And reyn felde doun , and flodis camen , and wyndis blewen , and russchiden ` in to that hous ; and it felde not doun , for it was foundun on a stoon .
40007026	And euery man that herith these my wordis , and doith hem not , is lijk to a fool , that hath bildid his hous on grauel .
40007027	And reyn cam doun , and floodis camen , and wyndis blewen , and thei hurliden ayen that hous ; and it felde doun , and the fallyng doun therof was greet .
40007028	And it was doon , whanne Jhesus hadde endid these wordis , the puple wondride on his techyng ;
40007029	for he tauyte hem , as he that hadde power , and not as the scribis ` of hem , and the Farisees .
40008001	But whanne Jhesus was come doun fro the hil , mych puple suede hym .
40008002	And loo ! a leprouse man cam , and worschipide hym , and seide , Lord , if thou wolt , thou maist make me clene .
40008003	And Jhesus helde forth the hoond , and touchide hym , and seide , Y wole , be thou maad cleene . And anoon the lepre of him was clensid .
40008004	And Jhesus seide to hym , Se , seie thou to no man ; but go , shewe thee to the prestis , and offre the yift that Moyses comaundide , in witnessyng to hem .
40008005	And whanne he hadde entrid in to Cafarnaum , ` the centurien neiyede to him , and preiede him ,
40008006	and seide , Lord , my childe lijth in the hous sijk on the palesie , and is yuel turmentid .
40008007	And Jhesus seide to him , Y schal come , and schal heele him .
40008008	And the centurien answeride , and seide to hym , Lord , Y am not worthi , that thou entre vndur my roof ; but oonli seie thou bi word , and my childe shal be heelid .
40008009	For whi Y am a man ordeyned vndur power , and haue knyytis vndir me ; and Y seie to this , Go , and he goith ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my seruaunt , Do this , and he doith it .
40008010	And Jhesus herde these thingis , and wondride , and seide to men ` that sueden him , Treuli Y seie to you , Y foond not so greet feith in Israel .
40008011	And Y seie to you , that many schulen come fro the eest and the west , and schulen reste with Abraham and Ysaac and Jacob in the kyngdom of heuenes ;
40008012	but the sones of the rewme schulen be cast out in to vtmer derknessis ; there schal be wepyng , and grynting of teeth .
40008013	And Jhesus seide to the centurioun , Go , and as thou hast bileuyd , be it doon to thee . And the child was heelid fro that hour .
40008014	And whanne Jhesus was comun in to the hous of Symount Petre , he say his wyues modir liggynge , and shakun with feueris .
40008015	And he touchide hir hoond , and the feuer lefte hir ; and she roos , and seruede hem .
40008016	And whanne it was euen , thei brouyten to hym manye that hadden deuelis , and he castide out spiritis bi word , and heelide alle that weren yuel at ese ;
40008017	that it were fulfillid , that was seid by Ysaie , the profete , seiynge , He took oure infirmytees , and bar oure siknessis .
40008018	And Jhesus say myche puple aboute him , and bade hise disciplis go ouer the watir .
40008019	And a scribe neiyede , and seide to hym , Maistir , Y shal sue thee , whidir euer thou schalt go .
40008020	And Jhesus seide to hym , Foxis han dennes , and briddis of heuene han nestis , but mannus sone hath not where ` he schal reste his heed .
40008021	Anothir of his disciplis seide to him , Lord , suffre me to go first , and birie my fader .
40008022	But Jhesus seide to hym , Sue thou me , and lete deed men birie her deede men .
40008023	And whanne he was goon vp in to a litil schip , his disciplis sueden hym .
40008024	And loo ! a greet stiring was maad in the see , so that the schip was hilid with wawes ; but he slepte .
40008025	And hise disciplis camen to hym , and reysiden hym , and seiden , Lord , saue vs ; we perischen .
40008026	And Jhesus seide to hem , What ben ye of litil feith agaste ? Thanne he roos , and comaundide to the wyndis and the see , and a greet pesibilnesse was maad .
40008027	And men wondriden , and seiden , What maner man is he this , for the wyndis and the see obeischen to him ?
40008028	And whanne Jhesus was comun ouer the watir in to the cuntre of men of Gerasa , twey men metten hym , that hadden deuelis , and camen out of graues , ful woode , so that noo man myyte go bi that weie .
40008029	And lo ! thei crieden , and seiden , What to vs and to thee , Jhesu , the sone of God ? ` art thou comun hidir bifore the tyme to turmente vs ?
40008030	And not fer fro hem was a flocke of many swyne lesewynge .
40008031	And the deuelis preyeden hym , and seiden , If thou castist out vs fro hennes , sende vs in to the droue of swyne .
40008032	And he seide to hem , Go ye . And thei yeden out , and wenten in to the swyne ; and loo ! in a greet bire al the droue wente heedlyng in to the see , and thei weren deed in the watris .
40008033	And the hirdis fledden awey , and camen in to the citee , and telden alle these thingis , and of hem that hadden the feendis .
40008034	And lo ! al the citee wente out ayens Jhesu ; and whanne thei hadden seyn hym , thei preieden , that he wolde passe fro her coostis .
40009001	And Jhesus wente vp in to a boot , and passide ouer the watir , and cam in to his citee .
40009002	And lo ! thei brouyten to hym a man sike in palesie , liggynge in a bed . And Jhesus saw the feith of hem , and seide to the man sike in palesye , Sone , haue thou trist ; thi synnes ben foryouun to thee .
40009003	And lo ! summe of the scribis seiden withynne hem silf , This blasfemeth .
40009004	And whanne Jhesus hadde seyn her thouytis , he seide , Wherto thenken ye yuele thingis in youre hertis ?
40009005	What is liytere to seye , Thi synnes ben foryouun to thee , ethir ` to seie , Rise thou , and walke ?
40009006	But that ye wite that mannus sone hath power to foryyue synnes in erthe , thanne he seide to the sijk man in palesie , Rise vp ; take thi bed , and go in to thin hous .
40009007	And he roos , and wente in to his hous .
40009008	And the puple seynge dredde , and glorifiede God , that yaf suche power to men .
40009009	And whanne Jhesus passide fro thennus , he say a man , Matheu bi name , sittynge in a tolbothe . And he seide to hym , Sue thou me .
40009010	And he roos , and folewide hym . And it was don , the while he sat ` at the mete in the hous , lo ! many pupplicans and synful men camen , and saten ` at the mete with Jhesu and hise disciplis .
40009011	And Farisees sien , and seiden to hise disciplis , Whi etith youre maister with pupplicans and synful men ?
40009012	And Jhesus herde , and seide , A leche is not nedeful to men that faren wel , but to men that ben yuel at ese .
40009013	But go ye , and lerne what it is , Y wole merci , and not sacrifice ; for I cam , not to clepe riytful men , but synful men .
40009014	Thanne the disciplis of Joon camen to hym , and seiden , Whi we and Farisees fasten ofte , but thi disciplis fasten not ?
40009015	And Jhesus seide to hem , Whether the sones of the spouse moun morne , as long as the spouse is with hem ? But daies schulen come , whanne the spouse schal be takun a wei fro hem , and thanne thei schulen faste .
40009016	And no man putteth a clout of buystous clothe in to an elde clothing ; for it doith awey the fulnesse of the cloth , and a wers breking is maad .
40009017	Nethir men putten newe wyne in to elde botelis , ellis the botels ben to-broke , and distried , and the wyn sched out . But men putten newe wyne in to newe botels , and bothe ben kept .
40009018	Whiles that Jhesus spak thes thingis to hem , lo ! a prince cam , and worschipide hym , and seide , Lord , my douyter is now deed ; but come thou , and putte thin hond on hir , and she schal lyue .
40009019	And Jhesus roos , and ` hise disciplis , and sueden hym .
40009020	And lo ! a womman , that hadde the blodi flux twelue yere , neiyede bihynde , and touchide the hem of his cloth .
40009021	For sche seide with ynne hir self , Yif Y touche oonli the cloth of hym , Y schal be saaf .
40009022	And Jhesus turnede , and say hir , and seide , Douytir , haue thou trist ; thi feith hath maad thee saaf . And the womman was hool fro that our .
40009023	And whanne Jhesus cam in to the hous of the prince , and say mynstrallis , and the puple makynge noise ,
40009024	he seide , Go ye a wei , for the damysel is not deed , but slepith . And thei scornyden hym .
40009025	And whanne the folc was put out , he wente in , and helde hir hond ; and the damysel roos .
40009026	And this fame wente out in to al that loond .
40009027	And whanne Jhesus passide fro thennus , twei blynde men criynge sueden hym , and seiden , Thou sone of Dauid , haue merci on vs .
40009028	And whanne he cam in to the hous , the blynde men camen to hym ; and Jhesus seide to hem , What wolen ye , that I do to you ? And thei seiden , Lord , that oure iyen be opened . And Jhesus seide , Bileuen ye , that Y mai do this thing to you ? Thei seien to him , Yhe , Lord .
40009029	Thanne he touchide her iyen , and seide , Aftir youre feith be it doon to you .
40009030	And the iyen of hem were opened . And Jhesus thretenede hem , and seide , Se ye , that no man wite .
40009031	But thei yeden out , and diffameden hym thorou al that lond .
40009032	And whanne thei weren gon out , loo ! thei brouyten to hym a doumbe man , hauynge a deuel .
40009033	And whanne the deuel was cast out , the doumb man spak . And the puple wondride , and seide , It hath not be say thus in Israel .
40009034	But the Farisees seiden , In the prince of deuelis he castith out deuelis .
40009035	And Jhesus wente ` aboute alle the ` citees and castels , techinge in the synagogis of hem , and prechynge the gospel of the kyngdom , and helynge euery langour and euery sijknesse .
40009036	And he siy the puple , and hadde reuthe on hem ; for thei weren trauelid , and liggynge as scheep not hauynge a scheepherde .
40009037	Thanne he seide to hise disciplis , Sotheli there is myche ripe corn , but fewe werk men .
40009038	Therfor preye ye the lord of the ripe corn , that he sende werke men in to his ripe corn .
40010001	And whanne his twelue disciplis weren clepid togidere , he yaf to hem powere of vnclene spiritis , to caste hem out of men , and to heele eueri langour , and sijknesse .
40010002	And these ben the names of the twelue apostlis ; the firste , Symount , that is clepid Petre , and Andrew , his brothir ; James of Zebede , and Joon , his brothir ; Filip , and Bartholomeu ;
40010003	Thomas , and Matheu , pupplican ; and James Alfey , and Tadee ;
40010004	Symount Chananee , and Judas Scarioth , that bitrayede Crist .
40010005	Jhesus sente these twelue , and comaundide hem , and seide , Go ye not ` in to the weie of hethene men , and entre ye not in to the citees of Samaritans ;
40010006	but rather go ye to the scheep of the hous of Israel , that han perischid .
40010007	And go ye , and preche ye , and seie , that the kyngdam of heuenes shal neiye ;
40010008	heele ye sike men , reise ye deede men , clense ye mesels , caste ye out deuelis ; freeli ye han takun , freli yyue ye .
40010009	Nyle ye welde gold , nether siluer , ne money in youre girdlis , not a scrippe in the weie ,
40010010	nether twei cootis , nethir shoon , nether a yerde ; for a werkman is worthi his mete .
40010011	In to what euere citee or castel ye schulen entre , axe ye who therynne is worthi , and there dwelle ye , til ye go out .
40010012	And whanne ye goon in to an hous , ` grete ye it , and seyn , Pees to this hous .
40010013	And if thilk hous be worthi , youre pees schal come on it ; but if that hous be not worthi , youre pees schal turne ayen to you .
40010014	And who euere resseyueth not you , nethir herith youre wordis , go ye fro that hous or citee , and sprenge of the dust of youre feet .
40010015	Treuly Y seie to you , it shal be more suffrable to the loond of men of Sodom and of Gommor in the dai of iugement , than to thilke citee .
40010016	Lo ! Y sende you as scheep in the myddil of wolues ; therfor be ye sliy as serpentis , and symple as dowues .
40010017	But be ye war of men , for thei schulen take you in counseilis , and thei schulen bete you in her synagogis ;
40010018	and to meyris , or presidentis , and to kyngis , ye schulen be lad for me , in witnessyng to hem , and to the hethen men .
40010019	But whanne thei take you , nyle ye thenke , hou or what thing ye schulen speke , for it shal be youun ` to you in that our , what ye schulen speke ;
40010020	for it ben not ye that speken , but the spirit of youre fadir , that spekith in you .
40010021	` And the brother shal take the brother in to deeth , and the fader the sone , and sones schulen rise ayens fadir and modir , and schulen turmente hem bi deeth .
40010022	And ye schulen be in hate to alle men for my name ; but he that shall dwelle stille in to the ende , shal be saaf .
40010023	And whanne thei pursuen you in this citee , fle ye in to anothir . Treuli Y seie to you , ye schulen not ende the citees of Israel , to for that mannus sone come .
40010024	The disciple is not aboue the maistir , ne the seruaunt aboue hys lord ;
40010025	it is ynowy to the disciple , that he be as his maistir , and to the seruaunt as his lord . If thei han clepid the hosebonde man Belsabub , hou myche more his houshold meyne ?
40010026	Therfor drede ye not hem ; for no thing is hid , that schal not be shewid ; and no thing is priuey , that schal not be wist .
40010027	That thing that Y seie to you in derknessis , seie ye in the liyt ; and preche ye on housis , that thing that ye heeren in the ere .
40010028	And nyle ye drede hem that sleen the bodi ; for thei moun not sle the soule ; but rather drede ye hym , that mai lese bothe soule and bodi in to helle .
40010029	Whether twei sparewis ben not seeld for an halpeny ? and oon of hem shal not falle on the erthe with outen youre fadir .
40010030	` And alle the heeris of youre heed ben noumbrid .
40010031	Therfor nyle ye drede ; ye ben betere than many sparewis .
40010032	Therfor euery man that schal knouleche me bifore men , Y schal knouleche hym bifor my fadir that is in heuenes .
40010033	But he that shal denye me bifor men , and I shal denye him bifor my fadir that is in heuenes .
40010034	Nile ye deme , that Y cam to sende pees in to erthe ; Y cam not to sende pees , but swerd .
40010035	For Y cam to departe a man ayens his fadir , and the douytir ayens hir modir , and the sones wijf ayens the housbondis modir ;
40010036	and the enemyes of a man ben ` thei , that ben homeli with him .
40010037	He that loueth fadir or modir more than me , is not worthi to me . And he that loueth sone or douyter ouer me , is not worthi to me .
40010038	And he that takith not his croos , and sueth me , is not worthi to me .
40010039	He that fyndith his lijf , shal lose it ; and he that lesith his lijf for me , shal fynde it .
40010040	He that resseyueth you , resseyueth me ; and he that resseyueth me , resseyueth hym that sente me .
40010041	He that resseyueth a prophete in the name of a prophete , shal take the mede of a prophete . And he that resseyueth a iust man in the name of a iust man , schal take the mede of a iust man .
40010042	And who euer yyueth drynke to oon of these leeste a cuppe of coolde watir oonli in the name of a disciple , treuli Y seie to you , he shal not leese his mede .
40011001	And it was doon , whanne Jhesus hadde endid , he comaundide to hise twelue disciplis , and passide fro thennus to teche and preche in the citees of hem .
40011002	But whanne Joon in boondis hadde herd the werkis of Crist , he sente tweyne of hise disciplis ,
40011003	and seide to him , ` Art thou he that schal come , or we abiden another ?
40011004	And Jhesus answeride , and seide ` to hem , Go ye , and telle ayen to Joon tho thingis that ye han herd and seyn .
40011005	Blynde men seen , crokid men goon , meselis ben maad clene , deefe men heren , deed men rysen ayen , pore men ben takun to ` prechyng of the gospel .
40011006	And he is blessid , that shal not be sclaundrid in me .
40011007	And whanne thei weren goon awei , Jhesus bigan to seie of Joon to the puple , What thing wenten ye out in to desert to se ? a reed wawed with the wynd ?
40011008	Or what thing wenten ye out to see ? a man clothid with softe clothis ? Lo ! thei that ben clothid with softe clothis ben in the housis of kyngis .
40011009	But what thing wenten ye out to se ? a prophete ? Yhe , Y seie to you , and more than a prophete .
40011010	For this is he , of whom it is writun , Lo ! Y sende myn aungel bifor thi face , that shal make redi thi weye bifor thee .
40011011	Treuli Y seie to you , ther roos noon more than Joon Baptist among the children of wymmen ; but he that is lesse in the kyngdom of heuenes , is more than he .
40011012	And fro the daies of Joon Baptist til now the kyngdom of heuenes suffrith violence , and violent men rauyschen it .
40011013	For alle prophetis and the lawe ` til to Joon prophecieden ; and if ye wolen resseyue ,
40011014	he is Elie that is to come .
40011015	He that hath eris of heryng , here he .
40011016	But to whom schal Y gesse this generacioun lijk ? It is lijk to children sittynge in chepyng , that crien to her peeris ,
40011017	and seien , We han songun to you , and ye han not daunsid ; we han morned to you , and ye han not weilid .
40011018	For Joon cam nether etynge ne drynkynge , and thei seien , He hath a deuel .
40011019	The sone of man cam etynge and drynkynge , and thei seien , Lo ! a man a glotoun , and a drinkere of wijne , and a freend of pupplicans and of synful men . And wisdom is iustified of her sones .
40011020	Thanne Jhesus bigan to seye repreef to citees , in whiche ful manye vertues of him weren doon , for thei diden not penaunce .
40011021	Wo to thee ! Corosaym , woo to thee ! Bethsaida ; for if the vertues that ben doon in you hadden be doon in Tyre and Sidon , sumtyme thei hadden don penaunce in heyre and aische .
40011022	Netheles Y seie to you , it schal be lesse peyne to Tire and Sidon in the dai of doom , than to you .
40011023	And thou , Cafarnaum , whethir thou schalt be arerid vp in to heuene ? Thou shalt go doun in to helle . For if the vertues that ben don in thee , hadden be don in Sodom , perauenture thei schulden haue dwellid ` in to this dai .
40011024	Netheles Y seie to you , that to the lond of Sodom it schal be ` lesse peyne in the dai of doom , than to thee .
40011025	In thilke tyme Jhesus answeride , and seide , Y knowleche to thee , fadir , lord of heuene and of erthe , for thou hast hid these thingis fro wijse men , and redi , and hast schewid hem to litle children ;
40011026	so , fadir , for so it was plesynge tofore thee .
40011027	Alle thingis ben youune to me of my fadir ; and no man knewe the sone , but the fadir , nethir ony man knewe the fadir , but the sone , and to whom the sone wolde schewe .
40011028	Alle ye that traueilen , and ben chargid , come to me , and Y schal fulfille you .
40011029	Take ye my yok on you , and lerne ye of me , for Y am mylde and meke in herte ; and ye schulen fynde reste to youre soulis .
40011030	` For my yok is softe , and my charge liyt .
40012001	In that tyme Jhesus wente bi cornes in the sabot day ; and hise disciplis hungriden , and bigunnen to plucke the eris of corn , and to ete .
40012002	And Fariseis , seynge , seiden to hym , Lo ! thi disciplis don that thing that is not leueful to hem to do in sabatis .
40012003	And he seide to hem , Whether ye han not red , what Dauid dide , whanne he hungride , and thei that weren with hym ?
40012004	hou he entride in to the hous of God , and eet looues of proposicioun , whiche looues it was not leueful to hym to ete , nether to hem that weren with hym , but to prestis aloone ?
40012005	Or whether ye han not red in the lawe , that in sabotis prestis in the temple defoulen the sabotis , and thei ben with oute blame ?
40012006	And Y seie to you , that here is a gretter than the temple .
40012007	And if ye wisten , what it is , Y wole merci , and not sacrifice , ye schulden neuer haue condempned innocentis .
40012008	For mannus Sone is lord , yhe , of the sabat .
40012009	And whanne he passide fro thennus , he cam in to the synagoge of hem .
40012010	And lo ! a man that hadde a drye hoond . And thei axiden hym , and seiden , Whether it be leueful to hele in the sabot ? that thei schulden acuse hym .
40012011	And he seide to hem , What man of you schal be , that hath o scheep , and if it falle in to a diche in the sabotis , whether he shal not holde , and lifte it vp ?
40012012	How myche more is a man better than a scheep ? Therfor it is leueful to do good in the sabatis .
40012013	Thanne he seide to the man , Stretche forth thin hoond . And he strauyte forth ; and it was restorid to heelthe as the tothir .
40012014	And the Farisees wenten out , and maden a counsel ayens hym , hou thei schulden distrie hym .
40012015	And Jhesus knewe it , and wente awei fro thennus ; and many sueden hym , and he helide hem alle .
40012016	And he comaundide to hem , that thei schulden not make hym knowun ;
40012017	that that thing were fulfillid , that was seid by Isaie , the prophete , seiynge , Lo !
40012018	my child , whom Y haue chosun , my derling , in whom it hath wel plesid to my soule ; Y shal put my spirit on him , and he shal telle dom to hethen men .
40012019	He shal not stryue , ne crye , nethir ony man shal here his voice in stretis .
40012020	A brisid rehed he shal not breke , and he schal not quenche smokynge flax , til he caste out doom to victorie ;
40012021	and hethene men schulen hope in his name .
40012022	Thanne a man blynde and doumbe , that hadde a feend , was brouyt to hym ; and he helide hym , so that he spak , and say .
40012023	And al the puple wondride , and seide , Whether this be the sone of Dauid ?
40012024	But the Farisees herden , and seiden , He this casteth not out feendis , but in Belsabub , prince of feendis .
40012025	And Jhesus , witynge her thouytis , seide to hem , Eche kingdom departid ayens it silf , schal be desolatid , and eche cite , or hous , departid ayens it self , schal not stonde .
40012026	And if Satanas castith out Satanas , he is departid ayens him silf ; therfor hou schal his kingdom stonde ?
40012027	And if Y in Belsabub caste out deuelis , in ` whom youre sones casten out ? Therfor thei schulen be youre domes men .
40012028	But if Y in the Spirit of God caste out feendis , thanne the kyngdom of God is comen in to you .
40012029	Ethir hou may ony man entre in to the hous of a stronge man , and take awey hise vesselis , but ` he first bynde the stronge man , and thanne he schal spuyle his hous ?
40012030	He that is not with me , is ayens me ; and he that gaderith not togidere with me , scaterith abrood .
40012031	Therfor I seie to you , al synne and blasfemye shal be foryouun to men , but ` the spirit of blasfemye shal not be foryouun .
40012032	And who euere seith a word ayens mannus sone , it shal be foryouun to him ; but who that seieth a word ayens the Hooli Goost , it shal not be foryouun to hym , nether in this world , ne in ` the tothir .
40012033	Ethir make ye the tree good , and his fruyt good ; ether make ye the tree yuel and his fruyt yuel ; for a tree is knowun of the fruyt .
40012034	Ye generacioun of eddris , hou moun ye speke goode thingis , whanne ye ben yuele ? For the mouth spekith of plente of the herte .
40012035	A good man bryngith forth good thingis of good tresoure , and an yuel man bringith forth yuel thingis of yuel tresoure .
40012036	And Y seie to you , that of euery idel word , that men speken , thei schulen yelde resoun therof in the dai of doom ;
40012037	for of thi wordis thou schalt be iustified , and of thi wordis thou shalt be dampned .
40012038	Thanne summe of the scribis and Farisees answeriden to hym , and seiden , Mayster , we wolen se a tokne of thee .
40012039	Which answeride , and seide to hem , An yuel kynrede and a spouse brekere sekith a tokene , and a tokene shal not be youun to it , but the tokene of Jonas , the prophete .
40012040	For as Jonas was in the wombe of a whal thre daies and thre nyytis , so mannus sone shal be in the herte of the erthe thre daies and thre nyytis .
40012041	Men of Nynyue schulen rise in doom with this generacioun , and schulen condempne it ; for thei diden penaunce in the prechyng of Jonas , and lo ! here a gretter than Jonas .
40012042	The queene of the south shal rise in doom with this generacioun , and schal condempne it ; for she cam fro the eendis of the erthe to here the wisdom of Salomon , and lo ! here a gretter than Salomon .
40012043	Whanne an vnclene spirit goith out fro a man , he goith bi drie places , ` and sekith rest , and fyndith not .
40012044	Thanne he seith , Y shal turne ayen in to myn hous , fro whannys Y wente out . And he cometh , and fyndith it voide , and clensid with besyms , and maad faire .
40012045	Thanne he goith , and takith with him seuene othere spiritis worse than hym silf ; and thei entren , and dwellen there . And the laste thingis of that man ben maad worse than the formere . So it shal be to this worste generacioun .
40012046	Yit whil he spak to the puple , lo ! his modir and his bretheren stoden withouteforth , sekynge to speke to hym .
40012047	And a man seide to hym , Lo ! thi modir and thi britheren stonden withouteforth , sekynge thee .
40012048	He answeride to the man , that spak to hym , and seide , Who is my modir ? and who ben my britheren ?
40012049	And he helde forth his hoond in to hise disciplis , and seide , Lo ! my modir and my bretheren ;
40012050	for who euer doith the wille of my fadir that is in heuenes , he is my brothir , and sistir , and modir .
40013001	In that dai Jhesus yede out of the hous , and sat bisidis the see .
40013002	And myche puple was gaderid to hym , so that he wente up in to a boot , and sat ; and al the puple stood on the brenke .
40013003	And he spac to hem many thingis in parablis , and seide , Lo ! he that sowith , yede out to sowe his seed .
40013004	And while he sowith , summe seedis felden bisidis the weie , and briddis of the eir camen , and eeten hem .
40013005	But othere seedis felden in to stony places , where thei hadden not myche erthe ; and anoon thei sprongen vp , for thei hadden not depnesse of erthe .
40013006	But whanne the sonne was risun , thei swaliden , and for thei hadden not roote , thei drieden vp .
40013007	And other seedis felden among thornes ; and thornes woxen vp , and strangeleden hem .
40013008	But othere seedis felden in to good lond , and yauen fruyt ; summe an hundrid foold , an othir sixti foold , an othir thritti foold .
40013009	He that hath eris of heryng , here he .
40013010	And the disciplis camen nyy , and seiden to him , Whi spekist thou in parablis to hem ?
40013011	And he answeride , and seide to hem , ` For to you it is youun to knowe the priuytees of the kyngdom of heuenes ; but it is not youun to hem .
40013012	For it shal be youun to hym that hath , and he shal haue plente ; but if a man hath not , also that thing that he hath shal be takun awei fro hym .
40013013	Therfor Y speke to hem in parablis , for thei seynge seen not , and thei herynge heren not , nether vndurstonden ;
40013014	that the prophesie of Ysaie ` seiynge be fulfillid ` in hem , With heryng ye schulen here , and ye shulen not vndurstonde ; and ye seynge schulen se , and ye shulen not se ;
40013015	for the herte of this puple is greetli fattid , and thei herden heuyli with eeris , and thei han closed her iyen , lest sumtime thei seen with iyen , and with eeris heeren , and vndirstonden in herte , and thei be conuertid , and Y heele hem .
40013016	But youre iyen that seen ben blesside , and youre eeris that heren .
40013017	Forsothe Y seie to you , that manye profetis and iust men coueitiden to se tho thingis that ye seen , and thei sayn not , and to heere tho thingis that ye heren , and thei herden not .
40013018	Therfor here ye the parable of the sowere .
40013019	Ech that herith the word of the rewme , and vndirstondith not , the yuel spirit cometh , and rauyschith that that is sowun in his herte ; this it is , that is sowun bisidis the weie .
40013020	But this that is sowun on the stony loond , this it is , that herith the word of God , and anoon with ioye takith it .
40013021	And he hath not roote in hym silf , but is temporal . For whanne tribulacioun and persecucioun is maad for the word , anoon he is sclaundrid .
40013022	But he that is sowun in thornes , is this that heerith the word , and the bisynesse of this world , and the fallace of ritchessis strangulith the word , and it is maad with outen fruyt .
40013023	But he that is sowun in to good loond , is this that herith the word , and vnderstondeth , and bryngith forth fruyt . And summe makith an hundrid fold , treuli anothir sixti fold , and another thritti fold .
40013024	Anothir parable Jhesus puttide forth to hem , and seide , The kyngdom of heuenes is maad lijk to a man , that sewe good seed in his feld .
40013025	And whanne men slepten , his enemy cam , and sewe aboue taris in the myddil of whete , and wente awei .
40013026	But whanne the erbe was growed , and made fruyt , thanne the taris apperiden .
40013027	And the seruauntis of the hosebonde man camen , and seiden to hym , Lord , whether hast thou not sowun good seed in thi feeld ? where of thanne hath it taris ?
40013028	And he seide to hem , An enemy hath do this thing . And the seruauntis seiden to him , ` Wolt thou that we goon , and gaderen hem ?
40013029	And he seide , Nay , lest perauenture ye in gaderynge taris drawen vp with hem the whete bi the roote .
40013030	Suffre ye hem bothe to wexe in to repyng tyme ; and in the tyme of ripe corne Y shal seie to the reperis , First gadere ye to gidere the taris , and bynde hem to gidere in knytchis to be brent , but gadere ye whete in to my berne .
40013031	Another parable Jhesus puttide forth to hem , and seide , The kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to a corn of seneuey , which a man took , and sewe in his feeld .
40013032	Which is the leeste of alle seedis , but whanne it hath woxen , it is the moste of alle wortis , and is maad a tre ; so that briddis of the eir comen , and dwellen in the bowis therof .
40013033	Another parable Jhesus spac to hem , The kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to sour douy , which a womman took , and hidde in thre mesuris of mele , til it were alle sowrid .
40013034	Jhesus spac alle thes thingis in parablis to the puple , and he spac not to hem with out parablis , that it schulde be fulfillid ,
40013035	that is seid bi the prophete , seiynge , Y shal opene my mouth in parablis ; Y shal telle out hid thingis fro the makyng of the world .
40013036	Thanne he lefte the puple , and cam in to an hous ; and hise disciplis camen to him , and seiden , Expowne to vs the parable of taris of the feeld .
40013037	Which answeride , and seide , He that sowith good seed is mannus sone ;
40013038	the feeld is the world ; but the good seed , these ben sones of the kyngdom , but taris , these ben yuele children ;
40013039	the enemye that sowith hem is the feend ; and the ripe corn is the endyng of the world , the reperis ben aungels .
40013040	Therfor as taris ben gaderid togidere , and ben brent in fier , so it shal be in the endyng of the world .
40013041	Mannus sone shal sende hise aungels , and thei schulen gadere fro his rewme alle sclaundris , and hem that doon wickidnesse ;
40013042	and thei schulen sende hem in to the chymney of fier , there shal be weping and betyng to gidere of teeth .
40013043	Thanne iuste men schulen schyne as the sunne , in the rewme of her fadir . He that hath eeris of heryng , here he .
40013044	The kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to tresour hid in a feld , which a man that fyndith , hidith ; and for ioye of it he goith , and sillith alle thingis that he hath , and bieth thilk feeld .
40013045	Eftsoone the kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to a marchaunt , that sechith good margaritis ;
40013046	but whanne he hath foundun o precious margarite , he wente , and selde alle thingis that he hadde , and bouyte it .
40013047	Eft the kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to a nette cast into the see , and that gaderith to gidere of al kynde of fisschis ;
40013048	which whanne it was ful , thei drowen vp , and seten bi the brenke , and chesen the goode in to her vessels , but the yuel thei kesten out .
40013049	So it schal be in the endyng of the world . Aungels schulen go out , and schulen departe yuel men fro the myddil of iuste men .
40013050	And thei shulen sende hem in to the chymnei of fier ; ther shal be weping and gryntyng of teeth .
40013051	Han ye vndirstonde alle these thingis ? Thei seien to hym , Yhe .
40013052	He seith to hem , Therfor euery wise man of lawe in the kyngdom of heuenes , is lijk to an hosebonde man , that bryngith forth of his tresoure newe thingis and elde .
40013053	And it was doon , whanne Jhesus hadde endid these parablis , he passide fro thennus .
40013054	And he cam in to his cuntrei , and tauyte hem in her synagogis , so that thei wondriden , and seiden , Fro whennus this wisdam and vertues camen to this ?
40013055	Whether ` is not this the sone of a carpentere ? Whether his modir be not seid Marie ? and hise britheren , James , and Joseph , and Symount , and Judas ? and hise sistris ,
40013056	whether thei alle ben not among us ? Fro whennus thanne ` alle thes thingis camen to this ?
40013057	And so thei weren sclaundrid in hym . But Jhesus seide to hem , A profete is not with oute worschip , but in his owen cuntre , and in his owen hous .
40013058	And he dide not there manye vertues , for the vnbileue of hem .
40014001	In that tyme Eroude tetrarke , prynce of the fourthe part , herde the fame of Jhesu ;
40014002	and seide to hise children , This is Joon Baptist , he is rysun fro deeth , and therfor vertues worchen in hym .
40014003	For Heroude hadde holde Joon , and bounde hym , and puttide hym ` in to prisoun for Herodias , the wijf of his brothir .
40014004	For Joon seide to him , It is not leueful to thee to haue hir .
40014005	And he willynge to sle hym , dredde the puple ; for thei hadden hym as a prophete .
40014006	But in the dai of Heroudis birthe , the douytir of Herodias daunside in the myddil , and pleside Heroude .
40014007	Wherfor with an ooth he bihiyte to yyue to hir , what euere thing she hadde axid of hym .
40014008	And she bifor warned of hir modir , seide , Yif thou to me here the heed of Joon Baptist in a disch .
40014009	And the kyng was sorewful , but for the ooth , and for hem that saten to gidere at the mete , he comaundide to be youun .
40014010	And he sente , and bihedide Joon in the prisoun .
40014011	And his heed was brouyt in a dische , and it was youun to the damysel , and she bar it to hir modir .
40014012	And hise disciplis camen , and token his bodi , and birieden it ; and thei camen , and tolden to Jhesu .
40014013	And whanne Jhesus hadde herd this thing , he wente fro thennus in a boot , in to desert place bisides . And whanne the puple hadde herd , thei folewiden hym on her feet fro citees .
40014014	And Jhesus yede out , and sai a greet puple , and hadde reuthe on hem , and heelide the sike men of hem .
40014015	But whanne the euentid was com , hise disciplis camen to him , and seiden , The place is desert , and the tyme is now passid ; lat the puple go in to townes , to bye hem mete .
40014016	Jhesus seide to hem , Thei han not nede to go ; yyue ye hem sumwhat to ete .
40014017	Thei answeriden , We han not heere , but fyue looues and twei fischis .
40014018	And he seide to hem , Brynge ye hem hidur to me .
40014019	And whanne he hadde comaundid the puple to sitte to meete on the heye , he took fyue looues and twei fischis , and he bihelde in to heuene , and blesside , and brak , and yaf to hise disciplis ; and the disciplis yauen to the puple .
40014020	And alle eten , and weren fulfillid . And thei tooken the relifs of brokun gobetis , twelue cofynes ful .
40014021	And the noumbre of men that eten was fyue thousynde of men , outakun wymmen and lytle children .
40014022	And anoon Jhesus compellide the disciplis to go vp in to a boot , and go bifor hym ouer the see , while he lefte the puple .
40014023	And whanne the puple was left , he stiede aloone in to an hil for to preie . But whanne the euenyng was come , he was there aloone .
40014024	And the boot in the myddel of the see was schoggid with wawis , for the wynd was contrarie to hem .
40014025	But in the fourthe wakyng of the niyt , he cam to hem walkynge aboue the see .
40014026	And thei , seynge hym walking on the see , weren disturblid , and seiden , That it is a fantum ; and for drede thei crieden .
40014027	And anoon Jhesus spac to hem , and seide , Haue ye trust , Y am ; nyle ye drede .
40014028	And Petre answeride , and seide , Lord , if thou art , comaunde me to come to thee on the watris .
40014029	And he seide , Come thou . And Petre yede doun fro the boot , and walkide on the watris to come to Jhesu .
40014030	But he siy the wynd strong , and was aferde ; and whanne he bigan to drenche , he criede , and seide , Lord , make me saaf .
40014031	And anoon Jhesus helde forth his hoond , and took Petre , and seide to hym , Thou of litil feith , whi hast thou doutid ?
40014032	And whanne he hadde stied in to the boot , the wynd ceessid .
40014033	And thei , that weren in the boot , camen , and worschipiden hym , and seiden , Verili , thou art Goddis sone .
40014034	And whanne thei hadden passid ouer the see , thei camen in to the loond of Genesar .
40014035	And whanne men of that place hadden knowe hym , thei senten in to al that cuntre ; and thei brouyten to hym alle that hadden siknesse .
40014036	And thei preieden hym , that thei schulden touche the hemme of his clothing ; and who euere touchiden weren maad saaf .
40015001	Thanne the scribis and the Farisees camen to hym fro Jerusalem , and seiden ,
40015002	Whi breken thi disciplis the tradiciouns of eldere men ? for thei waisschen not her hondis , whanne thei eten breed .
40015003	He answeride , and seide to hem , Whi breken ye the maundement of God for youre tradicioun ?
40015004	For God seide , Honoure thi fadir and thi modir , and he that cursith fadir or modir , die bi deeth .
40015005	But ye seien , Who euer seith to fadir or modir , What euere yifte is of me , it schal profite to thee ;
40015006	and he hath not worschipid his fadir or his modir ; and ye han maad the maundement of God voide for youre tradicioun .
40015007	Ypocritis , Isaie , the prophete , prophesiede wel of you ,
40015008	and seide , This puple honourith me with lippis , but her herte is fer fro me ;
40015009	and thei worschipen me ` with outen cause , techynge the doctrines and maundementis of men .
40015010	And whanne the puple weren clepid to gidere to hym , he seide to hem , Here ye , and ` vndurstonde ye .
40015011	That thing that entrith in to the mouth , defoulith not a man ; but that thing that cometh out of the mouth , defoulith a man .
40015012	Thanne hise disciplis camen , and seiden to hym , Thou knowist , that , if this word be herd , the Farisees ben sclaundrid ?
40015013	And he answeride , and seide , Eueri plauntyng , that my fadir of heuene hath not plauntid , shal be drawun vp by the roote .
40015014	Suffre ye hem ; thei ben blynde , and leederis of blynde men . And if a blynd man lede a blynd man , bothe fallen doun in to the diche .
40015015	Petre answeride , and seide to hym , Expowne to vs this parable .
40015016	And he seide , Yit ` ye ben also with oute vndurstondyng ?
40015017	Vndurstonden ye not , that al thing that entrith in to the mouth , goith in to the wombe , and is sent out in to the goyng awei ?
40015018	But tho thingis that comen forth fro the mouth , goon out of the herte , and tho thingis defoulen a man .
40015019	For of the herte goon out yuele thouytis , mansleyngis , auowtries , fornycaciouns , theftis , fals witnessyngis , blasfemyes .
40015020	Thes thingis it ben that defoulen a man ; but to ete with hondis not waischun , defoulith not a man .
40015021	And Jhesus yede out fro thennus , and wente in to the coostis of Tire and Sidon .
40015022	And lo ! a womman of Canane yede out of tho coostis , and criede , and seide to him , Lord , the sone of Dauid , haue merci on me ; my douyter is yuel traueilid of a feend .
40015023	And he answeride not to hir a word . And hise disciplis camen , and preieden hym , and seiden , Leue thou hir , for she crieth aftir vs .
40015024	He answeride , and seide , Y am not sent , but to the scheep of the hous of Israel that perischiden .
40015025	And she cam , and worschipide hym , and seide , Lord , helpe me .
40015026	Which answeride , and seide , It is not good to take the breed of children , and caste to houndis .
40015027	And she seide , Yhis , Lord ; for whelpis eten of the crummes , that fallen doun fro the bord of her lordis .
40015028	Thanne Jhesus answeride , and seide to hir , A ! womman , thi feith is greet ; be it doon to thee , as thou wolt . And hir douytir was helid fro that hour .
40015029	And whanne Jhesus hadde passed fro thennus , he cam bisidis the see of Galilee . And he yede vp in to an hil , and sat there .
40015030	And myche puple cam to hym , and hadden with hem doumbe men and crokid , feble and blynde , and many other ; and thei castiden doun hem at hise feet . And he helide hem ,
40015031	so that the puple wondriden seynge doumbe men spekynge , and crokid goynge , blynde men seynge ; and thei magnyfieden God of Israel .
40015032	And Jhesus , whanne hise disciplis weren clepid to gidere , seide to hem , Y haue reuthe of the puple , for thei han abiden now thre daies with me , and han no thing to ete ; and Y wole not leeue hem fastynge , lest thei failen in the weie .
40015033	And the disciplis seien to him , Wherof thanne so many looues among vs in desert , to fulfille so greet a puple ?
40015034	And Jhesus seide to hem , Hou many looues han ye ? And thei seiden , Seuene , and a fewe smale fisshis .
40015035	And he comaundide to the puple , to sitte to mete on the erthe .
40015036	And he took seuene looues and fyue fischis , and dide thankyngis , and brak , and yaf to hise disciplis ; and the disciplis yauen to the puple .
40015037	And alle eten , and weren fulfillid , and thei token that that was left of relifes , seuene lepis fulle .
40015038	And thei that eten weren foure thousynde of men , with outen litle children and wymmen .
40015039	And whanne he hadde left the puple , he wente vp in to a boot , and cam in to the coostis of Magedan .
40016001	And the Farisees and the Saducees camen to hym temptynge , and preieden hym to schewe hem a tokene fro heuene .
40016002	And he answeride , and seide to hem , Whanne the euentid is comun , ye seien , It schal be clere , for heuene is rodi ;
40016003	and the morewtid , To dai tempest , for heuene schyneth heueli .
40016004	Thanne ye kunne deme the face of heuene , but ye moun not wite the tokenes of tymes . An yuel generacioun and auoutresse sekith a tokene ; and a tokene schal not be youun to it , but the tokene of Jonas , the profete . And whanne he hadde left hem , he wente forth .
40016005	And whanne his disciplis camen ouer the see , thei foryaten to take looues .
40016006	And he seide to hem , Biholde ye , and be war of the soure dowy of Farisees and Saducees .
40016007	And thei thouyten among hem , and seiden , For we han not take looues .
40016008	But Jhesus witynge seide to hem , What thenken ye among you of litel feith , for ye han not looues ?
40016009	Yit ` vndurstonden not ye , nether han mynde of fyue looues in to fyue thousynde of men , and hou many cofyns ye token ?
40016010	nether of seuene looues in to foure thousynde of men , and hou many lepis ye token ?
40016011	Whi vndurstonden ye not , for Y seide not to you of breed , Be ye war of the sourdowy of Farisees and of Saducees ?
40016012	Thanne thei vndurstooden , that he seide not to be war of sourdowy of looues , but of the techyng of Farisees and Saducees .
40016013	And Jhesus cam in to the parties of Cesarie of Filip , and axide hise disciplis , and seide , Whom seien men to be mannus sone ?
40016014	And thei seiden , Summe Joon Baptist ; othere Elie ; and othere Jeremye , or oon of the prophetis .
40016015	Jhesus seide to hem , But whom seien ye me to be ?
40016016	Symount Petre answeride , and seide , Thou art Crist , the sone of God lyuynge .
40016017	Jhesus answeride , and seide to him , Blessid art thou , Symount Bariona ; for fleisch and blood schewide not to thee , but my fadir that is in heuenes .
40016018	And Y seie to thee , that thou art Petre , and on this stoon Y schal bilde my chirche , and the yatis of helle schulen not haue miyt ayens it .
40016019	And to thee Y shal yyue the keies of the kingdom of heuenes ; and what euer thou shalt bynde on erthe , schal be boundun also in heuenes ; and what euer thou schalt vnbynde on erthe , schal be vnbounden also in heuenes .
40016020	Thanne he comaundide to hise disciplis , that thei schulden seie to no man , that he was Crist .
40016021	Fro that tyme Jhesus bigan to schewe to hise disciplis , that it bihofte hym go to Jerusalem , and suffre many thingis , of the eldere men , and of scribis , and princis of prestis ; and be slayn , and the thridde dai to rise ayen .
40016022	And Petre took hym , and bigan to blame him , and seide , Fer be it fro thee , Lord ; this thing schal not be to thee .
40016023	And he turnede , and seide to Petre , Sathanas , go after me ; thou art a sclaundre to me ; for thou sauerist not tho thingis that ben of God , but tho thingis that ben of men .
40016024	Thanne Jhesus seide to his disciplis , If ony man wole come after me , denye he hym silf , and take his cros , and sue me ; for he that wole make his lijf saaf ,
40016025	shal leese it ; and he that schal leese his lijf for me , schal fynde it .
40016026	For what profitith it to a man , if he wynne al the world , and suffre peiryng of his soule ? or what chaunging schal a man yyue for his soule ?
40016027	For mannes sone schal come in glorie of his fader , with his aungels , and thanne he schal yelde to ech man after his werkis .
40016028	Treuli Y seie to you , ` ther ben summe of hem that stonden here , whiche schulen not taste deth , til thei seen mannus sone comynge in his kyngdom .
40017001	And after sixe daies Jhesus took Petre , and James , and Joon , his brother , and ledde hem aside in to an hiy hil ,
40017002	and was turned in to an othir licnesse bifor hem . And his face schone as the sunne ; and hise clothis weren maad white as snowe .
40017003	And lo ! Moises and Elie apperiden to hem , and spaken with hym .
40017004	And Petre answeride , and seide to Jhesu , Lord , it is good vs to be here . If thou wolt , make we here thre tabernaclis ; to thee oon , to Moises oon , and oon to Elye . Yit the while he spak , lo !
40017005	a briyt cloude ouerschadewide hem ; and lo ! a voice out of the cloude , that seide , This is my dereworth sone , in whom Y haue wel pleside to me ; here ye hym .
40017006	And the disciplis herden , and felden doun on her faces , and dredden greetli .
40017007	And Jhesus cam , and touchide hem , and seide to hem , Rise vp , and nyle ye drede .
40017008	And thei liften vp her iyen , and saien no man , but Jhesu aloone .
40017009	And as thei camen doun of the hille , Jhesus comaundide to hem , and seide , Seie ye to no man the visioun , til mannus sone rise ayen fro deeth .
40017010	And his disciplis axiden hym , and seiden , What thanne seien the scribis , that it bihoueth that Elie come first ?
40017011	He answeride , and seide to hem , Elie schal come , and he schal restore alle thingis .
40017012	And Y seie to you , that Elie is nowe comun , and thei knewen hym not , but thei diden in him what euer thingis thei wolden ; and so mannus sone schal suffre of hem .
40017013	Thanne the disciplis vndurstoden , that he seide to hem of Joon Baptist .
40017014	And whanne he cam to the puple , a man cam to hym , and felde doun on hise knees bifor hym , and seide ,
40017015	Lord , haue merci on my sone ; for he is lunatike , and suffrith yuele , for ofte tymes he fallith in to the fier , and ofte tymes in to water .
40017016	And Y brouyte hym to thi disciplis , and thei myyten not heele hym .
40017017	Jhesus answeride , and seide , A ! thou generacion vnbileueful and weiward ; hou long schal Y be with you ? hou long schal Y suffre you ? Brynge ye hym hider to me .
40017018	And Jhesus blamede hym , and the deuel wente out fro hym ; and the child was heelid fro that our .
40017019	Thanne the disciplis camen to Jhesu priueli , and seiden to hym , Whi myyten not we caste hym out ?
40017020	Jhesus seith to hem , For youre vnbileue . Treuli Y seie to you , if ye han feith , as a corn of seneueye , ye schulen seie to this hil , Passe thou hennus , and it schal passe ; and no thing schal be vnpossible to you ;
40017021	but this kynde is not caste out , but bi preiyng and fastyng .
40017022	And whilis thei weren abidynge togidere in Galilee , Jhesus seide to hem , Mannus sone schal be bitraied in to the hondis of men ;
40017023	and thei schulen sle hym , and the thridde day he schal rise ayen to lijf .
40017024	And thei weren ful sori . And whanne thei camen to Cafarnaum , thei that token tribute , camen to Petre , and seiden to hym , Youre maister payeth not tribute ?
40017025	And he seide , Yhis . And whanne he was comen in to the hous , Jhesus cam bifor hym , and seide , Symount , what semeth to thee ? Kyngis of erthe , of whom taken thei tribute ? of her sones , ether of aliens ?
40017026	And he seide , Of aliens . Jhesus seide to hym , Thanne sones ben fre .
40017027	But that we sclaundre hem not , go to the see , and caste an hook , and take thilke fisch that first cometh vp ; and , whanne his mouth is opened , thou schalt fynde a stater , and yyue for thee and for me .
40018001	In that our the disciplis camen to Jhesu , and seiden , Who , gessist thou , is gretter in the kyngdom of heuenes ?
40018002	And Jhesus clepide a litil child , and putte hym in the myddil of hem ;
40018003	and seide , Y seie treuthe to you , but ye be turned , and maad as litle children , ye schulen not entre in to the kyngdom of heuenes .
40018004	Therfor who euer mekith hym as this litil child , he is gretter in the kyngdom of heuenes .
40018005	And he that resseyueth o siche litil child in my name , resseyueth me .
40018006	But who so sclaundrith oon of these smale , that bileuen in me , it spedith to hym that a mylnstoon ` of assis be hangid in his necke , and he be drenchid in the depnesse of the see .
40018007	Woo to the world , for sclaundris ; for it is nede that sclaundris come ; netheles wo to thilke man bi whom a sclaundre cometh .
40018008	And if thin hoond or thi foot sclaundreth thee , kitte it of , and caste awei fro thee . It is betere to thee to entre to lijf feble , ethir crokid , than hauynge tweyne hoondis or twey feet to be sent in to euerlastynge fier .
40018009	And if thin iye sclaundre thee , pulle it out , and caste awei fro thee . It is betere to thee with oon iye to entre in to lijf , thanne hauynge tweyn iyen to be sent in to the fier of helle .
40018010	Se ye , that ye dispise not oon of these litle . For Y seie to you , that the aungels of hem in heuenes seen euermore the face of my fadir that is in heuenes .
40018011	For mannus sone cam to saue that thing that perischide .
40018012	What semeth to you ? If ther weren to sum man an hundrid scheep , and oon of hem hath errid , whethir he schal not leeue nynti and nyne in desert , and schal go to seche that that erride ?
40018013	And if it falle that he fynde it , treuli Y seie to you , that he schal haue ioye theron more than on nynti and nyne that erriden not .
40018014	So it is not the wille bifor youre fadir that is in heuenes , that oon of these litle perische .
40018015	But if thi brother synneth ayens thee , go thou , and repreue hym , bitwixe thee and hym aloone ; if he herith thee , thou hast wonnun thi brother .
40018016	And if he herith thee not , take with thee oon or tweyne , that euery word stonde in the mouth of tweyne or thre witnessis .
40018017	And if he herith not hem , seie thou to the chirche . But if he herith not the chirche , be he as an hethen and a pupplican to thee .
40018018	Y seie to you treuli , what euer thingis ye bynden on erthe , tho schulen be boundun also in heuene ; and what euer thingis ye vnbynden on erthe , tho schulen be vnboundun also in heuene .
40018019	Eftsoone Y seie to you , that if tweyne of you consenten on the erthe , of euery thing what euer thei axen , it schal be don to hem of my fadir that is in heuenes .
40018020	For where tweyne or thre ben gaderid in my name , there Y am in the myddil of hem .
40018021	Thanne Petre cam to hym , and seide , Lord , how ofte schal my brother synne ayens me , and Y schal foryyue hym ?
40018022	Whether til seuen tymes ? Jhesus seith to hym , Y seie not to thee , til seuene sithis ; but til seuenti sithis seuene sithis .
40018023	Therfor the kyngdom of heuenes is licned to a kyng , that wolde rekyn with hise seruauntis .
40018024	And whanne he bigan to rekene , oon that ouyte ten thousynde talentis , was brouyt to hym .
40018025	And whanne he hadde not wherof to yelde , his lord comaundide hym to be seld , and his wijf , and children , and alle thingis that he hadde , and to be paied .
40018026	But thilke seruaunt felde doun , and preiede hym , and seide , Haue pacience in me , and Y schal yelde to thee alle thingis .
40018027	And the lord hadde merci on that seruaunt , and suffride hym to go , and foryaf to hym the dette .
40018028	But thilke seruaunt yede out , and foonde oon of his euen seruauntis , that ouyte hym an hundrid pens ; and he helde hym , and stranglide hym , and seide , Yelde that that thou owest .
40018029	And his euen seruaunt felle doun , and preyede hym , and seide , Haue pacience in me , and Y schal quyte alle thingis to thee .
40018030	But he wolde not ; but wente out , and putte hym in to prisoun , til he paiede al the dette .
40018031	And hise euen seruauntis , seynge the thingis that weren don , soreweden greetli . And thei camen , and telden to her lord alle the thingis that weren don .
40018032	Thanne his lord clepide hym , and seide to hym , Wickid seruaunt , Y foryaf to thee al the dette , for thou preiedist me .
40018033	Therfor whether it bihouede not also thee to haue merci on thin euen seruaunt , as Y hadde merci on thee ?
40018034	And his lord was wroth , and took hym to turmentouris , til he paiede al the dette .
40018035	So my fadir of heuene schal do to you , if ye foryyuen not euery man to his brother , of youre hertes .
40019001	And it was don , whanne Jhesus hadde endid these wordis , he passide fro Galilee , and cam in to the coostis of Judee ouer Jordan .
40019002	And myche puple suede him , and he heelide hem there .
40019003	And Farisees camen to him , temptynge him , and seiden , Whether it be leueful to a man to leeue his wijf , for ony cause ?
40019004	Which answeride , and seide to hem , Han ye not red , for he that made men at the bigynnyng , made hem male and female ?
40019005	And he seide , For this thing a man schal leeue fadir and modir , and he schal draw to his wijf ; and thei schulen be tweyne in o fleisch .
40019006	And so thei ben not now tweyne , but o fleisch . Therfor a man departe not that thing that God hath ioyned .
40019007	Thei seien to hym , What thanne comaundide Moises , to yyue a libel of forsakyng , and to leeue of ?
40019008	And he seide to hem , For Moises , for the hardnesse of youre herte , suffride you leeue youre wyues ; but fro the bigynnyng it was not so .
40019009	And Y seie to you , that who euer leeueth his wijf , but for fornycacioun , and weddith another , doith letcherie ; and he that weddith the forsakun wijf , doith letcherie .
40019010	His disciplis seien to him , If the cause of a man with a wijf is so , it spedith not to be weddid .
40019011	And he seide to hem , Not alle men taken this word ; but to whiche it is youun .
40019012	For ther ben geldingis , whiche ben thus born of the modris wombe ; and ther ben geldyngis , that ben maad of men ; and there ben geldyngis , that han geldid hem silf , for the kyngdom of heuenes . He that may take , ` take he .
40019013	Thanne litle children weren brouyte to hym , that he schulde putte hondis to hem , and preie .
40019014	And the disciplis blamyden hem . But Jhesus seide to hem , Suffre ye that litle children come to me , and nyle ye forbede hem ; for of siche is the kyngdom of heuenes .
40019015	And whanne he hadde put to hem hondis , he wente fro thennus .
40019016	And lo ! oon cam , and seide to hym , Good maister , what good schal Y do , that Y haue euerlastynge lijf ?
40019017	Which seith to hym , What axist thou me of good thing ? There is o good God . But if thou wolt entre to lijf , kepe the comaundementis .
40019018	He seith to hym , Whiche ? And Jhesus seide , Thou schalt not do mansleying , thou schalt not do auowtrie , thou schalt not do thefte , thou schalt not seie fals witnessying ;
40019019	worschipe thi fadir and thi modir , and , thou schalt loue thi neiybore as thi silf .
40019020	The yonge man seith to hym , Y haue kept alle these thingis fro my youthe , what yit failith to me ?
40019021	Jhesus seith to hym , If thou wolt be perfite , go , and sille alle thingis that thou hast , and yyue to pore men , and thou schalt haue tresoure in heuene ; and come , and sue me .
40019022	And whanne the yong man hadde herd these wordis , he wente awei sorewful , for he hadde many possessiouns .
40019023	And Jhesus seide to hise disciplis , Y seie to you treuthe , for a riche man of hard schal entre in to the kyngdom of heuenes .
40019024	And eftsoone Y seie to you , it is liyter a camel to passe thorou a needlis iye , thanne a riche man to entre in to the kyngdom of heuens .
40019025	Whanne these thingis weren herd , the disciplis wondriden greetli , and seiden , Who thanne may be saaf ?
40019026	Jhesus bihelde , and seide to hem , Anentis men this thing is impossible ; but anentis God alle thingis ben possible .
40019027	Thanne Petre answeride , and seide to hym , Lo ! we han forsake alle thingis , and we han suede thee ; what thanne schal be to vs ?
40019028	Jhesus seide to hem , Truli I seie to you , that ye that han forsake alle thingis , and han sued me , in the regeneracioun whanne mannus sone schal sitte in the sete of his maieste , ye schulen sitte on twelue setis , demynge the twelue kynredis of Israel .
40019029	And euery man that forsakith hous , britheren or sistren , fadir or modir , wijf ethir children , or feeldis , for my name , he schal take an hundrid foold , and schal welde euerlastynge lijf .
40019030	But manye schulen be , the firste the laste , and the laste the firste .
40020001	The kyngdom of heuenes is lijc to an housbonde man , that wente out first bi the morewe , to hire werk men in to his vyneyerd .
40020002	And whanne the couenaunt was maad with werk men , of a peny for the dai , he sente hem in to his vyneyerd .
40020003	And he yede out aboute the thridde our , and say othere stondynge idel in the chepyng .
40020004	And he seide to hem , Go ye also in to myn vynyerd , and that that schal be riytful , Y schal yyue to you .
40020005	And thei wenten forth . Eftsoones he wente out aboute the sixte our , and the nynthe , and dide in lijk maner .
40020006	But aboute the elleuenthe our he wente out , and foond other stondynge ; and he seide to hem , What stonden ye idel here al dai ?
40020007	Thei seien to him , For no man hath hirid vs . He seith to hem , Go ye also in to my vyneyerd .
40020008	And whanne euenyng was comun , the lord of the vyneyerd seith to his procuratoure , Clepe the werk men , and yelde to hem her hire , and bigynne thou at the laste til to the firste .
40020009	And so whanne thei weren comun , that camen aboute the elleuenthe our , also thei token eueryche of hem a peny .
40020010	But the firste camen , and demeden , that thei schulden take more , but thei token ech oon bi hem silf a peny ;
40020011	and in the takyng grutchiden ayens the hosebonde man , and seiden ,
40020012	These laste wrouyten oon our , and thou hast maad hem euen to vs , that han born the charge of the dai , and heete ?
40020013	And he answeride to oon of hem , and seide , Freend , Y do thee noon wrong ; whether thou hast not acordid with me for a peny ?
40020014	Take thou that that is thin , and go ; for Y wole yyue to this laste man , as to thee .
40020015	Whether it is not leueful to me to do that that Y wole ? Whether thin iye is wickid , for Y am good ?
40020016	So the laste schulen be the firste , and the firste the laste ; ` for many ben clepid , but fewe ben chosun .
40020017	And Jhesus wente vp to Jerusalem , and took hise twelue disciplis in priuetee , and seide to hem , Lo !
40020018	we goon vp to Jerusalem , and mannus sone schal be bitakun to princis of prestis , and scribis ; and thei schulen condempne him to deeth .
40020019	And thei schulen bitake hym to hethene men , for to be scorned , and scourgid , and crucified ; and the thridde day he schal rise ayen to lijf .
40020020	Thanne the modir of the sones of Zebedee cam to hym with hir sones , onourynge , and axynge sum thing of hym .
40020021	And he seide to hir , What wolt thou ? She seith to hym , Seie that thes tweyne my sones sitte , oon at thi riythalf , and oon at thi lefthalf , in thi kyngdom .
40020022	Jhesus answeride , and seide , Ye witen not what ye axen . Moun ye drynke the cuppe which Y schal drynke ? Thei seien to hym , We moun .
40020023	He seith to hem , Ye schulen drinke my cuppe ; but to sitte at my riythalf or lefthalf , it is not myn to yyue to you ; but to whiche it is maad redi of my fadir .
40020024	And the ten herynge , hadden indignacioun of the twei britheren .
40020025	But Jhesus clepide hem to hym , and seide , Ye witen , that princis of hethene men ben lordis of hem , and thei that ben gretter , vsen power on hem .
40020026	It schal not be so among you ; but who euer wole be maad gretter among you , be he youre mynystre ;
40020027	and who euer among you wole be the firste , he schal be youre seruaunt .
40020028	As mannus sone cam not to be seruyd , but to serue , and to yyue his lijf redempcioun for manye .
40020029	And whanne thei yeden out of Jerico , miche puple suede him .
40020030	And lo ! twei blynde men saten bisydis the weie , and herden that Jhesus passide ; and thei crieden , and seiden , Lord , the sone of Dauid , haue merci on vs .
40020031	And the puple blamede hem , that thei schulden be stille ; and thei crieden the more , and seiden , Lord , the sone of Dauid , haue merci on vs .
40020032	And Jhesus stood , and clepide hem , and seide , What wolen ye , that Y do to you ?
40020033	Thei seien to him , Lord , that oure iyen be opened .
40020034	And Jhesus hadde merci on hem , and touchide her iyen ; and anoon thei sayen , and sueden him .
40021001	And whanne Jhesus cam nyy to Jerusalem , and cam to Bethfage , at the mount of Olyuete , thanne sente he his twei disciplis , and seide to hem ,
40021002	Go ye in to the castel that is ayens you , and anoon ye schulen fynde an asse tied , and a colt with hir ; vntien ye , and brynge to me .
40021003	And if ony man seie to you ony thing , seie ye , that the Lord hath nede to hem ; and anoon he schal leeue hem .
40021004	Al this was doon , that that thing schulde be fulfillid , that was seid bi the prophete , seiynge , Seie ye to the douyter of Syon , Lo !
40021005	thi kyng cometh to thee , meke , sittynge on an asse , and a fole of an asse vnder yok .
40021006	And the disciplis yeden , and diden as Jhesus comaundide hem .
40021007	And thei brouyten an asse , and the fole , and leiden her clothis on hem , and maden hym sitte aboue .
40021008	And ful myche puple strewiden her clothis in the weie ; othere kittiden braunchis of trees , and strewiden in the weie .
40021009	And the puple that wente bifore , and that sueden , crieden , and seiden , Osanna to the sone of Dauid ; blessid is he that cometh in the name of the Lord ; Osanna in hiy thingis .
40021010	And whanne he was entrid in to Jerusalem , al the citee was stirid , and seide , Who is this ?
40021011	But the puple seide , This is Jhesus , the prophete , of Nazareth of Galilee .
40021012	And Jhesus entride in to the temple of God , and castide out of the temple alle that bouyten and solden ; and he turnede vpsedoun the bordis of chaungeris , and the chayeris of men that solden culueris .
40021013	And he seith to hem , It is writun , Myn hous schal be clepid an hous of preier ; but ye han maad it a denne of theues .
40021014	And blynde and crokid camen to hym in the temple , and he heelide hem .
40021015	But the princis of prestis and scribis , seynge the merueilouse thingis that he dide , and children criynge in the temple , and seiynge , Osanna to the sone of Dauid , hadden indignacioun ,
40021016	and seiden to hym , Herist thou what these seien ? And Jhesus seide to hem , Yhe ; whether ye han neuer redde , That of the mouth of yonge children , and of soukynge childryn , thou hast maad perfit heriyng ?
40021017	And whanne he hadde left hem , he wente forth out of the citee , in to Bethanye ; and there he dwelte , and tauyte hem of the kyngdom of God .
40021018	But on the morowe , he , turnynge ayen in to the citee , hungride .
40021019	And he saye a fige tree bisidis the weie , and cam to it , and foond no thing ther ynne but leeues oneli . And he seide to it , Neuer fruyt come forth of thee , in to with outen eende , And anoon the fige tre was dried vp .
40021020	And disciplis ` sawen , and wondriden , seiynge , Hou anoon it driede .
40021021	And Jhesus answeride , and seide to hem , Treuli Y seie to you , if ye haue feith , and douten not , not oonli ye schulen do of the fige tree , but also if ye seyn to this hil , Take , and caste thee in to the see , it schal be don so .
40021022	And alle thingis what euere ye bileuynge schulen axe in preyer , ye schulen take .
40021023	And whanne he cam in to the temple , the princis of prestis and elder men of the puple camen to hym that tauyte , and seiden , In what power doist thou these thingis ? and who yaf thee this power ?
40021024	Jhesus answeride , and seide to hem , And Y schal axe you o word , the which if ye tellen me , Y schal seie to you , in what power Y do these thingis .
40021025	Of whennys was the baptym of Joon ; of heuene , or of men ? And thei thouyten with ynne hem silf ,
40021026	seiynge , If we seien of heuene , he schal seie to vs , Whi thanne bileuen ye not to hym ? If we seien of men , we dreden the puple , for alle hadden Joon as a prophete .
40021027	And thei answeriden to Jhesu , and seiden , We witen not . And he seide to hem , Nether Y seie to you , in what power Y do these thingis .
40021028	But what semeth to you ? A man hadde twey sones ; and he cam to the firste , and seide , Sone , go worche this dai in my vyneyerd .
40021029	And he answeride , and seide , Y nyle ; but afterward he forthouyte , and wente forth .
40021030	But he cam to ` the tother , and seide on lijk maner . And he answeride , and seide , Lord , Y go ; and he wente not .
40021031	Who of the tweyne dide the fadris wille ? Thei seien to hym , The firste . Jhesus seith to hem , Treuli Y seie to you , for pupplicans and hooris schulen go bifor you ` in to the kyngdom of God .
40021032	For Joon cam to you in the weie of riytwisnesse , and ye bileueden not to him ; but pupplicans and hooris bileueden to hym . But ye sayn , and hadden no forthenkyng aftir , that ye bileueden to hym .
40021033	Here ye another parable . There was an hosebonde man , that plauntide a vynyerd , and heggide it aboute , and dalfe a presour ther ynne , and bildide a tour , and hiride it to erthe tilieris , and wente fer in pilgrimage .
40021034	But whanne the tyme of fruytis neiyede , he sente his seruauntis to the erthe tilieris , to take fruytis of it .
40021035	And the erthetilieris token his seruauntis , and beeten ` the toon , thei slowen another , and thei stonyden another .
40021036	Eftsoone he sente othere seruauntis , mo than the firste , and in lijk maner thei diden to hem .
40021037	And at the laste he sente his sone to hem , and seide , Thei schulen drede my sone .
40021038	But the erthe tilieris , seynge the sone , seiden with ynne hem silf , This is the eire ; come ye , sle we hym , and we schulen haue his eritage .
40021039	And thei token , and castiden hym out of the vynyerd , and slowen hym .
40021040	Therfor whanne the lord of the vyneyerd schal come , what schal he do to thilke erthe tilieris ?
40021041	Thei seien to hym , He schal leese yuele the yuele men , and he schal sette to hire his vyneyerd to othere erthetilieris , whyche schulen yelde to hym fruyt in her tymes .
40021042	Jhesus seith to hem , Redden ye neuer in scripturis , The stoon which bilderis repreueden , this is maad in to the heed of the corner ? Of the Lord this thing is don , and it is merueilous bifor oure iyen .
40021043	Therfor Y seie to you , that the kyngdom of God schal be takun fro you , and shal be youun to a folc doynge fruytis of it .
40021044	And he that schal falle on this stoon , schal be brokun ; but on whom it schal falle , it schal al tobrise hym .
40021045	And whanne the princes of prestis and Farisees hadden herd hise parablis , thei knewen that he seide of hem .
40021046	And thei souyten to holde hym , but thei dredden the puple , for thei hadden hym as a prophete .
40022001	And Jhesus answeride , and spak eftsoone in parablis to hem ,
40022002	and seide , The kyngdom of heuenes is maad lijk to a kyng that made weddyngis to his sone .
40022003	And he sente hise seruauntis for to clepe men that weren bode to the weddyngis , and thei wolden not come .
40022004	Eftsoone he sente othere seruauntis , and seide , Seie ye to the men that ben bode to the feeste , Lo ! Y haue maad redi my meete , my bolis and my volatilis ben slayn , and alle thingis ben redy ; come ye to the weddyngis .
40022005	But thei dispisiden , and wenten forth , oon in to his toun , anothir to his marchaundise .
40022006	But othere helden his seruauntis , and turmentiden hem , and slowen .
40022007	But the kyng , whanne he hadde herd , was wroth ; and he sente hise oostis , and he distruyede tho manquelleris , and brente her citee .
40022008	Thanne he seide to hise seruauntis , The weddyngis ben redi , but thei that weren clepid to the feeste , weren not worthi .
40022009	Therfor go ye to the endis of weies , and whom euere ye fynden , clepe ye to the weddyngis .
40022010	And hise seruauntis yeden out in to weies , and gadriden togider alle that thei founden , good and yuele ; and the bridale was fulfillid with men sittynge at the mete .
40022011	And the kyng entride , to se men sittynge at the mete ; and he siye there a man not clothid with bride cloth .
40022012	And he seide to hym , Freend , hou entridist thou hidir with out bride clothis ? And he was doumbe .
40022013	Thanne the kyng bad hise mynystris , Bynde hym bothe hondis and feet , and sende ye him in to vtmer derknessis ; there schal be wepyng and grentyng of teeth .
40022014	For many ben clepid , but fewe ben chosun .
40022015	Thanne Farisees yeden awei , and token a counsel to take Jhesu in word .
40022016	And thei senden to hym her disciplis , with Erodians , and seien , Maister , we witen , that thou art sothefast , and thou techist in treuthe the weie of God , and thou chargist not of ony man , for thou biholdist not the persoone of men .
40022017	Therfor seie to vs , what it seemeth to thee . Is it leueful that tribute be youun to the emperoure , ether nay ?
40022018	And whanne Jhesus hadde knowe the wickidnesse of hem , he seide , Ypocritis , what tempten ye me ?
40022019	Schewe ye to me the prynte of the money . And thei brouyten to hym a peny .
40022020	And Jhesus seide to hem , Whos is this ymage , and the writyng aboue ?
40022021	Thei seien to hym , The emperouris . Thanne he seide to hem , Therfor yelde ye to the emperoure tho thingis that ben the emperouris , and to God tho thingis that ben of God .
40022022	And thei herden , and wondriden ; and thei leften hym , and wenten awey .
40022023	In that dai Saduceis , that seien there is no risyng ayen to lijf , camen to hym , and axiden him ,
40022024	and seiden , Mayster , Moises seide , if ony man is deed , not hauynge a sone , that his brother wedde his wijf , and reise seed to his brothir .
40022025	And seuen britheren weren at vs ; and the firste weddide a wijf , and is deed . And he hadde no seed , and lefte his wijf to his brother ;
40022026	also the secounde , and the thridde , til to the seuenthe .
40022027	But the laste of alle , the woman is deed .
40022028	Also in the risyng ayen to lijf , whos wijf of the seuene schal sche be ? for alle hadden hir .
40022029	Jhesus answeride , and seide to hem , Ye erren , ` and ye knowen not scripturis , ne the vertu of God .
40022030	For in the rysyng ayen to lijf , nether thei schulen wedde , nethir schulen be weddid ; but thei ben as the aungels of God in heuene .
40022031	And of the risyng ayen of deed men , ` han ye not red , that is seid of the Lord , that seith to you ,
40022032	Y am God of Abraham , and God of Ysaac , and God of Jacob ? he is not God of deede men , but of lyuynge men .
40022033	And the puple herynge , wondriden in his techynge .
40022034	And Fariseis herden that he hadde put silence to Saduceis , and camen togidere .
40022035	And oon of hem , a techere of the lawe , axide Jhesu , and temptide him ,
40022036	Maistir , which is a greet maundement in the lawe ?
40022037	Jhesus seide to him , Thou schalt loue thi Lord God , of al thin herte , and in al thi soule , and in al thi mynde .
40022038	This is the firste and the moste maundement .
40022039	And the secounde is lijk to this ; Thou schalt loue thi neiyebore as thi silf .
40022040	In these twey maundementis hangith al the lawe and the profetis .
40022041	And whanne the Farisees weren gederid togidere , Jhesus axide hem ,
40022042	and seide , What semeth to you of Crist , whos sone is he ? Thei seien to hym , Of Dauid .
40022043	He seith to hem , Hou thanne Dauid in spirit clepith hym Lord ,
40022044	and seith , The Lord seide to my Lord , Sitte on my riythalf , til Y putte thin enemyes a stool of thi feet ?
40022045	Thanne if Dauid clepith hym Lord , hou is he his sone ?
40022046	And no man miyte answere a word to hym , nethir ony man was hardi fro that day , to axe hym more .
40023001	Thanne Jhesus spac to the puple , and to hise disciplis ,
40023002	and seide , On the chayere of Moises , scribis and Farisees han sete .
40023003	Therfor kepe ye , and do ye alle thingis , what euer thingis thei seien to you . But nyle ye do aftir her werkis ; for thei seien , and don not .
40023004	And thei bynden greuouse chargis , and that moun not be borun , and putten on schuldris of men ; but with her fyngur thei wolen not moue hem .
40023005	Therfor thei don alle her werkis ` that thei be seen of men ; for thei drawen abrood her filateries , and magnifien hemmes .
40023006	And thei louen the first sittyng placis in soperis , and the first chaieris in synagogis ;
40023007	and salutaciouns in chepyng , and to be clepid of men maystir .
40023008	But nyle ye be clepid maister ; for oon is youre maystir , and alle ye ben britheren .
40023009	And nyle ye clepe to you a fadir on erthe , for oon is your fadir , that is in heuenes .
40023010	Nether be ye clepid maistris , for oon is youre maister , Crist .
40023011	He that is grettest among you , schal be youre mynystre .
40023012	For he that hieth himself , schal be mekid ; and he that mekith hym silf , schal be enhaunsid .
40023013	But wo to you , scribis and Farisees , ipocritis , that closen the kyngdom of heuenes bifore men ; and ye entren not , nether suffren men entrynge to entre .
40023014	Wo to you , scribis and Farisees , ipocritis , that eten the housis of widowis , and preien bi longe preier ; for this thing ye schulen take more doom .
40023015	Wo to you , scribis and Farisees , ypocritis , that goon aboute the see and the loond , to make o prosilite ; and whanne he is maad , ye maken hym a sone of helle , double more than ye ben .
40023016	Wo to you , blynde lederis , that seien , Who euer swerith bi the temple of God , it is ` no thing ; but he that swerith in the gold of the temple , is dettoure .
40023017	Ye foolis and blynde , for what is grettere , the gold , or the temple that halewith the gold ?
40023018	And who euer swerith in the auter , it is no thing ; but he that swerith in the yifte that is on the auter , owith .
40023019	Blynde men , for what is more , the yifte , or the auter that halewith the yifte ?
40023020	Therfor he that swerith in the auter , swerith in it , and in alle thingis that ben ther on .
40023021	And he that swerith in the temple , swerith in it , and in hym that dwellith in the temple .
40023022	And he that swerith in heuene , swerith in the trone of God , and in hym that sittith ther on .
40023023	Wo to you , scribis and Farisees , ypocritis , that tithen mynte , anete , and cummyn , and han left tho thingis that ben of more charge of the lawe , doom , and merci , and feith . And it bihofte to do these thingis , and not to leeue tho .
40023024	Blynde lederis , clensinge a gnatte , but swolewynge a camel .
40023025	Woo to you , scribis and Farisees , ypocritis , that clensen the cuppe and the plater with outforth ; but with ynne ye ben ful of raueyne and vnclennesse .
40023026	Thou blynde Farisee , clense the cuppe and the plater with ynneforth , that that that is with outforth be maad clene .
40023027	Wo to you , scribis and Farisees , ipocritis , that ben lijk to sepulcris whitid , whiche with outforth semen faire to men ; but with ynne thei ben fulle of boonus of deed men , and of al filthe .
40023028	So ye with outforth semen iust to men ; but with ynne ye ben ful of ypocrisy and wickidnesse .
40023029	Wo to you , scribis and Farisees , ipocritis , that bilden sepulcris of profetis , and maken faire the birielis of iust men ,
40023030	and seien , If we hadden be in the daies of oure fadris , we schulden not haue be her felowis in the blood of prophetis .
40023031	And so ye ben in witnessyng to you silf , that ye ben the sones of hem that slowen the prophetis .
40023032	And fulfille ye the mesure of youre fadris .
40023033	Ye eddris , and eddris briddis , hou schulen ye fle fro the doom of helle ?
40023034	Therfor lo ! Y sende to you profetis , and wise men , and scribis ; and of hem ye schulen sle and crucifie , and of hem ye schulen scourge in youre sinagogis , and schulen pursue fro cite in to citee ;
40023035	that al the iust blood come on you , that was sched on the erthe , fro the blood of iust Abel to the blood of Zacarie , the sone of Barachie , whom ye slowen bitwixe the temple and the auter .
40023036	Treuli Y seie to you , alle these thingis schulen come on this generacioun .
40023037	Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that sleest prophetis , and stoonest hem that ben sent to thee , hou ofte wolde Y gadere togidere thi children , as an henne gaderith togidir her chikenes vndir hir wengis , and thou woldist not .
40023038	Lo ! youre hous schal be left to you desert .
40023039	And Y seie to you , ye schulen not se me fro hennus forth , til ye seien , Blessid is he , that cometh in the name of the Lord .
40024001	And Jhesus wente out of the temple ; and his disciplis camen to hym , to schewe hym the bildyngis of the temple .
40024002	But he answeride , and seide to hem , Seen ye alle these thingis ? Treuli Y seie to you , a stoon schal not be left here on a stoon , that ne it schal be destried .
40024003	And whanne he satte on the hille of Olyuete , hise disciplis camen to hym priueli , and seiden , Seie vs , whanne these thingis schulen be , and what token of thi comyng , and of the ending of the world .
40024004	And Jhesus answeride , and seide to hem , Loke ye , that no man disseyue you .
40024005	For many schulen come in my name , and schulen seie , Y am Crist ; and thei schulen disseyue manye .
40024006	For ye schulen here batels , and opyniouns of batels ; se ye that ye be not disturblid ; for it byhoueth these thingis to be don , but not yit is the ende .
40024007	Folk schal rise togidere ayens folc , and rewme ayens rewme , and pestilences , and hungris , and the erthemouyngis schulen be bi placis ;
40024008	and alle these ben bigynnyngis of sorewes .
40024009	Thanne men schulen bitake you in to tribulacion , and schulen sle you , and ye schulen be in hate to alle folk for my name .
40024010	And thanne many schulen be sclaundrid , and bitraye ech other , and thei schulen hate ech other .
40024011	And many false prophetis schulen rise , and disseyue manye .
40024012	And for wickidnesse schal ` be plenteuouse , the charite of manye schal wexe coold ;
40024013	but he that schal dwelle stable in to the ende , schal be saaf .
40024014	And this gospel of the kyngdom schal be prechid in al the world , in witnessyng to al folc ;
40024015	and thanne the ende schal come . Therfor whanne ye se the abhomynacioun of discomfort , that is seid of Danyel , the prophete , stondynge in the hooli place ; he that redith , vndirstonde he ;
40024016	thanne thei that ben in Judee , fle to the mounteyns ; and he that is in the hous roof ,
40024017	come not doun to take ony thing of his hous ; and he that is in the feeld ,
40024018	turne not ayen to take his coote .
40024019	But wo to hem that ben with child , and nurischen in tho daies .
40024020	Preye ye , that youre fleyng be not maad in wynter , or in the saboth .
40024021	For thanne schal be greet tribulacioun , what maner ` was not fro the bigynnyng of the world to now , nether schal be maad .
40024022	And but tho daies hadden be abreggide , ech flesch schulde not be maad saaf ; but tho daies schulen be maad schort , for the chosun men .
40024023	Thanne if ony man seie to you , Lo ! here is Crist , or there , nyle ye bileue .
40024024	For false Cristis and false prophetis schulen rise , and thei schulen yyue grete tokenes and wondrys ; so that also the chosun be led in to erroure , if it may be done .
40024025	Lo ! Y haue bifor seid to you .
40024026	Therfor if thei seie to you , Lo ! he is in desert , nyle ye go out ; lo ! in priuey placis , nyle ye trowe .
40024027	For as leit goith out fro the eest , and apperith in to the weste , so schal be also the coming of mannus sone .
40024028	Where euer the bodi schal be , also the eglis schulen be gaderid thidur .
40024029	And anoon after the tribulacioun of tho daies , the sunne schal be maad derk , and the moone schal not yyue hir liyt , and the sterris schulen falle fro heuene , and the vertues of heuenes schulen be moued .
40024030	And thanne the tokene of mannus sone schal appere in heuene , and thanne alle kynredis of the erthe schulen weile ; and thei schulen see mannus sone comynge in the cloudis of heuene , with miche vertu and maieste .
40024031	And he schal sende hise aungels with a trumpe , and a greet vois ; and thei schulen gedere hise chosun fro foure wyndis , fro the hiyest thingis of heuenes to the endis of hem .
40024032	And lerne ye the parable of a fige tre . Whanne his braunche is now tendir , and the leeues ben sprongun , ye witen that somer is nyy ;
40024033	` so and ye whanne ye seen alle these thingis , wite ye that it is nyy , in the yatis .
40024034	Treuli Y seie to you , for this generacioun schal not passe , til alle thingis be don ;
40024035	heuene and erthe schulen passe , but my wordis schulen not passe .
40024036	But of thilke dai and our no man wote , nethir aungels of heuenes , but the fadir aloone .
40024037	But as it was in the daies of Noe , so schal be the comyng of mannus sone .
40024038	For as in the daies bifore the greet flood , thei weren etynge and drynkynge , weddynge and takynge to weddyng , to that dai , that Noe entride in to the schippe ;
40024039	and thei knewen not , til the greet flood cam , and took alle men , so schal be the comyng of mannus sone .
40024040	Thanne tweyne schulen be in o feeld , oon schal be takun , and another left ;
40024041	twey wymmen schulen be gryndynge in o queerne , oon schal be takun , and ` the tother left ; tweyn in a bedde , ` the toon schal be takun , and the tother left .
40024042	Therfor wake ye , for ye witen not in what our the Lord schal come .
40024043	But wite ye this , that if the hosebonde man wiste in what our the thefe were to come , certis he wolde wake , and suffre not his hous to be vndurmyned .
40024044	And therfor be ye redi , for in what our ye gessen not , mannus sone schal come .
40024045	Who gessist thou is a trewe seruaunt and prudent , whom his lord ordeyned on his meynee , to yyue hem mete in tyme ?
40024046	Blessed is that seruaunt , whom ` his lord , whanne he schal come , schal fynde so doynge .
40024047	Treuli Y seye to you , for on alle his goodis he schal ordeyne hym .
40024048	But if thilke yuel seruaunt seie in his herte , My lord tarieth to come ,
40024049	and bigynneth to smyte hise euen seruauntis , and ete , and drynke with drunken men ;
40024050	the lord of that seruaunt schal come in the dai which he hopith not , and in the our that he knowith not ,
40024051	and schal departe hym , and putte his part with ypocritis ; there schal be wepyng , and gryntyng of teeth .
40025001	Thanne the kyngdoom of heuenes schal be lijk to ten virgyns , whiche token her laumpis , and wenten out ayens the hosebonde and the wijf ;
40025002	and fyue of hem weren foolis , and fyue prudent .
40025003	But the fyue foolis token her laumpis , and token not oile with hem ;
40025004	but the prudent token oile in her vessels with the laumpis .
40025005	And whilis the hosebonde tariede , alle thei nappiden and slepten .
40025006	But at mydnyyt a cryy was maad , Lo ! the spouse cometh , go ye oute to mete with him .
40025007	Thanne alle tho virgyns risen vp , and araieden her laumpis .
40025008	And the foolis seiden to the wise , Yyue ye to vs of youre oile , for oure laumpis ben quenchid .
40025009	The prudent answeriden , and seiden , Lest perauenture it suffice not to vs and to you , go ye rather to men that sellen , and bie to you .
40025010	And while thei wenten for to bie , the spouse cam ; and tho that weren redi , entreden with him to the weddyngis ; and the yate was schit .
40025011	And at the last the othere virgyns camen , and seiden , Lord , lord , opene to vs .
40025012	And he answeride , and seide , Treuli Y seie to you , Y knowe you not .
40025013	Therfor wake ye , for ye witen not the dai ne the our .
40025014	For as a man that goith in pilgrimage , clepide hise seruauntis , and bitook to hem hise goodis ;
40025015	and to oon he yaf fyue talentis , and to another tweyne , and to another oon , to ech after his owne vertu ; and wente forth anoon .
40025016	And he that hadde fyue besauntis , wente forth , and wrouyte in hem , and wan othere fyue .
40025017	Also and he that hadde takun tweyne , wan othere tweyne .
40025018	But he that hadde takun oon , yede forth , and dalf in to the erthe , and hidde the money of his lord .
40025019	But after long tyme , the lord of tho seruauntis cam , and rekenede with hem .
40025020	And he that hadde takun fyue besauntis , cam , and brouyte othere fyue , and seide , Lord , thou bytokist to me fyue besauntis , loo ! Y haue getun aboue fyue othere .
40025021	His lord seide to hym , Wel be thou , good seruaunt and feithful ; for on fewe thingis thou hast be trewe , Y schal ordeyne thee on manye thingis ; entre thou in to the ioye of thi lord .
40025022	And he that hadde takun twey talentis , cam , and seide , Lord , thou bitokist to me twey besauntis ; loo !
40025023	Y haue wonnen ouer othir tweyne . His lord seide to him , Wel be thou , good seruaunt and trewe ; for on fewe thingis thou hast be trewe , Y schal ordeyne thee on many thingis ; entre thou in to the ioie of thi lord .
40025024	But he that hadde takun o besaunt , cam , and seide , Lord , Y woot that thou art an hard man ; thou repist where thou hast not sowe , and thou gederist togidere where thou hast not spred abrood ;
40025025	and Y dredynge wente , and hidde thi besaunt in the erthe ; lo ! thou hast that that is thin .
40025026	His lord answeride , and seide to hym , Yuel seruaunt and slowe , wistist thou that Y repe where Y sewe not , and gadir to gidere where Y spredde not abrood ?
40025027	Therfor it bihofte thee to bitake my money to chaungeris , that whanne Y cam , Y schulde resseyue that that is myn with vsuris .
40025028	Therfor take awei fro hym the besaunt , and yyue ye to hym that hath ten besauntis .
40025029	For to euery man that hath me schal yyue , and he schal encreese ; but fro hym that hath not , also that that hym semeth to haue , schal be taken awey fro him .
40025030	And caste ye out the vnprofitable seruaunt in to vtmer derknessis ; ther schal be wepyng , and gryntyng of teeth .
40025031	Whanne mannus sone schal come in his maieste , and alle hise aungels with hym , thanne he schal sitte on the sege of his maieste ;
40025032	and alle folkis schulen be gaderid bifor hym ,
40025033	and he schal departe hem atwynne , as a scheeperde departith scheep from kidis ; and he schal sette the scheep on his riythalf , and the kidis on the lefthalf .
40025034	Thanne the kyng schal seie to hem , that schulen be on his riythalf , Come ye , the blessid of my fadir , take ye in possessioun the kyngdoom maad redi to you fro the makyng of the world .
40025035	For Y hungride , and ye yauen me to ete ; Y thristide , and ye yauen me to drynke ; Y was herboreles , and ye herboriden me ;
40025036	nakid , and ye hiliden me ; sijk , and ye visitiden me ; Y was in prisoun , and ye camen to me .
40025037	Thanne iust men schulen answere to hym , and seie , Lord , whanne siyen we thee hungry , and we fedden thee ; thristi , and we yauen to thee drynk ?
40025038	and whanne sayn we thee herborles , and we herboreden thee ; or nakid , and we hiliden thee ?
40025039	or whanne sayn we thee sijk , or in prisoun , and we camen to thee ?
40025040	And the kyng answerynge schal seie to hem , Treuli Y seie to you , as longe as ye diden to oon of these my leeste britheren , ye diden to me .
40025041	Thanne the kyng schal seie also to hem , that schulen be on his lefthalf , Departe fro me , ye cursid , in to euerlastynge fijr , that is maad redi to the deuel and hise aungels .
40025042	For Y hungride , and ye yauen not me to ete ; Y thristide , and ye yauen not me to drynke ;
40025043	Y was herborles , and ye herberden not me ; nakid , and ye keuerden not me ; sijk , and in prisoun , and ye visitiden not me .
40025044	Thanne and thei schulen answere to hym , and schulen seie , Lord , whanne sayn we thee hungrynge , or thristynge , or herboreles , or nakid , or sijk , or in prisoun , and we serueden not to thee ?
40025045	Thanne he schal answere to hem , and seie , Treuli Y seie to you , ` hou longe ye diden not to oon of these leeste , nether ye diden to me .
40025046	And these schulen goo in to euerlastynge turment ; but the iust men schulen go in to euerlastynge lijf .
40026001	And it was doon , whanne Jhesus hadde endid alle these wordis , he seide to hise disciplis ,
40026002	Ye witen , that aftir twei daies pask schal be maad , and mannus sone schal be bitakun to be crucified .
40026003	Than the princes of prestis and the elder men of the puple were gaderid in to the halle of the prince of prestis , that was seid Cayfas ,
40026004	and maden a counsel to holde Jhesu with gile , and sle him ;
40026005	but thei seiden , Not in the haliday , lest perauenture noyse were maad in the puple .
40026006	And whanne Jhesus was in Betanye , in the hous of Symount leprous ,
40026007	a womman that hadde a box of alabastre of precious oynement , cam to hym , and schedde out on the heed of hym restynge .
40026008	And disciplis seynge hadden dedeyn , and seiden , Wherto this loss ? for it myyte be seld for myche ,
40026009	and be youun to pore men .
40026010	But Jhesus knewe , and seide to hem , What ben ye heuy to this womman ? for sche hath wrouyt in me a good werk .
40026011	For ye schulen euere haue pore men with you , but ye schulen not algatis haue me .
40026012	This womman sendynge this oynement in to my bodi , dide to birie me .
40026013	Treuli Y seie to you , where euer this gospel schal be prechid in al the world , it schal be seid , that sche dide this , in mynde of hym .
40026014	Thanne oon of the twelue , that was clepid Judas Scarioth , wente forth to the princis of prestis ,
40026015	and seide to hem , What wolen ye yyue to me , and Y schal bitake hym to you ? And thei ordeyneden to hym thretti pans of siluer .
40026016	And fro that tyme he souyte oportunyte , to bitraye hym .
40026017	And in the firste dai of therf looues the disciplis camen to Jhesu , and seiden , Where wolt thou we make redi to thee , to ete paske ?
40026018	Jhesus seide , Go ye into the citee to ` sum man , and seie to hym , The maistir seith , My tyme is nyy ; at thee Y make paske with my disciplis .
40026019	And the disciplis diden , as Jhesus comaundide to hem ; and thei maden the paske redi .
40026020	And whanne euentid was come , he sat to mete with hise twelue disciplis .
40026021	And he seide to hem , as thei eten , Treuli Y seie to you , that oon of you schal bitraye me .
40026022	And thei ful sori bigunnen ech bi hym silf to seie , Lord , whether ` Y am ?
40026023	And he answeride , and seide , He that puttith with me his hoond in the plater , schal bitraye me .
40026024	Forsothe mannus sone goith , as it is writun of hym ; but wo to that man , bi whom mannus sone schal be bitrayed ; it were good to hym , if that man hadde not be borun .
40026025	But Judas that bitraiede hym , answeride , seiynge , Maister , whether ` Y am ? Jhesus seide to hym , Thou hast seid .
40026026	And while thei soupeden , Jhesus took breed , and blesside , and brak , and yaf to hise disciplis , and seide , Take ye , and ete ; this is my body .
40026027	And he took the cuppe , and dide thankyngis , and yaf to hem ,
40026028	and seide , Drynke ye alle herof ; this is my blood of the newe testament , which schal be sched for many , in to remissioun of synnes .
40026029	And Y seie to you , Y schal not drynke fro this tyme , of this fruyt of the vyne , in to that dai whanne Y schal drynke it newe with you , in the kyngdom of my fadir .
40026030	And whanne the ympne was seid , thei wenten out in to the mount of Olyuete .
40026031	Thanne Jhesus seide to hem , Alle ye schulen suffre sclaundre in me , in this niyt ; for it is writun , Y schal smyte the scheeperde , and the scheep of the flok schulen be scaterid .
40026032	But aftir that Y schal rise ayen , Y schal go bifore you in to Galilee .
40026033	Petre answeride , and seide to hym , Thouy alle schulen be sclaundrid in thee , Y schal neuer be sclaundrid .
40026034	Jhesus seide to him , Treuli Y seie to thee , for in this nyyt bifor the cok crowe , thries thou schalt denye me .
40026035	Peter seide to him , Yhe , thouy it bihoue that Y die with thee , Y schal not denye thee . Also alle the disciplis seiden .
40026036	Thanne Jhesus cam with hem in to a toun , that is seid Jessamanye . And he seide to his disciplis , Sitte ye here , the while Y go thider , and preye .
40026037	And whanne he hadde take Peter , and twei sones of Zebedee , he bigan to be heuy and sori .
40026038	Thanne he seide to hem , My soule is soreuful to the deeth ; abide ye here , and wake ye with me .
40026039	And he yede forth a litil , and felde doun on his face , preiynge , and seiynge , My fader , if it is possible , passe this cuppe fro me ; netheles not as Y wole , but as thou wolt .
40026040	And he cam to his disciplis , and foond hem slepynge . And he seide to Petir , So , whethir ye myyten not oon our wake with me ?
40026041	Wake ye , and preye ye , that ye entre not in to temptacioun ; for the spirit is redi , but the fleisch is sijk .
40026042	Eft the secounde tyme he wente , and preyede , seiynge , My fadir , if this cuppe may not passe , but Y drynke hym , thi wille be doon .
40026043	And eftsoone he cam , and foond hem slepynge ; for her iyen weren heuyed .
40026044	And he lefte hem , and wente eftsoone , and preiede the thridde tyme , and seide the same word .
40026045	Thanne he cam to his disciplis , and seide to hem , Slepe ye now , and reste ye ; loo ! the our hath neiyed , and mannus sone schal be takun in to the hondis of synneris ;
40026046	rise ye , go we ; loo ! he that schal take me , is nyy .
40026047	Yit the while he spak , lo ! Judas , oon of the twelue , cam , and with hym a greet cumpeny , with swerdis and battis , sent fro the princis of prestis , and fro the eldre men of the puple .
40026048	And he that bitraiede hym , yaf to hem a tokene , and seide , Whom euer Y schal kisse , he it is ; holde ye hym .
40026049	And anoon he cam to Jhesu , and seid , Haile , maister ;
40026050	and he kisside hym . And Jhesus seide to hym , Freend , wherto art thou comun ? Thanne thei camen niy , and leiden hoondis on Jhesu , and helden hym .
40026051	And lo ! oon of hem that weren with Jhesu , streiyte out his hoond , and drouy out his swerd ; and he smoot the seruaunt of the prince of prestis , and kitte of his ere .
40026052	Thanne Jhesus seide to hym , Turne thi swerd in to his place ; for alle that taken swerd , schulen perische bi swerd .
40026053	Whether gessist thou , that Y may not preie my fadir , and he schal yyue to me now mo than twelue legiouns of aungels ?
40026054	Hou thanne schulen the scriptures be fulfilled ? for so it bihoueth to be doon .
40026055	In that our Jhesus seide to the puple , As to a theef ye han gon out , with swerdis and battis , to take me ; dai bi dai Y sat among you , and tauyt in the temple , and ye helden me not .
40026056	But al this thing was don , that the scripturis of profetis schulden be fulfillid . Thanne alle the disciplis fledden , and leften hym .
40026057	And thei helden Jhesu , and ledden hym to Cayfas , the prince of prestis , where the scribis and the Farisees , and the eldre men of the puple weren comun togidere .
40026058	But Petir swede him afer , in to the halle of the prince of prestis ; and he wente in , and sat with the seruauntis , to se the ende .
40026059	And the prince of prestis , and al the counsel souyten fals witnessing ayens Jhesu , that thei schulden take hym to deeth ;
40026060	and thei founden not , whanne manye false witnessis weren comun . But at the laste , twei false witnessis camen ,
40026061	and seiden , ` This seide , Y may distruye the temple of God , and after the thridde dai bilde it ayen .
40026062	And the prince of prestis roos , and seide to hym , Answerist thou no thing to tho thingis , that these witnessen ayens thee ?
40026063	But Jhesus was stille . And the prince of prestis seide to hym , Y coniure thee bi lyuynge God , that thou seie to vs , if thou art Crist , the sone of God .
40026064	Jhesus seide to him , Thou hast seid ; netheles Y seie to you , ` fro hennus forth ye schulen se mannus sone sittinge at the riythalf of the vertu of God , and comynge in the cloudis of heuene .
40026065	Thanne the prince of prestis to-rente his clothis , and seide , He hath blasfemed ; what yit han we nede to witnessis ? lo ! now ye han herd blasfemye ; what semeth to you ?
40026066	And thei answeriden , and seiden , He is gilti of deeth .
40026067	Thanne thei speten ` in to his face , and smyten hym with buffatis ; and othere yauen strokis with the pawme of her hondis in his face ,
40026068	and seide , Thou Crist , arede to vs , who is he that smoot thee ?
40026069	And Petir sat with outen in the halle ; and a damysel cam to hym , and seide , Thou were with Jhesu of Galilee .
40026070	And he denyede bifor alle men , and seide , Y woot not what thou seist .
40026071	And whanne he yede out at the yate , another damysel say hym , and seide to hem that weren there , And this was with Jhesu of Nazareth .
40026072	And eftsoone he denyede with an ooth , For I knewe not the man .
40026073	And a litil aftir , thei that stooden camen , and seiden to Petir , Treuli thou art of hem ; for thi speche makith thee knowun .
40026074	Thanne he bigan to warie and to swere , that he knewe not the man . And anoon the cok crewe .
40026075	And Petir bithouyte on the word of Jhesu , that he hadde seid , Bifore the cok crowe , thries thou schalt denye me . And he yede out , and wepte bitterli .
40027001	But whanne the morowtid was comun , alle the princis of prestis , and the eldre men of the puple token counsel ayens Jhesu , that thei schulden take hym to the deeth .
40027002	And thei ledden him boundun , and bitoken to Pilat of Pounce , iustice .
40027003	Thanne Judas that bitraiede hym , say that he was dampned , he repentide , and brouyte ayen the thretti pans to the princis of prestis , and to the elder men of the puple ,
40027004	and seide , Y haue synned , bitraiynge riytful blood . And thei seiden , What to vs ? bise thee .
40027005	And whanne he hadde cast forth the siluer in the temple , he passide forth , and yede , and hongide hym silf with a snare .
40027006	And the princis of prestis token the siluer , and seide , It is not leueful to putte it in to the treserie , for it is the prijs of blood .
40027007	And whanne thei hadden take counsel , thei bouyten with it a feeld of a potter , in to biryyng of pilgrymys .
40027008	Herfor thilke feeld is clepid Acheldemac , that is , a feeld of blood , in to this dai .
40027009	Thanne that was fulfillid , that was seid bi the prophete Jeremye , seiynge , And thei han takun thretti pans , the prijs of a man preysid , whom thei preiseden of the children of Israel ;
40027010	and thei yauen hem in to a feeld of a potter , as the Lord hath ordenyd to me .
40027011	And Jhesus stood bifor the domesman ; and the iustice axide him , and seide , Art thou king of Jewis ?
40027012	Jhesus seith to hym , Thou seist . And whanne he was accusid of the princis of prestis , and of the eldere men of the puple , he answeride no thing .
40027013	Thanne Pilat seith to him , Herist thou not , hou many witnessyngis thei seien ayens thee ?
40027014	And he answeride not ` to hym ony word , so that the iustice wondride greetli .
40027015	But for a solempne dai the iustice was wont to delyuere to the puple oon boundun , whom thei wolden .
40027016	And he hadde tho a famous man boundun , that was seid Barrabas .
40027017	Therfor Pilate seide to hem , whanne thei weren to gidere , Whom wolen ye , that Y delyuere to you ? whether Barabas , or Jhesu , that is seid Crist ?
40027018	For he wiste , that bi enuye thei bitraieden hym .
40027019	And while he sat for domesman , his wijf sente to hym , and seide , No thing to thee and to that iust man ; for Y haue suffrid this dai many thingis for hym , bi a visioun .
40027020	Forsothe the prince of prestis , and the eldere men counseiliden the puple , that thei schulden axe Barabas , but thei schulden distrye Jhesu .
40027021	But the iustice answeride , and seide to hem , Whom of the tweyn wolen ye , that be delyuerit to you ? And thei seiden , Barabas .
40027022	Pilat seith to hem , What thanne schal Y do of Jhesu , that is seid Crist ?
40027023	Alle seien , ` Be he crucified . The iustice seith to hem , What yuel hath he doon ? And thei crieden more , and seiden , Be he crucified .
40027024	And Pilat seynge that he profitide no thing , but that the more noyse was maad , took watir , and waischide hise hondis bifor the puple , and seide , Y am giltles of the blood of this riytful man ; bise you .
40027025	And al the puple answeride , and seide , His blood be on vs , and on oure children .
40027026	Thanne he deliuerede to hem Barabas , but he took to hem Jhesu scourgid , to be crucified .
40027027	Thanne knyytis of the iustice token Jhesu in the moot halle , and gadriden to hym al the cumpeny ` of knyytis .
40027028	And thei vnclothiden hym , and diden aboute hym a reed mantil ;
40027029	and thei foldiden a coroun of thornes , and putten on his heed , and a rehed in his riyt hoond ; and thei kneliden bifore hym , and scornyden hym , and seiden , Heil , kyng of Jewis .
40027030	And thei speten on hym , and tooken a rehed , and smoot his heed .
40027031	And aftir that thei hadden scorned him , thei vnclothiden hym of the mantil , and thei clothiden hym with hise clothis , and ledden hym to ` crucifien hym .
40027032	And as thei yeden out , thei founden a man of Cirenen comynge fro the toun , Symont bi name ; thei constreyneden hym to take his cross .
40027033	And thei camen in to a place that is clepid Golgatha , that is , the place of Caluarie .
40027034	And thei yauen hym to drynke wyne meynd with galle ; and whanne he hadde tastid , he wolde not drynke .
40027035	And aftir that thei hadden crucified hym , thei departiden his clothis , and kesten lotte , to fulfille that is seid bi the prophete , seiynge , Thei partiden to hem my clothis , and on my clooth thei kesten lott .
40027036	And thei seten , and kepten him ;
40027037	and setten aboue his heed his cause writun , This is Jhesu of Nazareth , kyng of Jewis .
40027038	Thanne twey theues weren crucified with hym , oon on the riythalf , and oon on the lefthalf .
40027039	And men that passiden forth blasfemeden hym ,
40027040	mouynge her heedis , and seiynge , Vath to thee , that distriest the temple of God , and in the thridde dai bildist it ayen ; saue thou thi silf ; if thou art the sone of God , come doun of the cross .
40027041	Also and princis of prestis scornynge , with scribis and elder men ,
40027042	seiden , He made othere men saaf , he may not make hym silf saaf ; if he is kyng of Israel , come he now doun fro the crosse , and we bileuen to hym ;
40027043	he tristide in God ; delyuer he hym now , if he wole ; for he seide , That Y am Goddis sone .
40027044	And the theues , that weren crucified with hym , vpbreididen hym of the same thing .
40027045	But fro the sixte our derknessis weren maad on al the erthe , to the nynthe our .
40027046	And aboute the nynthe our Jhesus criede with a greet vois , and seide , Heli , Heli , lamazabatany , that is , My God , my God , whi hast thou forsake me ?
40027047	And summen that stoden there , and herynge , seiden , This clepith Helye .
40027048	And anoon oon of hem rennynge , took and fillide a spounge with vynegre , and puttide on a rehed , and yaf to hym to drynke .
40027049	But othir seiden , Suffre thou ; se we whether Helie come to deliuer hym .
40027050	Forsothe Jhesus eftsoone criede with a greet voyce , and yaf vp the goost .
40027051	And lo ! the veil of the temple was to-rent in twey parties , fro the hiest to the lowest . And the erthe schoke , and stoonus weren cloue ; and birielis weren openyd ,
40027052	and many bodies of seyntis that hadden slepte , rysen vp .
40027053	And thei yeden out of her birielis , and aftir his resurreccioun thei camen in to the holi citee , and apperiden to many .
40027054	And the centurien and thei that weren with hym kepinge Jhesu , whanne thei saien the erthe schakynge , and tho thingis that weren doon , thei dredden greetli ,
40027055	and seiden , Verili this was Goddis sone . And ther weren there many wymmen afer , that sueden Jhesu fro Galilee , and mynystriden to hym .
40027056	Among whiche was Marie Magdalene , and Marie , the modir of James , and of Joseph , and the modir of Zebedees sones .
40027057	But whanne the euenyng was come , ther cam a riche man of Armathi , Joseph bi name , and he was a disciple of Jhesu .
40027058	He wente to Pilat , and axide the bodi of Jhesu .
40027059	Thanne Pilat comaundide the bodie to be youun . And whanne the bodi was takun , Joseph lappide it in a clene sendel ,
40027060	and leide it in his newe biriel , that he hadde hewun in a stoon ; and he walewide a greet stoon to the dore of the biriel , and wente awei .
40027061	But Marie Maudelene and anothir Marie weren there , sittynge ayens the sepulcre .
40027062	And on ` the tother dai , that is aftir pask euen , the princis of prestis and the Farisees camen togidere to Pilat ,
40027063	and seiden , Sir , we han mynde , that thilke giloure seide yit lyuynge , Aftir thre daies Y schal rise ayen to lijf .
40027064	Therfor comaunde thou , that the sepulcre be kept in to the thridde dai ; lest hise disciplis comen , and stelen hym , and seie to the puple , He hath rise fro deeth ; and the laste errour schal be worse than the formere .
40027065	Pilat seide to hem , Ye han the kepyng ; go ye , kepe ye as ye kunnen .
40027066	And thei yeden forth , and kepten the sepulcre , markynge the stoon , with keperis .
40028001	But in the euentid of the sabat , that bigynneth to schyne in the firste dai of the woke , Marie Mawdelene cam , and another Marie , to se the sepulcre .
40028002	And lo ! ther was maad a greet ertheschakyng ; for the aungel of the Lord cam doun fro heuene , and neiyede , and turnede awei the stoon , and sat theron .
40028003	And his lokyng was as leit , and hise clothis as snowe ;
40028004	and for drede of hym the keperis weren afeerd , and thei weren maad as deede men .
40028005	But the aungel answeride , and seide to the wymmen , Nyle ye drede , for Y woot that ye seken Jhesu , that was crucified ;
40028006	he is not here , for he is risun , as he seide ; come ye , and se ye the place , where the Lord was leid .
40028007	And go ye soone , and seie ye to his disciplis , that he is risun . And lo ! he schal go bifore you in to Galilee ; there ye schulen se hym .
40028008	Lo ! Y haue biforseid to you . And thei wenten out soone fro the biriels , with drede and greet ioye , rennynge to telle to hise disciplis .
40028009	And lo ! Jhesus mette hem , and seide , Heile ye . And thei neiyeden , and heelden his feet , and worschipiden him .
40028010	Thanne Jhesus seide to hem , Nyle ye drede ; go ye , ` telle ye to my britheren , that thei go in to Galile ; there thei schulen se me .
40028011	And whanne thei weren goon , lo ! summe of the keperis camen in to the citee , and telden to the princis of prestis alle thingis that weren doon .
40028012	And whanne thei weren gaderid togidere with the elder men , and hadden take her counseil , thei yauen to the kniytis miche monei , and seiden , Seie ye ,
40028013	that hise disciplis camen bi nyyt , and han stolen hym , while ye slepten .
40028014	And if this be herd of the iustice , we schulen counseile hym , and make you sikir .
40028015	And whanne the monei was takun , thei diden , as thei weren tauyt . And this word is pupplischid among the Jewis , til in to this day .
40028016	And the enleuen disciplis wenten in to Galilee , in to an hille , where Jhesus hadde ordeyned to hem .
40028017	And thei sayn hym , and worschipiden ; but summe of hem doutiden .
40028018	And Jhesus cam nyy , and spak to hem , and seide , Al power in heuene and in erthe is youun to me .
40028019	Therfor go ye , and teche alle folkis , baptisynge hem in the name of the Fadir , and of the Sone , and of the Hooli Goost ;
40028020	techynge hem to kepe alle thingis , what euer thingis Y haue comaundid to you ; and lo ! Y am with you in alle daies , in to the ende of the world .
41001001	The bigynnyng of the gospel of Jhesu Crist , the sone of God .
41001002	As it is writun in Ysaie , the prophete , Lo ! Y sende myn aungel bifor thi face , that schal make thi weie redi bifor thee .
41001003	The vois of a crier in desert , Make ye redi the weie of the Lord , make ye hise paththis riyt .
41001004	Joon was in desert baptisynge , and prechynge the baptym of penaunce , in to remissioun of synnes .
41001005	And al the cuntre of Judee wente out to hym , and alle men of Jerusalem ; and thei weren baptisid of hym in the flom Jordan , ` and knoulechiden her synnes .
41001006	And Joon was clothid with heeris of camels , and a girdil of skyn was about hise leendis ; and he ete hony soukis , and wilde hony , and prechide ,
41001007	and seide , A stronger than Y schal come aftir me , and Y am not worthi to knele doun , and vnlace his schoone .
41001008	Y haue baptisid you in watir ; but he schal baptise you in the Hooli Goost .
41001009	And it was don in tho daies , Jhesus cam fro Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptisid of Joon in Jordan .
41001010	And anoon he wente up of the watir , and saye heuenes opened , and the Hooli Goost comynge doun as a culuer , and dwellynge in hym .
41001011	And a vois was maad fro heuenes , Thou art my loued sone , in thee Y am plesid .
41001012	And anoon the Spirit puttide hym forth in to deseert .
41001013	And he was in deseert fourti daies and fourti nyytis , and was temptid of Sathanas , and he was with beestis , and aungels mynystriden to hym .
41001014	But aftir that Joon was takun , Jhesus cam in to Galilee , and prechide the gospel of the kyngdoom of God ,
41001015	and seide , That the tyme is fulfillid , and the kyngdoom of God schal come nyy ; do ye penaunce , and bileue ye to the gospel .
41001016	And as he passide bisidis the see of Galilee , he say Symount , and Andrew , his brother , castynge her nettis in to the see ; for thei weren fisscheris .
41001017	And Jhesus seide to hem , Come ye aftir me ; Y schal make you to be maad fisscheris of men .
41001018	And anoon thei leften the nettis , and sueden hym .
41001019	And he yede forth fro thennus a litil , and siy James of Zebedee , and Joon , his brother , in a boot makynge nettis .
41001020	And anoon he clepide hem ; and thei leften Zebedee , her fadir , in the boot with hiryd seruauntis , and thei suweden hym .
41001021	And thei entriden in to Capharnaum , and anoon in the sabatys he yede in to a synagoge , and tauyte hem .
41001022	And thei wondriden on his teching ; for he tauyte hem , as he that hadde power , and not as scribis .
41001023	And in the synagoge of hem was a man in an vnclene spirit , and he criede out ,
41001024	and seide , What to vs and to thee , thou Jhesu of Nazareth ? hast thou come to distrie vs ? Y woot that thou art the hooli of God .
41001025	And Jhesus thretenede hym , and seide , Wex doumbe , and go out of the man .
41001026	And the vnclene spirit debreidynge hym , and criynge with greet vois , wente out fro hym .
41001027	And alle men wondriden , so that thei souyten with ynne hem silf , and seiden , What thing is this ? what newe doctrine is this ? for in power he comaundith to vnclene spiritis , and thei obeyen to hym .
41001028	And the fame of hym wente forth anoon in to al the cuntree of Galilee .
41001029	And anoon thei yeden out of the synagoge , and camen into the hous of Symount and of Andrewe , with James and Joon .
41001030	And the modir of Symountis wijf lay sijk in fyueris ; and anoon thei seien to hym of hyr .
41001031	And he cam nyy , and areride hir , and whanne he hadde take hir hoond , anoon the feuer lefte hir , and sche seruede hem .
41001032	But whanne the euentid was come , and the sonne was gon doun , thei brouyten to hym alle that weren of male ese , and hem that hadden fendis .
41001033	And al the citee was gaderid at the yate .
41001034	And he heelide many , that hadden dyuerse sijknessis , and he castide out many feendis , and he suffride hem not to speke , for thei knewen hym .
41001035	And he roos ful eerli , and yede out , and wente in to a desert place , and preiede there .
41001036	And Symount suede hym , and thei that weren with hym .
41001037	And whanne thei hadden founde hym , thei seiden to hym , That alle men seken thee .
41001038	And he seide to hem , Go we in to the next townes and citees , that Y preche also there , for her to Y cam .
41001039	And he prechide in the synagogis of hem , and in al Galilee , and castide out feendis .
41001040	And a leprouse man cam to hym , and bisouyte , ` and knelide , and seide , If thou wolt , thou maist clense me .
41001041	And Jhesus hadde mercy on hym , and streiyte out his hoond , and towchyde hym , and seide to hym , I wole , be thou maad cleene .
41001042	And whanne he hadde seide this , anoon the lepre partyde awey fro hym , and he was clensyd .
41001043	And Jhesus thretenede hym , and anoon Jhesus putte hym out ,
41001044	and seyde to hym , Se thou , seye to no man ; but go , schewe thee to the pryncys of prestys , and offre for thi clensynge in to wytnessyng to hem , tho thingis that Moyses bad .
41001045	And he yede out , and bigan to preche , and publische the word , so that now he myyte not go opynli in to the citee , but be withoutforth in desert placis ; and thei camen to hym on alle sidis .
41002001	And eft he entride in to Cafarnaum , aftir eiyte daies .
41002002	And it was herd , that he was in an hous , and many camen to gidir , so that thei miyten not be in the hous , ne at the yate . And he spak to hem the word .
41002003	And there camen to hym men that brouyten a man sijk in palesie , which was borun of foure .
41002004	And whanne thei myyten not brynge hym to Jhesu for the puple , thei vnhileden the roof where he was , and openede it , and thei leten doun the bed in which the sijk man in palesie laye .
41002005	And whanne Jhesus hadde seyn the feith of hem , he seide to the sijk man in palesie , Sone , thi synnes ben foryouun to thee .
41002006	But there weren summe of the scribis sittynge , and thenkynge in her hertis ,
41002007	What spekith he thus ? He blasfemeth ; who may foryyue synnes , but God aloone ?
41002008	And whanne Jhesus hadde knowe this bi the Hooli Goost , that thei thouyten so with ynne hem silf , he seith to hem , What thenken ye these thingis in youre hertis ?
41002009	What is liyter to seie to the sijk man in palesie , Synnes ben foryouun to thee , or to seie , Ryse , take thi bed , and walke ?
41002010	But that ye wite that mannus sone hath power in erthe to foryyue synnes , he seide to the sijk man in palesie , Y seie to thee ,
41002011	ryse vp , take thi bed , and go in to thin hous .
41002012	And anoon he roos vp , and whanne he hadde take the bed , he wente bifor alle men , so that alle men wondriden , and onoureden God , and seiden , For we seien neuer so .
41002013	And he wente out eftsoone to the see , and al the puple cam to hym ; and he tauyte hem .
41002014	And whanne he passide , he saiy Leuy ` of Alfei sittynge at the tolbothe , and he seide to hym , Sue me . And he roos , and suede hym .
41002015	And it was doon , whanne he sat at the mete in his hous , many pupplicans and synful men saten togidere at the mete with Jhesu and hise disciplis ; for there weren many that folewiden hym .
41002016	And scribis and Farisees seynge , that he eet with pupplicans and synful men , seiden to hise disciplis , Whi etith and drynkith youre maystir with pupplicans and synneris ?
41002017	Whanne this was herd , Jhesus seide to hem , Hoole men han no nede to a leche , but thei that ben yuel at eese ; for Y cam not to clepe iust men , but synneris .
41002018	And the disciplis of Joon and the Farisees weren fastynge ; and thei camen , and seien to hym , Whi fasten the disciplis of Joon , and the Farisees fasten , but thi disciplis fasten not ?
41002019	And Jhesus seide to hem , Whether the sones of sposailis moun faste , as longe as the spouse is with hem ? As long tyme as thei haue the spouse with hem , thei moun not faste .
41002020	But daies schulen come , whanne the spouse schal be takun awei fro hem , and thanne thei schulen faste in tho daies .
41002021	No man sewith a patche of newe clooth to an elde clooth , ellis he takith awei the newe patche fro the elde , and a more brekyng is maad .
41002022	And no man puttith newe wyn in to elde botelis , ellis the wyn schal breste the botels , and the wyn schal be sched out , and the botels schulen perische . But newe wyn schal be put into newe botels .
41002023	And it was doon eftsoones , whanne the Lord walkid in the sabotis bi the cornes , and hise disciplis bigunnen to passe forth , and plucke eeris of the corn .
41002024	And the Farisees seiden to hym , Lo ! what thi disciplis doon in sabotis , that is not leeueful .
41002025	And he seide to hem , Radden ye neuer what Dauid dide , whanne he hadde nede , and he hungride , and thei that weren with hym ?
41002026	Hou he wente in to the hous of God , vndur Abiathar , prince of prestis , and eete looues of proposicioun , which it was not leeueful to ete , but to preestis aloone , and he yaf to hem that weren with hym .
41002027	And he seide to hem , The sabat is maad for man , and not a man for the sabat ;
41002028	and so mannus sone is lord also of the sabat .
41003001	And he entride eftsoone in to the synagoge , and there was a man hauynge a drye hoond .
41003002	And thei aspieden hym , if he helide in the sabatis , to accuse him .
41003003	And he seide to the man that hadde a drie hoond , Rise in to the myddil .
41003004	And he seith to hem , Is it leeueful to do wel in the sabatis , ether yuel ? to make a soul saaf , ether to leese ? And thei weren stille .
41003005	And he biheeld hem aboute with wraththe , and hadde sorewe on the blyndnesse of her herte , and seith to the man , Hold forth thin hoond . And he helde forth , and his hoond was restorid to hym .
41003006	Sotheli Farisees yeden out anoon , and maden a counsel with Erodians ayens hym , hou thei schulden lese hym .
41003007	But Jhesus with hise disciplis wente to the see ; and myche puple fro Galilee and Judee suede hym ,
41003008	and fro Jerusalem , and fro Ydume , and fro biyondis Jordan , and thei that weren aboute Tire and Sidon , a greet multitude , heringe the thingis that he dide , and cam to hym .
41003009	And Jhesus seide to hise disciplis , that the boot schulde serue hym , for the puple , lest thei thristen hym ;
41003010	for he heelide many , so that thei felden fast to hym , to touche hym . And hou many euer hadde syknessis , and vnclene spirits ,
41003011	whanne thei seyen hym , felden doun to hym , and crieden , seiynge , Thou art the sone of God .
41003012	And greetli he manasside hem , that thei schulden not make hym knowun .
41003013	And he wente in to an hille , and clepide to hym whom he wolde ; and thei camen to hym .
41003014	And he made , that there weren twelue with hym , to sende hem to preche .
41003015	And he yaf to hem pouwer to heele sijknessis , and to caste out feendis .
41003016	And to Symount he yaf a name Petre , and he clepide James of Zebede and Joon ,
41003017	the brother of James , and he yaf to hem names Boenarges , that is , sones of thundryng .
41003018	And he clepide Andrew and Filip , and Bartholomew and Matheu , and Thomas and James Alfey , and Thadee ,
41003019	and Symount Cananee , and Judas Scarioth , that bitraiede hym .
41003020	And thei camen to an hous , and the puple cam togidere eftsoone , so that thei miyten not ete breed .
41003021	And whanne his kynnysmen hadden herd , thei wenten out ` to holde him ; for thei seiden , that he is turned in to woodnesse .
41003022	And the scribis that camen doun fro Jerusalem , seiden , That he hath Belsabub , and that in the prince of deuelis he castith out fendis .
41003023	And he clepide hem togidir , and he seide to hem in parablis , Hou may Sathanas caste out Sathanas ?
41003024	And if a rewme be departid ayens it silf , thilke rewme may not stonde .
41003025	And if an hous be disparpoilid on it silf , thilke hous may not stonde .
41003026	And if Sathanas hath risun ayens hym silf , he is departid , and he schal not mowe stonde , but hath an ende .
41003027	No man may go in to a stronge mannus hous , and take awey hise vessels , but he bynde first the stronge man , and thanne he schal spoile his hous .
41003028	Treuli Y seie to you , that alle synnes and blasfemyes , bi whiche thei han blasfemed , schulen be foryouun to the sones of men .
41003029	But he that blasfemeth ayens the Hooli Goost , hath not remissioun in to with outen ende , but he schal be gilty of euerlastynge trespas .
41003030	For thei seiden , He hath an vnclene spirit .
41003031	And his modir and britheren camen , and thei stoden withoutforth , and senten to hym , and clepiden hym .
41003032	And the puple sat aboute hym ; and thei seien to hym , Lo ! thi modir and thi britheren with outforth seken thee .
41003033	And he answeride to hem , and seide , Who is my modir and my britheren ?
41003034	And he bihelde thilke that saten aboute hym , and seide , Lo ! my modir and my britheren .
41003035	For who that doith the wille of God , he is my brothir , and my sistir , and modir .
41004001	And eft Jhesus bigan to teche at the see ; and myche puple was gaderid to hym , so that he wente in to a boot , and sat in the see , and al the puple was aboute the see on the loond .
41004002	And he tauyte hem in parablis many thingis . And he seide to hem in his techyng ,
41004003	Here ye . Lo ! a man sowynge goith out to sowe .
41004004	And the while he sowith , summe seed felde aboute the weie , and briddis of heuene camen , and eeten it .
41004005	Othere felde doun on stony places , where it had not myche erthe ; and anoon it spronge vp , for it had not depnesse of erthe .
41004006	And whanne the sunne roos vp , it welewide for heete , and it driede vp , for it hadde no roote .
41004007	And othere felde doun in to thornes , and thornes sprongen vp , and strangliden it , and it yaf not fruyt .
41004008	And other felde doun in to good loond , and yaf fruyt , springynge vp , and wexynge ; and oon brouyte thretti foold , and oon sixti fold , and oon an hundrid fold .
41004009	And he seide , He that hath eeris of heryng , here he .
41004010	And whanne he was bi hym silf , tho twelue that weren with hym axiden hym to expowne the parable .
41004011	And he seide to hem , To you it is youun to knowe the priuete of the kyngdom of God . But to hem that ben with outforth , alle thingis be maad in parablis , that thei seynge se ,
41004012	and se not , and thei herynge here and vnderstonde not ; lest sum tyme thei be conuertid , and synnes be foryouun to hem .
41004013	And he seide to hem , Knowe not ye this parable ? and hou ye schulen knowe alle parablis ?
41004014	He that sowith , sowith a word .
41004015	But these it ben that ben aboute the weie , where the word is sowun ; and whanne thei han herd , anoon cometh Satanas , and takith awei the word that is sowun in her hertis .
41004016	And in lijk maner ben these that ben sowun on stony placis , whiche whanne thei han herd the word , anoon thei taken it with ioye ;
41004017	and thei han not roote in hem silf , but thei ben lastynge a litil tyme ; aftirward whanne tribulacioun risith , and persecucioun for the word , anoon thei ben sclaundrid .
41004018	And ther ben othir that ben sowun in thornes ; these it ben that heren the word ,
41004019	and disese of the world , and disseit of ritchessis , and othir charge of coueytise entrith , and stranglith the word , and it is maad with out fruyt .
41004020	And these it ben that ben sowun on good lond , whiche heren the word , and taken , and maken fruyt , oon thritti fold , oon sixti fold , and oon an hundrid fold .
41004021	And he seide to hem , Wher a lanterne cometh , that it be put vndur a buschel , or vndur a bed ? nay , but that it be put on a candilstike ?
41004022	Ther is no thing hid , that schal not be maad opyn ; nethir ony thing is pryuey , that schal not come in to opyn .
41004023	If ony man haue eeris of heryng , here he .
41004024	And he seide to hem , Se ye what ye heren . In what mesure ye meten , it schal be metun to you ayen , and be cast to you .
41004025	For it schal be youun to hym that hath , and it schal be takun awei fro him that hath not , also that that he hath .
41004026	And he seide , So the kingdom of God is , as if a man caste seede in to the erthe ,
41004027	and he sleepe , and it rise up niyt and dai , and brynge forth seede , and wexe faste , while he woot not .
41004028	For the erthe makith fruyt , first the gras , aftirward the ere , and aftir ful fruyt in the ere .
41004029	And whanne of it silf it hath brouyt forth fruyt , anoon he sendith a sikil , for repyng tyme is come .
41004030	And he seide , To what thing schulen we likne the kyngdom of God ? or to what parable schulen we comparisoun it ?
41004031	As a corne of seneuei , which whanne it is sowun in the erthe , is lesse than alle seedis that ben in the erthe ;
41004032	and whanne it is sprongun up , it waxith in to a tre , and is maad gretter than alle erbis ; and it makith grete braunchis , so that briddis of heuene moun dwelle vndur the schadewe therof .
41004033	And in many suche parablis he spak to hem the word , as thei myyten here ;
41004034	and he spak not to hem with out parable . But he expownede to hise disciplis alle thingis bi hemsilf .
41004035	And he seide to hem in that dai , whanne euenyng was come , Passe we ayenward .

41007006	And he answeride , and seide to hem , Ysaie prophesiede wel of you , ypocritis , as it is writun , This puple worschipith me with lippis , but her herte is fer fro me ;
41007007	and in veyn thei worschipen me , techinge the doctrines and the heestis of men .

41007020	But he seide , The thingis that gon out of a man , tho defoulen a man .

41007027	And he seide to hir , Suffre thou , that the children be fulfillid first ; for it is not good to take the breed of children , and yyue to houndis .
41007028	And sche answeride , and seide to him , Yis , Lord ; for litil whelpis eten vndur the bord , of the crummes of children .
41007029	And Jhesus seide to hir , Go thou , for this word the feend wente out of thi douytir .
41007030	And whanne sche was gon in to hir hous home , sche foonde the damysel ligynge on the bed , and the deuel gon out fro hir .

41007035	And anoon hise eris weren openyd , and the boond of his tunge was vnboundun , and he spak riytli .
41007036	And he comaundide to hem , that thei schulden seie to no man ; but hou myche he comaundide to hem , so myche more thei prechiden ,
41007037	and bi so myche more thei wondriden , and seiden , He dide wel alle thingis , and he made deef men to here , and doumbe men to speke .
41008001	In tho daies eft , whanne myche puple was with Jhesu , and hadden not what thei schulden ete , whanne hise disciplis weren clepid togidir ,
41008002	he seide to hem , I haue reuth on the puple , for lo ! now the thridde dai thei abiden me , and han not what to ete ;
41008003	and if Y leeue hem fastynge in to her hous , thei schulen faile in the weie ; for summe of hem camen fro fer .
41008004	And hise disciplis answerden to hym , Wherof schal a man mowe fille hem with looues here in wildirnesse ?
41008005	And he axide hem , Hou many looues han ye ?
41008006	Whiche seiden , Seuene . And he comaundide the puple to sitte doun on the erthe . And he took the seuene looues , and dide thankyngis , and brak , and yaf to hise disciplis , that thei schulden sette forth . And thei settiden forth to the puple .
41008007	And thei hadden a few smale fischis ; and he blesside hem , and comaundide , that thei weren sette forth .
41008008	And thei eten , and weren fulfillid ; and thei token vp that that lefte of relifs , seuene lepis .

41008012	And he sorewynge ` with ynne in spirit , seide , What sekith this generacioun a tokne ? Treuli Y seie to you , a tokene schal not be youun to this generacioun .
41008013	And he lefte hem , and wente vp eftsoone in to a boot , and wente ouer the see .
41008014	And thei foryaten to take breed , and thei hadden not with hem but o loof in the boot .
41008015	And he comaundide hem , and seide , Se ye , and ` be war of the sowre dowy of Farisees , and of the sowrdowy of Eroude .
41008016	And thei thouyten , and seiden oon to anothir , For we han not looues .
41008017	And whanne this thing was knowun , Jhesus seide to hem , What thenken ye , for ye han not looues ? Yit ye knowun not , ne vndurstonden ; yit ye han youre herte blyndid .
41008018	Ye hauynge iyen , seen not , and ye hauynge eeris , heren not ; nethir ye han mynde ,

41008029	Thanne he seith to hem , But whom seien ye that Y am ? Petre answeride , and seide to hym , Thou art Crist .
41008030	And he chargide hem , that thei schulden not seie of hym to ony man .
41008031	And he bigan to teche hem , that it bihoueth mannus sone to suffre many thingis , and to be repreued of the elder men , and of the hiyest prestis , and the scribis , and to be slayn , and aftir thre dayes , to rise ayen .
41008032	And he spak pleynli the word . And Peter took hym , and bigan to blame hym , and seide , Lord , be thou merciful to thee , for this schal not be .
41008033	And he turnede , and saiy hise disciplis , and manasside Petir , and seide , Go after me , Satanas ; for thou sauerist not tho thingis that ben of God , but tho thingis that ben of men .
41008034	And whanne the puple was clepid togidere , with hise disciplis , he seide to hem , If ony man wole come after me , denye he hym silf , and take his cros , and sue he me .
41008035	For he that wole make saaf his lijf , schal leese it ; and he that leesith his lijf for me , and for the gospel , schal make it saaf .
41008036	For what profitith it to a man , if he wynne al the world , and do peiryng to his soule ?
41008037	or what chaunging schal a man yyue for his soule ?
41008038	But who that knoulechith me and my wordis in this generacioun avowtresse and synful , also mannus sone schal knouleche him , whanne he schal come in the glorie of his fadir , with his aungels .
41009001	And he seide to hem , Treuli Y seie to you , that there ben summen stondynge here , whiche schulen not taste deth , til thei seen the rewme of God comynge in vertu .
41009002	And aftir sixe daies Jhesus took Petre , and James , and Joon , and ledde hem bi hem silf aloone in to an hiy hille ; and he was transfigurid bifor hem .
41009003	And hise clothis weren maad ful schynynge and white as snow , whiche maner white clothis a fuller may not make on erthe .
41009004	And Helie with Moises apperide to hem , and thei spaken with Jhesu .
41009005	And Petre answeride , and seide to Jhesu , Maister , it is good vs to be here ; and make we here thre tabernaclis , oon to thee , oon to Moyses , and oon to Helie .
41009006	For he wiste not what he schulde seie ; for thei weren agaste bi drede .
41009007	And ther was maad a cloude overschadewynge hem ; and a vois cam of the cloude , and seide , This is my moost derworth sone , here ye hym .
41009008	And anoon thei bihelden aboute , and sayn no more ony man , but Jhesu oonli with hem .
41009009	And whanne thei camen doun fro the hille , he comaundide hem , that thei schulden not telle to ony man tho thingis that thei hadden seen , but whanne mannus sone hath risun ayen fro deeth .
41009010	And thei helden the word at hem silf , sekynge what this schulde be , whanne he hadde risun ayen fro deth .
41009011	And thei axiden hym , and seiden , What thanne seien Farisees and scribis , for it bihoueth ` Helie to come first .
41009012	And he answeride , and seide to hem , Whanne Helie cometh , he schal first restore alle thingis ; and as it is writun of mannus sone , that he suffre many thingis , and be dispisid .
41009013	And Y seie to you , that Helie is comun , and thei diden to hym what euer thingis thei wolden , as it is writun of hym .
41009014	And he comynge to hise disciplis , saiy a greet cumpany aboute hem , and scribis disputynge with hem .
41009015	And anoon al the puple seynge Jhesu , was astonyed , and thei dredden ; and thei rennynge gretten hym .
41009016	And he axide hem , What disputen ye among you ?
41009017	And oon of the cumpany answerde , and seide , Mayster , Y haue brouyt to thee my sone , that hath a doumbe spirit ; and where euer he takith hym ,
41009018	he hurtlith hym doun , and he fometh , and betith togidir with teeth , and wexith drye . And Y seide to thi disciplis , that thei schulden caste hym out , and thei myyten not .
41009019	And he answeride to hem , and seide , A ! thou generacioun out of bileue , hou longe schal Y be among you , hou longe schal Y suffre you ? Brynge ye hym to me .
41009020	And thei brouyten hym . And whanne he had seyn him , anoon the spirit troublide him ; and was throw doun to grounde , and walewide , and fomede .
41009021	And he axide his fadir , Hou longe ` is it , sith this ` hath falle to hym ? And he seide , Fro childhode ;
41009022	and ofte he hath put hym in to fier , and in to watir , to leese hym ; but if thou maiste ony thing , helpe vs , and haue merci on vs .
41009023	And Jhesus seide to hym , If thou maiste bileue , alle thingis ben possible to man that bileueth .
41009024	And anoon the fadir of the child criede with teeris , and seide , Lord , Y bileue ; Lord , helpe thou myn vnbileue .
41009025	And whanne Jhesus hadde seyn the puple rennynge togidere , he manasside the vnclene spirit , and seide to hym , Thou deef and doumbe spirit , Y comaunde thee , go out fro hym , and entre no more in to hym .
41009026	And he criynge , and myche to breidynge him , wente out fro hym ; and he was maad as deed , so that many seiden , that he was deed .
41009027	And Jhesus helde his hoond , and lifte hym vp ; and he roos .
41009028	And whanne he hadde entrid in to an hous , hise disciplis axiden hym priueli , Whi myyten not we caste hym out ?
41009029	And he seide to hem , This kynde in no thing may go out , but in preier and fastyng .
41009030	And thei yeden fro thennus , and wente forth in to Galile ; and thei wolden not , that ony man wiste .
41009031	And he tauyte hise disciplis , and seide to hem , For mannus sone schal be bitrayed in to the hondis of men , and thei schulen sle hym , and he slayn schal ryse ayen on the thridde day .
41009032	And thei knewen not the word , and dredden to axe hym .
41009033	And thei camen to Cafarnaum . And whanne thei weren in the hous , he axide hem , What tretiden ye in the weie ?
41009034	And thei weren stille ; for thei disputiden among hem in the weie , who of hem schulde be grettest .
41009035	And he sat , and clepide the twelue , and seide to hem , If ony man wole be the firste among you , he schal be the laste of alle , and the mynyster of alle .
41009036	And he took a child , and sette hym in the myddil of hem ; and whanne he hadde biclippid hym , he seide to hem ,
41009037	Who euer resseyueth oon of such children in my name , he resseyueth me ; and who euer resseyueth me , he resseyueth not me aloone , but hym that sente me .
41009038	Joon answeride to hym , and seide , Maister , we sayn oon castynge out feendis in thi name , which sueth not vs , and we han forbodun hym .
41009039	And Jhesus seide , Nyle ye forbede him ; for ther is no man that doith vertu in my name , and may soone speke yuel of me .
41009040	He that is not ayens vs , is for vs .
41009041	And who euer yyueth you a cuppe of coold water to drynke in my name , for ye ben of Crist , treuli Y seie to you , he schal not leese his mede .
41009042	And who euer schal sclaundre oon of these litle that bileuen in me , it were betere to hym that a mylne stoon ` of assis were don aboute his necke , and he were cast in to the see .
41009043	And if thin hoond sclaundre thee , kitte it awey ; it is betere to thee to entre feble in to lijf , than haue two hondis , and go in to helle , in to fier that neuer schal be quenchid ,
41009044	where the worm of hem dieth not , and the fier is not quenchid .
41009045	And if thi foote sclaundre thee , kitte it of ; it is betere to thee to entre crokid in to euerlastynge lijf , than haue twei feet , and be sent in to helle of fier , that neuer schal be quenchid ,
41009046	where the worme of hem dieth not , and the fier is not quenchid .
41009047	That if thin iye sclaundre thee , cast it out ; it is betere to thee to entre gogil iyed in to the reume of God , than haue twey iyen , and be sent in to helle of fier , where the worme of hem dieth not ,
41009048	and the fier is not quenchid .
41009049	And euery man schal be saltid with fier , and euery slayn sacrifice schal be maad sauery with salt .
41009050	Salt is good ; if salt be vnsauery , in what thing schulen ye make it sauery ? Haue ye salt among you , and haue ye pees among you .
41010001	And Jhesus roos vp fro thennus , and cam in to the coostis of Judee ouer Jordan ; and eftsoones the puple cam togidere to hym , and as he was wont , eftsoone he tauyte hem .
41010002	And the Farisees camen , and axiden hym , Whether it be leueful to a man to leeue his wijf ? and thei temptiden hym .
41010003	And he answeride , and seide to hem , What comaundide Moises to you ?
41010004	And thei seiden , Moises suffride to write a libel of forsaking , and to forsake .
41010005	` To whiche Jhesus answeride , and seide , For the hardnesse of youre herte Moises wroot to you this comaundement .
41010006	But fro the bigynnyng of creature God made hem male and female ;
41010007	and seide , For this thing a man schal leeue his fadir and modir ,
41010008	and schal drawe to hys wijf , and thei schulen be tweyne in o flesch . And so now thei ben not tweyne , but o flesch .
41010009	Therfor that thing that God ioynede togidere , no man departe .
41010010	And eftsoone in the hous hise disciplis axiden hym of the same thing .
41010011	And he seide to hem , Who euer leeuith his wijf , and weddith another , he doith auowtri on hir .
41010012	And if the wijf leeue hir housebonde , and be weddid to another man , sche doith letcherie .
41010013	And thei brouyten to hym litle children , that he schulde touche hem ; and the disciplis threteneden the men , that brouyten hem .
41010014	And whanne Jhesus hadde seyn hem , he baar heuy , and seide to hem , Suffre ye litle children to come to me , and forbede ye hem not , for of suche is the kyngdom of God .
41010015	Treuli Y seie to you , who euer resseyueth not the kyngdom of God as a litil child , he schal not entre in to it .
41010016	And he biclippide hem , and leide hise hondis on hem , and blisside hem .
41010017	And whanne Jhesus was gon out in the weie , a man ranne bifore , and knelide bifor hym , and preiede hym , and seide , Good maister , what schal Y do , that Y resseyue euerlastynge lijf ?
41010018	And Jhesus seide to hym , What seist thou , that Y am good ? Ther is no man good , but God hym silf .
41010019	Thou knowist the comaundementis , do thou noon auowtrie , ` sle not , stele not , seie not fals witnessyng , do no fraude , worschipe thi fadir and thi modir .
41010020	And he answeride , and seide to hym , Maister , Y haue kept alle these thingis fro my yongthe .
41010021	And Jhesus bihelde hym , and louede hym , and seide to hym , O thing faileth to thee ; go thou , and sille alle thingis that thou hast , and yyue to pore men , and thou schalt haue tresoure in heuene ; and come , sue thou me .
41010022	And he was ful sori in the word , and wente awei mornyng , for he hadde many possessiouns .
41010023	And Jhesus bihelde aboute , and seide to hise disciplis , Hou hard thei that han ritchessis schulen entre in to the kyngdom of God .
41010024	And the disciplis weren astonyed in hise wordis . And Jhesus eftsoone answeride , and seide ` to hem , Ye litle children , hou hard it is for men that tristen in ritchessis to entre in to the kyngdom of God .
41010025	It is liyter a camele to passe thorou a nedlis iye , than a riche man to entre in to the kyngdom of God .
41010026	And thei wondriden more , and seiden among hem silf , And who may be sauyd ?
41010027	And Jhesus bihelde hem , and seide , Anentis men it is impossible , but not anentis God ; for alle thingis ben possible anentis God .
41010028	And Petir bigan to seie to hym , Lo ! we han left alle thingis , and han sued thee .
41010029	Jhesus answeride , and seide , Treuli Y seie to you , ther is no man that leeueth hous , or britheren , or sistris , or fadir , or modir , or children , or feeldis for me and for the gospel ,
41010030	which schal not take an hundrid fold so myche now in this tyme , housis , and britheren , and sistris , and modris , and children , and feeldis , with persecuciouns , and in the world to comynge euerlastynge lijf .
41010031	But many schulen be , the firste the last , and the last the firste .
41010032	And thei weren in the weie goynge vp to Jerusalem ; and Jhesus wente bifor hem , and thei wondriden , and foleweden , and dredden . And eftsoone Jhesus took the twelue , and bigan to seie to hem , what thingis weren to come to hym .
41010033	For lo ! we stien to Jerusalem , and mannus sone schal be bitraied to the princis of prestis , and to scribis , and to the eldre men ; and thei schulen dampne hym bi deth , and thei schulen take hym to hethene men . And thei schulen scorne hym ,
41010034	and bispete hym , and bete him ; and thei schulen sle hym , and in the thridde dai he schal rise ayen .
41010035	And James and Joon , Zebedees sones , camen to hym , and seiden , Maister , we wolen , that what euer we axen , thou do to vs .
41010036	And he seide to hem , What wolen ye that Y do to you ?
41010037	And thei seiden , Graunte to vs , that we sitten ` the toon at thi riythalf , and the tother at thi left half , in thi glorie .
41010038	And Jhesus seide to hem , Ye witen not what ye axen ; moun ye drynke the cuppe , which Y schal drynke , or be waischun with the baptym , in which Y am baptisid ?
41010039	And thei seiden to hym , We moun . And Jhesus seide to hem , Ye schulen drynke the cuppe that Y drynke , and ye schulen be waschun with the baptym , in which Y am baptisid ;
41010040	but to sitte at my riythalf or lefthalf is not myn to yyue to you , but to whiche it is maad redi .
41010041	And the ten herden , and bigunnen to haue indignacioun of James and Joon .
41010042	But Jhesus clepide hem , and seide to hem , Ye witen , that thei that semen to haue prynshode of folkis , ben lordis of hem , and the princes of hem han power of hem .
41010043	But it is not so among you , but who euer wole be maad gretter , schal be youre mynyster ;
41010044	and who euer wole be the firste among you , schal be seruaunt of alle .
41010045	For whi mannus sone cam not , that it schulde be mynystrid to hym , but that he schulde mynystre , and yyue his lijf ayenbiyng for manye .
41010046	And thei camen to Jerico ; and whanne he yede forth fro Jerico , and hise disciplis , and a ful myche puple , Barthymeus , a blynde man , the sone of Thimei , sat bisidis the weie , and beggide .
41010047	And whanne he herde , that it is Jhesus of Nazareth , he bigan to crie , and seie , Jhesu , the sone of Dauid , haue merci on me .
41010048	And manye thretneden hym , that he schulde be stille ; and he criede myche the more , Jhesu , the sone of Dauid , haue merci on me .
41010049	And Jhesus stood , and comaundide hym to be clepid ; and thei clepen the blynde man , and seien to hym , Be thou of betere herte , rise vp , he clepith thee .
41010050	And he castide awei his cloth , and skippide , and cam to hym .
41010051	And Jhesus answeride , and seide to hym , What wolt thou , that Y schal do to thee ? The blynde man seide to hym , Maister , that Y se .
41010052	Jhesus seide to hym , Go thou , thi feith hath maad thee saaf . And anoon he saye , and suede hym in the weie .
41011001	And whanne Jhesus cam nyy to Jerusalem and to Betanye , to the mount of Olyues , he sendith tweyne of hise disciplis , and seith to hem ,
41011002	Go ye in to the castel that is ayens you ; and anoon as ye entren there ye schulen fynde a colt tied , on which no man hath sete yit ; vntie ye , and brynge hym .
41011003	And if ony man seye ony thing to you , What doen ye ? seie ye , that he is nedeful to the Lord , and anoon he schal leeue hym hidir .
41011004	And thei yeden forth , and founden a colt tied bifor the yate with out forth , in the metyng of twei weies ; and thei vntieden hym .
41011005	And summe of hem that stoden there seiden to hem , What doen ye , vntiynge the colt ?
41011006	And thei seiden to hem , as Jhesus comaundide hem ; and thei leften it to hem .
41011007	And thei brouyten the colt to Jhesu , and thei leiden on hym her clothis , and Jhesus sat on hym .
41011008	And many strewiden her clothis in the weie , othere men kittiden braunchis fro trees , and strewiden in the weie .
41011009	And thei that wenten bifor , and that sueden , crieden , and seiden , Osanna ,
41011010	blissid is he that cometh in the name of the Lord ; blessid be the kyngdom of oure fadir Dauid that is come ; Osanna in hiyest thingis .
41011011	And he entride in to Jerusalem , in to the temple ; and whanne he ` hadde seyn al thing aboute , whanne it was eue , he wente out in to Betanye , with the twelue .
41011012	And anothir daye , whanne he wente out of Betanye , he hungride .
41011013	And whanne he hadde seyn a fige tree afer hauynge leeues , he cam , if happili he schulde fynde ony thing theron ; and whanne he cam to it , he foonde no thing , out takun leeues ; for it was not tyme of figis .
41011014	And Jhesus answeride and seide to it , Now neuer ete ony man fruyt of thee more . And hise disciplis herden ;
41011015	and thei camen to Jerusalem . And whanne he was entrid in to the temple , he bigan to caste out silleris and biggeris in the temple ; and he turnede vpsodoun the bordis of chaungeris , and the chayeris of men that selden culueris ;
41011016	and he suffride not , that ony man schulde bere a vessel thorou the temple .
41011017	And he tauyte hem , and seide , Whether it is not writun , That myn hous schal be clepid the hous of preyng to alle folkis ? but ye han maad it a denne of theues .
41011018	And whanne this thing was herd , the princis of prestis and scribis souyten hou thei schulden leese hym ; for thei dredden hym , for al the puple wondride on his techyng .
41011019	And whanne euenyng was come , he wente out of the citee .
41011020	And as thei passiden forth eerli , thei sayn the fige tree maad drye fro the rootis .
41011021	And Petir bithouyte hym , and seide to hym , Maister , lo ! the fige tree , whom thou cursidist , is dried vp .
41011022	And Jhesus answeride and seide to hem , Haue ye the feith of God ;
41011023	treuli Y seie to you , that who euer seith to this hil , Be thou takun , and cast in to the see ; and doute not in his herte , but bileueth , that what euer he seie , schal be don , it schal be don to hym .
41011024	Therfor Y seie to you , alle thingis what euer thingis ye preynge schulen axe , bileue ye that ye schulen take , and thei schulen come to you .
41011025	And whanne ye schulen stonde to preye , foryyue ye , if ye han ony thing ayens ony man , that youre fadir that is in heuenes , foryyue to you youre synnes .
41011026	And if ye foryyuen not , nether youre fadir that is in heuenes , schal foryyue to you youre synnes .
41011027	And eftsoone thei camen to Jerusalem . And whanne he walkide in the temple , the hiyeste prestis , and scribis , and the elder men camen to hym ,
41011028	and seyn to hym , In what power doist thou these thingis ? or who yaf to thee this power , that thou do these thingis ?
41011029	Jhesus answeride and seide to hem , And Y schal axe you o word , and answere ye to me , and Y schal seie to you in what power Y do these thingis .
41011030	Whether was the baptym of Joon of heuene , or of men ? answere ye to me .
41011031	And thei thouyten with ynne hem silf , seiynge , If we seien of heuene , he schal seie to vs , Whi thanne bileuen ye not to him ;
41011032	if we seien of men , we dreden the puple ; for alle men hadden Joon , that he was verili a prophete .
41011033	And thei answeryden , and seien to Jhesu , We witen neuer . And Jhesu answerde , and seide to hem , Nether Y seie to you , in what power Y do these thingis .
41012001	And Jhesus bigan to speke to hem in parablis . A man plauntide a vynyerd , and sette an hegge aboute it , and dalf a lake , and bildide a toure , and hiryde it to tilieris , and wente forth in pilgrimage .
41012002	And he sente to the erthe tilieris in tyme a seruaunt , to resseyue of the erthe tilieris of the fruyt of the vynyerd .
41012003	And thei token hym , and beeten , and leften hym voide .
41012004	And eftsoone he sente to hem anothir seruaunt , and thei woundiden hym in the heed , and turmentiden hym .
41012005	And eftsoone he sente another , and thei slowen hym , and othir mo , betynge summe , and sleynge othere .
41012006	But yit he hadde a moost derworth sone , and he sente hym last to hem , and seide , Perauenture thei schulen drede my sone .
41012007	But the erthetilieris seiden togidere , This is the eire ; come ye , sle we hym , and the eritage schal be ourun .
41012008	And thei tokun hym , and killiden , and castiden out without the vynyerd .
41012009	Thanne what schal the lord of the vynyerd do ? He schal come , and lese the tilieris , and yyue the vynyerd to othere .
41012010	Whether ye han not red this scripture , The stoon which the bilderis han disspisid , this is maad in to the heed of the corner ?
41012011	This thing is doon of the Lord , and is wondirful in oure iyen .
41012012	And thei souyten to holde hym , and thei dredden the puple ; for thei knewen that to hem he seide this parable ; and thei leften hym ,
41012013	and thei wenten awei . And thei senten to hym summe of the Farisees and Erodians , to take hym in word .
41012014	Whiche camen , and seien to hym , Maistir , we witen that thou art sothfast , and reckist not of ony man ; for nethir thou biholdist in to the face of man , but thou techist the weie of God in treuthe . Is it leeueful that tribute be youun to the emperoure , or we schulen not yyue ?
41012015	Which witynge her pryuei falsnesse , seide to hem , What tempten ye me ? brynge ye to me a peny , that Y se .
41012016	And thei brouyten to hym . And he seide to hem , Whos is this ymage , and the writyng ? Thei seien to him , The emperouris .
41012017	And Jhesus answeride and seide to hem , Thanne yelde ye to the emperour tho thingis that ben of the emperours ; and to God tho thingis that ben of God .
41012018	And thei wondriden of hym . And Saduces , that seien that ther is no ressurreccioun , camen to hym , and axeden hym ,
41012019	and seiden , Maister , Moyses wroot to vs , that if the brother of a man were deed , and lefte his wijf , and haue no sones , his brother take his wijf , and reise vp seed to his brother .
41012020	Thanne seuene britheren ther weren ; and the firste took a wijf , and diede , and lefte no seed .
41012021	And the secounde took hir , and he diede , and nether this lefte seed .
41012022	And the thridde also . And in lijk manere the seuene token hir , and leften not seed . And the womman the laste of alle ` is deed .
41012023	Thanne in the resurreccioun , whanne thei schulen rise ayen , whos wijf of these schal sche be ? for seuene hadden hir to wijf .
41012024	And Jhesus answeride , and seide to hem , Whether ye erren not therfor , that ye knowe not scripturis , nethir the vertu of God ?
41012025	For whanne thei schulen rise ayen fro deeth , nether thei schulen wedde , nethir schulen be weddid , but thei schulen be as aungels of God in heuenes .
41012026	And of deed men , that thei risen ayen , han ye not red in the book of Moises , on the buysch , hou God spak to hym , and seide , Y am God of Abraham , and God of Isaac , and God of Jacob ?
41012027	He is not God of deed men , but of lyuynge men ; therfor ye erren myche .
41012028	And oon of the scribis , that hadde herde hem dispuytynge togidir , cam nyy , and saiy that Jhesus had wel answeride hem , and axide hym , which was the firste maundement of alle .
41012029	And Jhesus answeride to him , that the firste maundement of alle is , Here thou , Israel , thi Lord God is o God ;
41012030	and thou schalt loue thi Lord God of al thin herte , and of al thi soule , and of al thi mynde , and of al thi myyt .
41012031	This is the firste maundement . And the secounde is lijk to this , Thou schalt loue thi neiybore as thi silf . Ther is noon other maundement gretter than these .
41012032	And the scribe seide to hym , Maister , in treuthe thou hast wel seid ; for o God is , and ther is noon other , outakun hym ;
41012033	that he be loued of al the herte , and of al the mynde , and of al the vndurstondynge , and of al the soule , and of al strengthe , and to loue the neiybore as hym silf , is gretter than alle brent offryngis and sacrifices .
41012034	And Jhesus seynge that he hadde answerid wiseli , seide to hym , Thou art not fer fro the kyngdom of God .
41012035	And thanne no man durste axe hym no more ony thing . And Jhesus answeride and seide , techynge in the temple , Hou seien scribis , that Crist is the sone of Dauid ?
41012036	For Dauid hym silf seide in the Hooli Goost , the Lord seide to my lord , Sitte on my riythalf , til Y putte thin enemyes the stool of thi feet .
41012037	Thanne Dauid hym silf clepith him lord , hou thanne is he his sone ? And myche puple gladli herde hym .
41012038	And he seide to hem in his techyng , Be ye war of scribis , that wolen wandre in stolis ,
41012039	and be salutid in chepyng , and sitte in synagogis in the firste chaieris , and the firste sittyng placis in soperis ;
41012040	whiche deuouren the housis of widewis vndur colour of long preier ; thei schulen take the longer doom .
41012041	And Jhesus sittynge ayens the tresorie , bihelde hou the puple castide monei in to the tresorie ; and many riche men castiden many thingis .
41012042	But whanne a pore widewe was comun , sche keste two mynutis , that is , a ferthing .
41012043	And he clepide togidere hise disciplis , and seide to hem , Treuli Y seie to you , that this pore widewe keste more thanne alle , that kesten in to the tresorie .
41012044	For alle kesten of that thing that thei hadden plente of ; but this of her pouert keste alle thingis that sche hadde , al hir lyuelode .
41013001	And whanne he wente out of the temple , oon of hise disciplis seide to hym , Maister , biholde , what maner stoonys , and what maner bildyngis .
41013002	And Jhesu answeride , and seide to hym , Seest thou alle these grete bildingis ? ther schal not be left a stoon on a stoon , which schal not be distried .
41013003	And whanne he sat in the mount of Olyues ayens the temple , Petir and James and Joon and Andrew axiden hym bi hem silf ,
41013004	Seie thou to vs , whanne these thingis schulen be don , and what tokene schal be , whanne alle these thingis schulen bigynne to be endid .
41013005	And Jhesus answeride , and bigan to seie to hem , Loke ye , that no man disseyue you ;
41013006	for manye schulen come in my name , seiynge , That Y am ; and thei schulen disseyue manye .
41013007	And whanne ye here batels and opynyouns of batels , drede ye not ; for it bihoueth these thingis to be doon , but not yit anoon is the ende .
41013008	For folk schal rise on folk , and rewme on rewme , and erthe mouyngis and hungur schulen be bi placis ; these thingis schulen be bigynnyngis of sorewis .
41013009	But se ye you silf , for thei schulen take you in counsels , and ye schulen be betun in synagogis ; and ye schulen stonde bifor kyngis and domesmen for me , in witnessyng to hem .
41013010	And it bihoueth , that the gospel be first prechid among al folk .
41013011	And whanne thei taken you , and leden you forth , nyle ye bifore thenke what ye schulen speke , but speke ye that thing that schal be youun to you in that our ; for ye ben not the spekeris , but the Hooli Goost .
41013012	For a brother schal bitake the brother in to deth , and the fadir the sone , and sones schulen rise togider ayens fadris and modris , and punysche hem bi deeth .
41013013	And ye schulen be in hate to alle men for my name ; but he that lastith in to the ende , schal be saaf .
41013014	But whanne ye schulen se the abhomynacioun of discoumfort , stondynge where it owith not ; he that redith , vndurstonde ; thanne thei that be in Judee , fle ` in to hillis .
41013015	And he that is aboue the roof , come not doun in to the hous , nethir entre he , to take ony thing of his hous ;
41013016	and he that schal be in the feeld , turne not ayen bihynde to take his cloth .
41013017	But wo to hem that ben with child , and norischen in tho daies .
41013018	Therfor preye ye , that thei be not don in wyntir .
41013019	But thilke daies of tribulacioun schulen be suche , whiche maner weren not fro the bigynnyng of creature , which God hath maad , til now , nethir schulen be .
41013020	And but the Lord hadde abredgide tho daies , al fleische hadde not be saaf ; but for the chosun whiche he chees , the Lord hath maad schort the daies .
41013021	And thanne if ony man seie to you , Lo ! here is Crist , lo ! there , bileue ye not .
41013022	For false Cristis and false prophetis schulen rise , and schulen yyue tokenes and wondris , to disseyue , if it may be don , yhe , hem that be chosun .
41013023	Therfor take ye kepe ; lo ! Y haue bifor seid to you alle thingis .
41013024	But in tho daies , aftir that tribulacioun , the sunne schal be maad derk , and the moon schal not yyue hir liyt ,
41013025	and the sterris of heuene schulen falle doun , and the vertues that ben in heuenes , schulen be moued .
41013026	And thanne thei schulen se mannus sone comynge in cloudis of heuene , with greet vertu and glorie .
41013027	And thanne he schal sende hise aungelis , and schal geder hise chosun fro the foure wyndis , fro the hiyest thing of erthe til to the hiyest thing of heuene .
41013028	But of the fige tree lerne ye the parable . Whanne now his braunche is tendre , and leeues ben sprongun out , ye knowen that somer is nyy .
41013029	So whanne ye seen these thingis be don , wite ye , that it is nyy in the doris .
41013030	Treuli Y seie to you , that this generacioun schal not passe awei , til alle these thingis be don .
41013031	Heuene and erthe schulen passe , but my wordis schulen not passe .
41013032	But of that dai or our no man woot , nether aungels in heuene , nether the sone , but the fadir .
41013033	Se ye , wake ye , and preie ye ; for ye witen not , whanne the tyme is .
41013034	For as a man that is gon fer in pilgrimage , lefte his hous , and yaf to his seruauntis power of euery work , and comaundide to the porter , that he wake .
41013035	Therfor wake ye , for ye witen not , whanne the lord of the hous cometh , in the euentide , or at mydnyyt , or at cockis crowyng , or in the mornyng ;
41013036	leste whanne he cometh sodenli , he fynde you slepynge .
41013037	Forsothe that that Y seie to you , Y seie to alle , Wake ye .
41014001	Pask and the feest of therf looues was after twei daies . And the hiyest preestis and scribis souyten , hou thei schulden holde hym with gile , and sle .
41014002	But thei seiden , Not in the feeste dai , lest perauenture a noyse were maad among the puple .
41014003	And whanne he was at Betanye , in the hous of Symount leprous , and restide , a womman cam , that hadde a boxe of alabastre of precious oynement spikenard ; and whanne the boxe of alabastre was brokun , sche helde it on his heed .
41014004	But there weren summe that beren it heuyli with ynne hem silf , and seiden , Wher to is this losse of oynement maad ?
41014005	For this oynement myyte haue be seld more than for thre hundrid pens , and be youun to pore men . And thei groyneden ayens hir .
41014006	But Jhesus seide , Suffre ye hir ; what be ye heuy to hir ? sche hath wrouyt a good werk in me .
41014007	For euermore ye schulen haue pore men with you , and whanne ye wolen , ye moun do wel to hem ; but ye schulen not euer more haue me .
41014008	Sche dide that that sche hadde ; sche cam bifore to anoynte my bodi in to biriyng .
41014009	Treuli Y seie to you , where euer this gospel be prechid in al the world , and that that ` this womman hath don , schal be told in to mynde of hym .
41014010	And Judas Scarioth , oon of the twelue , wente to the hiyest prestis , to bitraye hym to hem .
41014011	And thei herden , and ioyeden , and bihiyten to yyue hym money . And he souyt hou he schulde bitraye hym couenabli .
41014012	And the firste dai of therf looues , whanne thei offriden pask , the disciplis seyn to hym , Whidir ` wilt thou that we go , and make redi to thee , that thou ete the pask ?
41014013	And he sendith tweyn of hise disciplis , and seith to hem , Go ye in to the citee , and a man berynge a galoun of watir schal meete you ; sue ye hym .
41014014	And whidur euer he entrith , seie ye to the lord of the hous , That the maister seith , Where is myn etynge place , where Y schal ete pask with my disciplis ?
41014015	And he schal schewe to you a grete soupyng place arayed , and there make ye redi to vs .
41014016	And hise disciplis wenten forth , and camen in to the citee , and founden as he hadde seid to hem ; and thei maden redy the pask .
41014017	And whanne the euentid was come , he cam with the twelue .
41014018	And whanne thei saten ` at the mete , and eeten , Jhesus seide , Treuli Y seie to you , that oon of you that etith with me , schal bitray me .
41014019	And thei bigunnen to be sori , and to seie to hym , ech bi hem silf , Whether Y ?
41014020	Which seide to hem , Oon of twelue that puttith the hoond with me in the platere .
41014021	And sotheli mannus sone goith , as it is writun of hym ; but wo to that man , by whom mannus sone schal be bitrayed . It were good to hym , yf thilke man hadde not be borun .
41014022	And while thei eeten , Jhesus took breed , and blessid , and brak , and yaf to hem , and seide , Take ye ; this is my bodi .
41014023	And whanne he hadde take the cuppe , he dide thankyngis , and yaf to hem , and alle dronken therof .
41014024	And he seide to hem , This is my blood of the newe testament , which schal be sched for many .
41014025	Treuli Y seye to you , for now Y schal not drynke of this fruyt of vyne , in to that dai whane Y schal drynke it newe in the rewme of God .
41014026	And whanne the ympne was seid , thei wenten out in to the hil of Olyues .
41014027	And Jhesus seide to hem , Alle ye schulen be sclaundrid in me in this nyyt ; for it is writun , Y schal smyte the scheepherde , and the scheep of the flok schulen be disparplid .
41014028	But aftir that Y schal rise ayen , Y schal go bifor you in to Galilee .
41014029	And Petir seide to hym , Thouy alle schulen be sclaundrid , but not Y .
41014030	And Jhesus seide to hym , Treuli Y seie to thee , that to dai bifore that the cok in this niyt crowe twies , thou schalt thries denye me .
41014031	But he seide more , Thouy it bihoueth , that Y die togider with thee , Y schal not forsake thee . And in lijk maner alle seiden .
41014032	And thei camen in to a place , whos name is Gethsamany . And he seide to hise disciplis , Sitte ye here , while Y preye .
41014033	And he took Petir and James and Joon with hym , and bigan to drede , and to be anoyed .
41014034	And he seide to hem , My soule is soreweful to the deeth ; abide ye here , and wake ye with me .
41014035	And whanne he was gon forth a litil , he felde doun on the erthe , and preiede , that if it myyte be , that the our schulde passe fro hym .
41014036	And he seide , Abba , fadir , alle thingis ben possible to thee , bere ouer fro me this cuppe ; but not that Y wole , but that thou wolt , be don .
41014037	And he cam , and foond hem slepynge . And he seide to Petir , Symount , slepist thou ? myytist thou not wake with me oon our ?
41014038	Wake ye , and ` preie ye , that ye entre not in to temptacioun ; for the spirit is redi , but the fleische is sijk .
41014039	And eftsoone he yede , and preiede , and seide the same word ;
41014040	and turnede ayen eftsoone , and foond hem slepynge ; for her iyen weren heuyed . And thei knewen not , what thei schulden answere to hym .
41014041	And he cam the thridde tyme , and seide to hem , Slepe ye now , and reste ye ; it suffisith . The hour is comun ; lo ! mannus sone schal be bitraied in to the hondis of synful men .
41014042	Rise ye , go we ; lo ! he that schal bitraye me is nyy .
41014043	And yit while he spak , Judas Scarioth , oon of the twelue , cam , and with him miche puple with swerdis and staues , sent fro the hiyest prestis , and the scribis , and fro the eldre men .
41014044	And his traytour hadde youun to hem a tokene , and seide , Whom euer Y kisse , he it is ; holde ye hym , and lede ye warli .
41014045	And whanne he cam , anoon he came to hym , and seide , Maistir ; and he kisside hym .
41014046	And thei leiden hondis on hym , and helden hym .
41014047	But oon of the men that stoden aboute , drowy out a swerd , and smoot the seruaunt of the hiyest preest , and kittide of his eere .
41014048	And Jhesus answeride , and seide to hem , As to a theef ye han gon out with swerdis and staues , to take me ?
41014049	Dai bi dai Y was among you , and tauyte in the temple , and ye helden not me ; but that the scripturis be fulfillid .
41014050	Thanne alle hise disciplis forsoken hym , and fledden .
41014051	But a yong man , clothid with lynnun cloth on the bare , suede hym ; and thei helden hym .
41014052	And he lefte the lynnyn clothing , and fleiy nakid awei fro hem .
41014053	And thei ledden Jhesu to the hiyest preest . And alle the prestis and scribis and eldere men camen togidir .
41014054	But Petir suede hym afer in to the halle of the hiyest preest . And he sat with the mynystris , and warmede hym at the fier .
41014055	And the hiyest prestis , and al the counsel , souyten witnessyng ayens Jhesu to take hym to the deeth ; but thei founden not .
41014056	For manye seiden fals witnessyng ayens hym , and the witnessyngis weren not couenable .
41014057	And summe risen vp , and baren fals witnessyng ayens hym ,
41014058	and seiden , For we ` han herd hym seiynge , Y schal vndo this temple maad with hondis , and aftir the thridde dai Y schal bilde another not maad with hondis .
41014059	And the witnessyng ` of hem was not couenable .
41014060	And the hiyest prest roos vp in to the myddil , and axide Jhesu , and seide , Answerist thou no thing to tho thingis that ben put ayens thee of these ?
41014061	But he was stille , and answeride no thing . Eftsoone the hiyest prest axide hym , and seide to hym , Art thou Crist , the sone of the blessid God ?
41014062	And Jhesus seide to hym , Y am ; and ye schulen se mannus sone sittynge on the riythalf of the vertu of God , and comynge in the cloudis of heuene .
41014063	And the hiyest preest torente hise clothis , and seide , What yit dissiren we witnessis ?
41014064	Ye han herd blasfemye . What semeth to you ? And thei alle condempneden hym to be gilti of deeth .
41014065	And summe bigunnen to bispete hym , ` and to hile his face , and to smite hym with buffetis , and seie to hym , Areede thou . And the mynystris beeten hym with strokis .
41014066	And whanne Petir was in the halle bynethen , oon of the damesels of the hiyest prest cam .
41014067	And whanne sche hadde seyn Petir warmynge hym , sche bihelde hym , and seide , And thou were with Jhesu of Nazareth .
41014068	And he denyede , and seide , Nethir Y woot , nethir Y knowe , what thou seist . And he wente without forth bifor the halle ; and anoon the cok crewe .
41014069	And eftsoone whanne another damesel hadde seyn hym , sche bigan to seye to men that stoden aboute , That this is of hem .
41014070	And he eftsoone denyede . And aftir a litil , eftsoone thei that stoden nyy , seiden to Petir , Verili thou art of hem , for thou art of Galilee also .
41014071	But he bigan to curse and to swere , For Y knowe not this man , whom ye seien .
41014072	And anoon eftsoones the cok crew . And Petir bithouyte on the word that Jhesus hadde seide to hym , Bifor the cok crowe twies , thries thou schalt denye me . And he bigan to wepe .
41015001	And anoon in the morewtid the hiyeste prestis maden a counsel with the elder men , and the scribis , and with al the counsel , and bounden Jhesu and ledden , and bitoken hym to Pilat .
41015002	And Pilat axide hym , Art thou kynge of Jewis ? And Jhesus answeride , and seide to hym , Thou seist .
41015003	And the hieste prestis accusiden hym in many thingis .
41015004	But Pilat eftsoone axide hym , and seide , Answerist thou no thing ? Seest thou in hou many thingis thei accusen thee ?
41015005	But Jhesus answeride no more , so that Pilat wondride .
41015006	But bi the feeste dai he was wont to leeue to hem oon of men boundun , whom euer thei axiden .
41015007	And ` oon ther was that was seid Barabas , that was boundun with men of dissencioun , that hadden don manslauytir in seducioun .
41015008	And whanne the puple was gon vp , he bigan to preie , as he euer more dide to hem .
41015009	And Pilat answeride ` to hem , and seide , Wolen ye Y leeue to you the kyng of Jewis ?
41015010	For he wiste , that the hiyeste prestis hadden takun hym bi enuye .
41015011	But the bischopis stireden the puple , that he schulde rather leeue to hem Barabas .
41015012	And eftsoone Pilat answerde , and seide to hem , What thanne wolen ye that Y schal do to the kyng of Jewis ?
41015013	And thei eftsoone crieden , Crucifie hym .
41015014	But Pilat seide to hem , What yuel hath he don ? And thei crieden the more , Crucifie hym .
41015015	And Pilat , willynge to make aseeth to the puple , lefte to hem Barabas , and bitok to hem Jhesu , betun with scourgis , to be crucified .
41015016	And knyytis ledden hym with ynneforth , in to the porche of the mote halle . And thei clepiden togidir al the cumpany of knyytis ,
41015017	and clothiden hym with purpur . And thei writhen a coroun of thornes , and puttiden on hym .
41015018	And thei bigunnen to grete hym , and seiden , Heile , thou kyng of Jewis .
41015019	And thei smyten his heed with a reed , and bispatten hym ; and thei kneliden , and worschipiden hym .
41015020	And aftir that thei hadden scorned him , thei vnclothiden hym of purpur , and clothiden hym with hise clothis , and ledden out hym , to crucifie hym .
41015021	And thei compelliden a man that passide the weie , that cam fro the toun , Symount of Syrenen , the fader of Alisaundir and of Rufe , to bere his cross .
41015022	And thei ledden hym in to a place Golgatha , that is to seie , the place of Caluari .
41015023	And thei yauen to hym to drynke wyn meddlid with mirre , and he took not .
41015024	And thei crucifieden him , and departiden hise clothis , and kesten lot on tho , who schulde take what .
41015025	And it was the thridde our , and thei crucifieden hym .
41015026	And the titil of his cause was writun , Kyng of Jewis .
41015027	And thei crucifien with hym twei theues , oon ` at the riythalf and oon at his lefthalf .
41015028	And the scripture was fulfillid that seith , And he is ordeyned with wickid men .
41015029	And as thei passiden forth , thei blasfemyden hym , mouynge her heedis , and seiynge , Vath ! thou that distriest the temple of God , and in ` thre daies bildist it ayen ;
41015030	come adoun fro the crosse , and make thi silf saaf .
41015031	Also the hiyeste prestis scorneden hym ech to othir with the scribis , and seiden , He made othir men saaf , he may not saue hym silf .
41015032	Crist , kyng of Israel , come doun now fro the cross , that we seen , and bileuen . And thei that weren crucified with hym , dispiseden hym .
41015033	And whanne the sixte hour was come , derknessis weren made on al the erthe til in to the nynthe our .
41015034	And in the nynthe our Jhesus criede with a greet vois , and seide , Heloy , Heloy , lamasabatany , that is to seie , My God , my God , whi hast thou forsakun me ?
41015035	And summe of men that stoden aboute herden , and seiden , Lo ! he clepith Helye .
41015036	And oon ranne , and fillide a spounge with vynegre , and puttide aboute to a reede , and yaf to hym drynke , and seide , Suffre ye , se we , if Helie come to do hym doun .
41015037	And Jhesus yaf out a greet cry , and diede .
41015038	And the veil of the temple was rent atwo fro the hiyeste to bynethe .
41015039	But the centurien that stood forn ayens siy , that he so criynge hadde diede , and seide , Verili , this man was Goddis sone .
41015040	And ther weren also wymmen biholdynge fro afer , among whiche was Marie Maudeleyn , and Marie , the modir of James the lesse , and of Joseph , and of Salome .
41015041	And whanne Jhesus was in Galilee , thei folewiden hym , and mynystriden to hym , and many othere wymmen , that camen vp togidir with him to Jerusalem .
41015042	And whanne euentid was come , for it was the euentid which is bifor the sabat ,
41015043	Joseph of Armathie , the noble decurioun , cam , and he abood the rewme of God ; and booldli he entride to Pilat , and axide the bodi of Jhesu .
41015044	But Pilat wondride , if he were now deed .
41015045	And whanne the centurion was clepid , he axide hym , if he were deed ; and whanne he knewe of the centurion , he grauntide the bodi of Jhesu to Joseph .
41015046	And Joseph bouyte lynnen cloth , and took hym doun , and wlappide in the lynnen cloth , and leide hym in a sepulcre that was hewun of a stoon , and walewide a stoon to the dore of the sepulcre .
41015047	And Marie Maudeleyne and Marie of Joseph bihelden , where he was leid .
41016001	And whanne the sabat was passid , Marie Maudeleyne , and Marie of James , and Salomee bouyten swete smellynge oynementis , to come and to anoynte Jhesu .
41016002	And ful eerli in oon of the woke daies , thei camen to the sepulcre , whanne the sunne was risun .
41016003	And thei seiden togidere , Who schal meue awey to vs the stoon fro the dore of the sepulcre ?
41016004	And thei bihelden , and seien the stoon walewid awei , for it was ful greet .
41016005	And thei yeden in to the sepulcre , and sayn a yonglyng , hilide with a white stole , sittynge ` at the riythalf ; and thei weren afeerd .
41016006	Which seith to hem , Nyle ye drede ; ye seken Jhesu of Nazareth crucified ; he is risun , he is not here ; lo ! the place where thei leiden hym .
41016007	But go ye , and seie ye to hise disciplis , and to Petir , that he schal go bifor you in to Galilee ; there ye schulen se hym , as he seide to you .
41016008	And thei yeden out , and fledden fro the sepulcre ; for drede and quakyng had assailed hem , and to no man thei seiden ony thing , for thei dredden .
41016009	And Jhesus roos eerli the firste dai of the woke , and apperid firste to Marie Maudeleyne , fro whom he had caste out seuene deuelis .
41016010	And sche yede , and tolde to hem that hadden ben with hym , whiche weren weilynge and wepynge .
41016011	And thei herynge that he lyuyde , and was seyn of hir , bileueden not .
41016012	But after these thingis whanne tweyne of hem wandriden , he was schewid in anothir liknesse to hem goynge in to a toun .
41016013	And thei yeden , and telden to the othir , and nether thei bileueden to hem .

41016015	And he seide to hem , Go ye in to al the world , and preche the gospel to eche creature .
41016016	Who that bileueth , and is baptisid , schal be saaf ; but he that bileueth not , schal be dampned .
41016017	And these tokenes schulen sue hem , that bileuen . In my name thei schulen caste out feendis ; thei schulen speke with newe tungis ;
41016018	thei schulen do awei serpentis ; and if thei drynke ony venym , it schal not noye hem . Thei schulen sette her hondis on sijk men , and thei schulen wexe hoole .
41016019	And the Lord Jhesu , aftir he hadde spokun to hem , was takun vp in to heuene , and he sittith on the riythalf of God .
41016020	And thei yeden forth , and prechiden euery where , for the Lord wrouyte with hem , and confermyde the word with signes folewynge .
42001001	Forsothe for manye men enforceden to ordeyne the tellyng of thingis , whiche ben fillid in vs ,

42001004	thou best Theofile , that thou knowe the treuthe of tho wordis , of whiche thou art lerned .
42001005	In the daies of Eroude , kyng of Judee , ther was a prest , Sakarie bi name , of the sorte of Abia , and his wijf was of the douytris of Aaron , and hir name was Elizabeth .
42001006	And bothe weren iust bifor God , goynge in alle the maundementis and iustifiyngis of the Lord , withouten pleynt .
42001007	And thei hadden no child , for Elizabeth was bareyn , and bothe weren of grete age in her daies .
42001008	And it bifel , that whanne Zacarie schulde do the office of preesthod , in the ordre of his cours tofor God ,
42001009	aftir the custome of the preesthod , he wente forth bi lot , and entride in to the temple , to encense .
42001010	And al the multitude of the puple was with outforth , and preiede in the our of encensyng .
42001011	And an aungel of the Lord apperide to hym , and stood on the riythalf of the auter of encense .
42001012	And Zacarie seynge was afraied , and drede fel vpon hym .
42001013	And the aungel seide to hym , Zacarie , drede thou not ; for thi preyer is herd , and Elizabeth , thi wijf , schal bere to thee a sone , and his name schal be clepid Joon .
42001014	And ioye and gladyng schal be to thee ; and many schulen ` haue ioye in his natyuyte .
42001015	For he schal be greet bifor the Lord , and he schal not drynke wyn and sidir , and he schal be fulfillid with the Hooli Goost yit of his modir wombe .
42001016	And he schal conuerte many of the children of Israel to her Lord God ;

42001018	And Zacarie seide to the aungel , Wherof schal Y wite this ? for Y am eld , and my wijf hath gon fer in to hir daies .
42001019	And the aungel answeride , and seide to hym , For Y am Gabriel , that stonde niy bifor God ; and Y am sent to thee to speke , and to euangelize to thee these thingis .
42001020	And lo ! thou schalt be doumbe , and thou schalt not mow speke til in to the dai , in which these thingis schulen be don ; for thou hast not bileued to my wordis , whiche schulen be fulfillid in her tyme .
42001021	And the puple was abidynge Zacarie , and thei wondriden , that he tariede in the temple .
42001022	And he yede out , and myyte not speke to hem , and thei knewen that he hadde seyn a visioun in the temple . And he bikenyde to hem , and he dwellide stille doumbe .
42001023	And it was don , whanne the daies of his office weren fulfillid , he wente in to his hous .
42001024	And aftir these daies Elizabeth , his wijf , conseyuede , and hidde hir fyue monethis , and seide ,
42001025	For so the Lord dide to me in the daies , in whiche he bihelde , to take awei my repreef among men .
42001026	But in the sixte moneth the aungel Gabriel was sent fro God in to a citee of Galilee , whos name was Nazareth ,

42001028	And the aungel entride to hir , and seide , Heil , ful of grace ; the Lord be with thee ; blessid be thou among wymmen .
42001029	And whanne sche hadde herd , sche was troublid in his word , and thouyte what maner salutacioun this was .
42001030	And the aungel seide to hir , Ne drede thou not , Marie , for thou hast foundun grace anentis God .
42001031	Lo ! thou schalt conceyue in wombe , and schalt bere a sone , and thou schalt clepe his name Jhesus .
42001032	This schal be greet , and he schal be clepid the sone of the Hiyeste ; and the Lord God schal yeue to hym the seete of Dauid , his fadir , and he schal regne in the hous of Jacob with outen ende ,
42001033	and of his rewme schal be noon ende .
42001034	And Marie seide to the aungel , On what maner schal this thing be doon , for Y knowe not man ?
42001035	And the aungel answeride , and seide to hir , The Hooly Goost schal come fro aboue in to thee , and the vertu of the Hiyeste schal ouerschadewe thee ; and therfor that hooli thing that schal be borun of thee , schal be clepid the sone of God .

42001039	And Marie roos vp in tho daies , and wente with haaste in to the mounteyns , in to a citee of Judee .
42001040	And sche entride in to the hous of Zacarie , and grette Elizabeth .
42001041	And it was don , as Elizabeth herde the salutacioun of Marie , the yong child in hir wombe gladide . And Elizabeth was fulfillid with the Hooli Goost ,
42001042	and criede with a greet vois , and seide , Blessid be thou among wymmen , and blessid be the fruyt of thi wombe .
42001043	And whereof is this thing to me , that the modir of my Lord come to me ?
42001044	For lo ! as the voice of thi salutacioun was maad in myn eeris , the yong child gladide in ioye in my wombe .
42001045	And blessid be thou , that hast bileued , for thilke thingis that ben seid of the Lord to thee , schulen be parfitli don .
42001046	And Marie seide , Mi soule magnyfieth the Lord ,

42003015	Whanne al the puple gesside , and alle men thouyten in her hertis of Joon , lest perauenture he were Crist ,
42003016	Joon answeride , and seide to alle men , Y baptize you in watir ; but a stronger than Y schal come aftir me , of whom Y am not worthi to vnbynde the lace of his schoon ; he schal baptize you in the Hooli Goost and fier .
42003017	Whos ` wynewyng tool in his hond , and he schal purge his floor of corn , and schal gadere the whete in to his berne ; but the chaffis he schal brenne with fier vnquenchable .
42003018	And many othere thingis also he spak , and prechide to the puple . But Eroude tetrark , whanne he was blamed of Joon for Erodias ,

42003020	encreside this ouer alle , and schitte Joon in prisoun .
42003021	And it was don , whanne al the puple was baptised , and whanne Jhesu was baptised , and preiede , heuene was openyd .
42003022	And the Hooli Goost cam doun in bodili licnesse , as a dowue on hym ; and a vois was maad fro heuene , Thou art my derworth sone , in thee it hath plesid to me .
42003023	And Jhesu hym silf was bigynninge as of thritti yeer , that he was gessid the sone of Joseph , which was of Heli ,

42004001	And Jhesus ful of the Hooli Goost turnede ayen fro Jordan , and was led bi the spirit into desert fourti daies ,
42004002	and was temptid of the deuel , and eet nothing in tho daies ; and whanne tho daies weren endid , he hungride .
42004003	And the deuel seide to him , If thou art Goddis sone , seie to this stoon , that it be maad breed .
42004004	And Jhesus answeride to hym , It is writun , That a man lyueth not in breed aloone , but in euery word of God .
42004005	And the deuel ladde hym in to an hiy hil , and schewide to hym alle the rewmes of the world in a moment of tyme ;

42004014	And Jhesus turnede ayen in the vertu of the spirit in to Galilee , and the fame wente forth of hym thorou al the cuntre .
42004015	And he tauyte in the synagogis of hem , and was magnyfied of alle men .
42004016	And he cam to Nazareth , where he was norisschid , and entride aftir his custom in the sabat dai in to a synagoge , and roos to reed .
42004017	And the book of Ysaye , the prophete , was takun to hym ; and as he turnede the book , he foond a place , where it was wrytun ,
42004018	The Spirit of the Lord on me , for which thing he anoyntide me ; he sente me to preche to pore men , to hele contrite men in herte ,
42004019	and to preche remyssioun to prisoneris , and siyt to blynde men , and to delyuere brokun men in to remissioun ; to preche the yeer of the Lord plesaunt , and the dai of yeldyng ayen .
42004020	And whanne he hadde closid the book , he yaf ayen to the mynystre , and sat ; and the iyen of alle men in the synagoge were biholdynge in to hym .

42004024	And he seide , Treuli Y seie to you , that no profete is resseyued in his owne cuntre .
42004025	In treuthe Y seie to you , that many widowis weren in the daies of Elie , the prophete , in Israel , whanne heuene was closid thre yeer and sixe monethis , whanne greet hungur was maad in al the erthe ;

42004032	And thei weren astonyed in his techyng , for his word was in power .
42004033	And in her synagoge was a man hauynge an vnclene feend , and he criede with greet vois ,
42004034	and seide , Suffre , what to vs and to thee , Jhesu of Nazareth ? art thou comun to leese vs ? Y knowe , that thou art the hooli of God .
42004035	And Jhesus blamede hym , and seide , Wexe doumbe , and go out fro hym . And whanne the feend hadde cast hym forth in to the myddil , he wente a wei fro hym , and he noyede hym no thing .
42004036	And drede was maad in alle men , and thei spaken togider , and seiden , What is this word , for in power and vertu he comaundith to vnclene spiritis , and thei gon out ?
42004037	And the fame was pupplischid of him in to ech place of the cuntre .
42004038	And Jhesus roos vp fro the synagoge , and entride in to the hous of Symount ; and the modir of Symountis wijf was holdun with grete fyueris , and thei preieden hym for hir .
42004039	And Jhesus stood ouer hir , and comaundide to the feuer , and it lefte hir ; and anoon sche roos vp , and seruede hem .
42004040	And whanne the sunne wente doun , alle that hadden sijke men with dyuerse langours , ledden hem to hym ; and he sette his hoondis on ech bi ` hem silf , and heelide hem .
42004041	And feendis wenten out fro manye , and crieden , and seiden , For thou art the sone of God . And he blamede , and suffride hem not to speke , for thei wisten hym , that he was Crist .
42004042	And whanne the dai was come , he yede out , and wente in to a desert place ; and the puple souyten hym , and thei camen to hym , and thei helden hym , that he schulde not go a wei fro hem .
42004043	To whiche he seide , For also to othere citees it bihoueth me to preche the kyngdom of God , for therfor Y am sent .
42004044	And he prechide in the synagogis of Galilee .
42005001	And it was don , whanne the puple cam fast to Jhesu , to here the word of God , he stood bisidis the pool of Genasereth ,
42005002	and saiy two bootis stondynge bisidis the pool ; and the fischeris weren go doun , and waischiden her nettis .
42005003	And he wente vp in to a boot , that was Symoundis , and preiede hym to lede it a litil fro the loond ; and he seet , and tauyte the puple out of the boot .
42005004	And as he ceesside to speke , he seide to Symount , Lede thou in to the depthe , and slake youre nettis to take fisch .
42005005	And Symount answeride , and seide to hym , Comaundoure , we traueliden al the nyyt , and token no thing , but in thi word Y schal leye out the net .
42005006	And whanne thei hadden do this thing , thei closiden togidir a greet multitude of fischis ; and her net was brokun .
42005007	And thei bikenyden to felawis , that weren in anothir boot , that thei schulden come , and helpe hem . And thei camen , and filliden bothe the bootis , so that thei weren almost drenchid .
42005008	And whanne Symount Petir saiy this thing , he felde doun to the knees of Jhesu , and seide , Lord , go fro me , for Y am a synful man .
42005009	For he was on ech side astonyed , and alle that weren with hym , in the takyng of fischis whiche thei token .
42005010	Sotheli in lijk maner James and Joon , the sones of Zebedee , that weren felowis of Symount Petre . And Jhesus seide to Symount , Nyle thou drede ; now fro this tyme thou schalt take men .
42005011	And whanne the bootis weren led vp to the loond , thei leften alle thingis , and thei sueden hym .
42005012	And it was don , whanne he was in oon of the citees , lo ! a man ful of lepre ; and seynge Jhesu felle doun on his face , and preyede hym , and seide , Lord , if thou wolt , thou maist make me clene .
42005013	And Jhesus held forth his hoond , and touchide hym , and seide , Y wole , be thou maad cleene . And anoon the lepre passide awei fro hym .
42005014	And Jhesus comaundide to hym , that he schulde seie to no man ; But go , schewe thou thee to a preest , and offre for thi clensyng , as Moises bad , in to witnessyng to hem .
42005015	And the word walkide aboute the more of hym ; and myche puple camen togidere , to here , and to be heelid of her siknessis .
42005016	And he wente in to desert , and preiede .
42005017	And it was don in oon of the daies , he sat , and tauyte ; and there weren Farisees sittynge , and doctouris of the lawe , that camen of eche castel of Galilee , and of Judee , and of Jerusalem ; and the vertu of the Lord was to heele sike men .
42005018	And lo ! men beren in a bed a man that was sijk in the palsye , and thei souyten to bere hym in , and sette bifor hym .
42005019	And thei founden not in what partie thei schulden bere hym in , for the puple , ` and thei wenten on the roof , and bi the sclattis thei leeten hym doun with the bed , in to the myddil , bifor Jhesus .
42005020	And whanne Jhesu saiy the feith of hem , he seide , Man , thi synnes ben foryouun to thee .
42005021	And the scribis and Farisees bigunnen to thenke , seiynge , Who is this , that spekith blasfemyes ? who may foryyue synnes , but God aloone ?
42005022	And as Jhesus knewe the thouytis of hem , he answeride , and seide to hem , What thenken ye yuele thingis in youre hertes ?
42005023	What is liyter to seie , Synnes ben foryouun to thee , or to seie , Rise vp , and walke ?
42005024	But that ye wite , that mannus sone hath power in erthe to foryyue synnes , he seide to the sijk man in palesie , Y seie to thee , ryse vp , take thi bed , and go in to thin hous .
42005025	And anoon he roos vp bifor hem , and took the bed in which he lay , and wente in to his hous , and magnyfiede God .
42005026	And greet wondur took alle , and thei magnyfieden God ; and thei weren fulfillid with greet drede , and seiden , For we han seyn merueilouse thingis to dai .
42005027	And after these thingis Jhesus wente out , and saiy a pupplican , Leuy bi name , sittynge at the tolbothe . And he seide to hym , Sue thou me ;
42005028	and whanne he hadde left alle thingis , he roos vp , and suede hym .
42005029	And Leuy made to hym a greet feeste in his hous ; and ther was a greet cumpanye of pupplicans , and of othere that weren with hem , sittynge at the mete .
42005030	And Farisees and the scribis of hem grutchiden , and seiden to hise disciplis , Whi eten ye and drynken with pupplicans and synful men ?
42005031	And Jhesus answeride , and seide to hem , Thei that ben hoole han no nede to a leche , but thei that ben sijke ;
42005032	for Y cam not to clepe iuste men , but synful men to penaunce .
42005033	And thei seiden to hym , Whi the disciplis of Joon fasten ofte , and maken preieris , also and of Farisees , but thine eten and drynken ?
42005034	To whiche he seide , Whether ye moun make the sones of the spouse to faste , while the spouse is with hem ?
42005035	But daies schulen come , whanne the spouse schal be takun a wei fro hem , and thanne thei schulen faste in tho daies .
42005036	And he seide to hem also a liknesse ; For no man takith a pece fro a newe cloth , and puttith it in to an oold clothing ; ellis bothe he brekith the newe , and the pece of the newe acordith not to the elde .
42005037	And no man puttith newe wyne in to oolde botels ; ellis the newe wyn schal breke the botels , and the wyn schal be sched out , and the botels schulen perische .
42005038	But newe wyne owith to be put in to newe botels , and bothe ben kept .
42005039	And no man drynkynge the elde , wole anoon the newe ; for he seith , The olde is the betere .
42006001	And it was don in the secounde firste sabat , whanne he passid bi cornes , hise disciplis pluckiden eeris of corn ; and thei frotynge with her hondis , eeten .
42006002	And summe of the Farisees seiden to hem , What doon ye that , that is not leeueful in the sabotis ?
42006003	And Jhesus answeride , and seide to hem , Han ye not redde , what Dauith dide , whanne he hungride , and thei that weren with hym ;
42006004	hou he entride in to the hous of God , and took looues of proposicioun , and eet , and yaf to hem that weren with hem ; whiche looues it was not leeueful to eete , but oonli to prestis .
42006005	And he seide to hem , For mannus sone is lord , yhe , of the sabat .
42006006	And it was don in another sabat , that he entride in to a synagoge , and tauyte . And a man was there , and his riyt hoond was drie .
42006007	And the scribis and Farisees aspieden hym , if he wolde heele hym in the sabat , that thei schulden fynde cause , whereof thei schulden accuse hym .
42006008	And he wiste the thouytis of hem , and he seide to the man that hadde a drie hoond , Rise vp , and stonde in to the myddil . And he roos , and stood .
42006009	And Jhesus seide to hem , Y axe you , if it is leueful to do wel in the sabat , or yuel ? to make a soule saaf , or to leese ?
42006010	And whanne he hadde biholde alle men aboute , he seide to the man , Hold forth thin hoond . And he held forth , and his hond was restorid to helthe .
42006011	And thei weren fulfillid with vnwisdom , and spaken togidir , what thei schulden do of Jhesu .
42006012	And it was don in tho daies , he wente out in to an hil to preye ; and he was al nyyt dwellynge in the preier of God .
42006013	And whanne the day was come , he clepide hise disciplis , and chees twelue of hem , whiche he clepide also apostlis ;
42006014	Symount , whom he clepide Petir , and Andrew , his brothir , James and Joon ,
42006015	Filip and Bartholomew , Matheu and Thomas , James Alphei , and Symount , that is clepid Zelotes ,
42006016	Judas of James , and Judas Scarioth , that was traytoure .
42006017	And Jhesus cam doun fro the hil with hem , and stood in a feeldi place ; and the cumpeny of hise disciplis , and a greet multitude of puple , of al Judee , and Jerusalem , and of the see coostis , and of Tyre and Sidon ,
42006018	that camen to here hym , and to be heelid of her siknessis ; and thei that weren trauelid of vncleene spiritis , weren heelid .
42006019	And al puple souyte to touche hym , for vertu wente out of hym , and heelide alle .
42006020	And whanne hise iyen weren cast vp in to hise disciplis , he seide , Blessid be ye , ` pore men , for the kyngdom of God is youre .
42006021	Blessid be ye , that now hungren , for ye schulen be fulfillid . Blessid be ye , that now wepen , for ye schulen leiye .
42006022	Ye schulen be blessid , whanne men schulen hate you , and departe you awei , and putte schenschip to you , and cast out youre name as yuel , for mannus sone .
42006023	Joye ye in that dai , and be ye glad ; for lo ! youre meede is myche in heuene ; for aftir these thingis the fadris of hem diden to prophetis .
42006024	Netheles wo to you , riche men , that han youre coumfort .
42006025	Wo to you that ben fulfillid , for ye schulen hungre . Wo to you that now leiyen , for ye schulen morne , and wepe .
42006026	Wo to you , whanne alle men schulen blesse you ; aftir these thingis the fadris of hem diden to profetis .
42006027	But Y seie to you that heren , loue ye youre enemyes , do ye wel to hem that hatiden you ;
42006028	blesse ye men that cursen you , preye ye for men that defamen you .
42006029	And to him that smytith thee on o cheeke , schewe also the tothir ; and fro hym that takith awei fro thee a cloth , nyle thou forbede the coote .
42006030	And yyue to eche that axith thee , and if a man takith awei tho thingis that ben thine , axe thou not ayen .
42006031	And as ye wolen that men do to you , do ye also to hem in lijk maner .
42006032	And if ye louen hem that louen you , what thanke is to you ? for synful men louen men that louen hem .
42006033	And if ye don wel to hem that don wel to you , what grace is to you ? synful men don this thing .
42006034	And if ye leenen to hem of whiche ye hopen to take ayen , what thanke is to you ? for synful men leenen to synful men , to take ayen as myche .
42006035	Netheles loue ye youre enemyes , and do ye wel , and leene ye , hopinge no thing therof , and youre mede schal be myche , and ye schulen be the sones of the Heyest , for he is benygne on vnkynde men and yuele men .
42006036	Therfor be ye merciful , as youre fadir is merciful .
42006037	Nyle ye deme , and ye schulen not be demed . Nyle ye condempne , and ye schulen not be condempned ; foryyue ye , and it schal be foryouun to you .
42006038	Yyue ye , and it schal be youun to you . Thei schulen yyue in to youre bosum a good mesure , and wel fillid , and schakun togidir , and ouerflowynge ; for bi the same mesure , bi whiche ye meeten , it schal be metun ` ayen to you .
42006039	And he seide to hem a liknesse , Whether the blynde may leede the blynde ? ne fallen thei not bothe ` in to the diche ?
42006040	A disciple is not aboue the maistir ; but eche schal be perfite , if he be as his maister .
42006041	And what seest thou in thi brotheris iye a moot , but thou biholdist not a beem , that is in thin owne iye ?
42006042	Or hou maist thou seie to thi brother , Brothir , suffre , Y schal caste out the moot of thin iye , and thou biholdist not a beem in thin owne iye ? Ipocrite , first take out the beem of thin iye , and thanne thou schalt se to take the moot of thi brotheris iye .
42006043	It is not a good tree , that makith yuel fruytis , nether an yuel tree , that makith good fruytis ;
42006044	for euery tre is knowun of his fruyt . And men gaderen not figus of thornes , nethir men gaderen a grape of a buysche of breris .
42006045	A good man of the good tresoure of his herte bryngith forth good thingis , and an yuel man of the yuel tresoure bryngith forth yuel thingis ; for of the plente of the herte the mouth spekith .
42006046	And what clepen ye me , Lord , Lord , and doon not tho thingis that Y seie .
42006047	Eche that cometh to me , and herith my wordis , and doith hem , Y schal schewe to you , to whom he is lijk .
42006048	He is lijk to a man that bildith an hous , that diggide deepe , and sette the foundement on a stoon . And whanne greet flood was maad , the flood was hurtlid to that hous , and it miyte not moue it , for it was foundid on a sad stoon .
42006049	But he that herith , and doith not , is lijk to a man bildynge his hous on erthe with outen foundement ; in to which the flood was hurlid , and anoon it felle doun ; and the fallyng doun of that hous was maad greet .
42007001	And whanne he hadde fulfillid alle hise wordis in to the eeris of the puple , he entride in to Cafarnaum .
42007002	But a seruaunt of a centurien , that was precious to hym , was sijk , and drawynge to the deeth .
42007003	And whanne he hadde herd of Jhesu , he sente to hym the eldere men of Jewis , and preiede hym , that he wolde come , and heele his seruaunt .
42007004	And whanne thei camen to Jhesu , thei preieden hym bisili , and seiden to hym , For he is worthi , that thou graunte to hym this thing ;
42007005	for he loueth oure folk , and he bildide to vs a synagoge .
42007006	And Jhesus wente with hem . And whanne he was not fer fro the hous , the centurien sente to hym freendis , and seide , Lord , nyle thou be trauelid , for Y am not worthi , that thou entre vnder my roof ;
42007007	for which thing and Y demede not my silf worthi , that Y come to thee ; but seie thou bi word , and my child schal be helid .
42007008	For Y am a man ordeyned vndur power , and haue knyytis vndur me ; and Y seie to this , Go , and he goith , and to anothir , Come , and he cometh , and to my seruaunt , Do this thing , and he doith .
42007009	And whanne this thing was herd , Jhesus wondride ; and seide to the puple suynge hym , Treuli Y seie to you , nether in Israel Y foond so greet feith .
42007010	And thei that weren sent , turneden ayen home , and founden the seruaunt hool , which was sijk .
42007011	And it was don aftirward , Jhesus wente in to a citee , that is clepid Naym , and hise disciplis ; and ful greet puple wente with hym .
42007012	And whanne he cam nyy to the yate of the citee , lo ! the sone of a womman that hadde no mo children , was borun out deed ; and this was a widowe ; and myche puple of the citee with hir .
42007013	And whanne the Lord Jhesu hadde seyn hir , he hadde reuthe on hir , and seide to hir , Nyle thou wepe .
42007014	And he cam nyy , and touchide the beere ; and thei that baren stoden . And he seide , Yonge man , Y seie to thee , rise vp .
42007015	And he that was deed sat vp ayen , and bigan to speke ; and he yaf hym to his modir .
42007016	And drede took alle men , and thei magnyfieden God , and seiden , For a grete profete is rysun among vs , and , For God hath visitid his puple .
42007017	And this word wente out of hym in to al Judee , and in to al the cuntre aboute .
42007018	And Joones disciplis toolden hym of alle these thingis .
42007019	And Joon clepide tweyn of hise disciplis , and sente hem to Jhesu , and seide , Art thou he that is to come , or abiden we anothir ?
42007020	And whanne the men cam to hym , thei seiden , Joon Baptist sente vs to thee , and seide , Art thou he that is to come , or we abiden anothir ?
42007021	And in that our he heelide many men of her sijknessis , and woundis , and yuel spiritis ; and he yaf siyt to many blynde men .
42007022	And Jhesus answerde , and seide to hem , Go ye ayen , and telle ye to Joon tho thingis that ye han herd and seyn ; blynde men seyn , crokid men goen , mesels ben maad cleene , deef men heren , deed men risen ayen , pore men ben takun to prechyng of the gospel .
42007023	And he that schal not be sclaundrid in me , is blessid .
42007024	And whanne the messangeris of Joon weren go forth , he bigan to seie of Joon to the puple ,
42007025	What wenten ye out in to desert to se ? a reed waggid with the wynd ?
42007026	But what wenten ye out to se ? a man clothid with softe clothis ? Lo ! thei that ben in precious cloth and in delicis , ben in kyngis housis . But what wenten ye out to se ? a profete ? Yhe , Y seie to you , and more than a profete .
42007027	This is he , of whom it is writun , Lo ! Y sende myn aungel bifor thi face , which schal make ` thi weie redi bifor thee .
42007028	Certis Y seie to you , there is no man more prophete among children of wymmen , than is Joon ; but he that is lesse in the kyngdom of heuenes , is more than he .
42007029	And al the puple herynge , and pupplicans , that hadden be baptisid with baptym of Joon , iustifieden God ;
42007030	but the Farisees and the wise men of the lawe , that weren not baptisid of hym , dispisiden the counsel of God ayens hem silf .
42007031	And the Lord seide , Therfor to whom schal Y seie ` men of this generacioun lijk , and to whom ben thei lijk ?
42007032	Thei ben lijk to children sittynge in chepyng , and spekynge togider , and seiynge , We han sungun to you with pipis , and ye han not daunsid ; we han maad mornyng , and ye han not wept .
42007033	For Joon Baptist cam , nethir etynge breed , ne drynkynge wyne , and ye seyen , He hath a feend .
42007034	Mannus sone cam etynge and drynkynge , and ye seien , Lo ! a man a deuourer , and drynkynge wyne , a frend of pupplicans and of synful men .
42007035	And wisdom is iustified of her sones .
42007036	But oon of the Farisees preiede Jhesu , that he schulde ete with hym . And he entride in to the hous of the Farise , and sat at the mete .
42007037	And lo ! a synful womman , that was in the citee , as sche knewe , that Jhesu sat at the mete in the hous of the Farisee , sche brouyte an alabaustre box of oynement ;
42007038	and sche stood bihynde bysidis hise feet , and bigan to moiste hise feet with teeris , and wipide with the heeris of hir heed , and kiste hise feet , and anoyntide with oynement .
42007039	And the Farise seynge , that hadde clepide hym , seide within hym silf , seiynge , If this were a prophete , he schulde wite , who and what maner womman it were that touchith hym , for sche is a synful womman .
42007040	And Jhesus answeride , and seide to hym , Symount , Y haue sumthing to seie to thee . And he seide , Maistir , seie thou .
42007041	And he answeride , Twei dettouris weren to o lener ; and oon auyt fyue hundrid pans , and ` the other fifti ;
42007042	but whanne thei hadden not wherof ` thei schulden yeelde , he foryaf to bothe . Who thanne loueth hym more ?
42007043	Symount answeride , and seide , Y gesse , that he to whom he foryaf more . And he answeride to hym , Thou hast demyd riytli .
42007044	And he turnede to the womman , and seide to Symount , Seest thou this womman ? I entride into thin hous , thou yaf no watir to my feet ; but this hath moistid my feet with teeris , and wipide with hir heeris .
42007045	Thou hast not youun to me a cosse ; but this , sithen sche entride , ceesside not to kisse my feet .
42007046	Thou anoyntidist not myn heed with oile ; but this anoyntide my feet with oynement .
42007047	For the which thing Y seie to thee , many synnes ben foryouun to hir , for sche hath loued myche ; and to whom is lesse foryouun , he loueth lesse .
42007048	And Jhesus seide to hir , Thi synnes ben foryouun to thee .
42007049	And thei that saten to gider at the mete , bigunnen to seie with ynne hem silf , Who is this that foryyueth synnes .
42007050	But he seide to the womman , Thi feith hath maad thee saaf ; go thou in pees .
42008001	And it was don aftirward , and Jhesus made iourney bi citees and castels , prechynge and euangelisynge the rewme of God , and twelue with hym ;
42008002	and sum wymmen that weren heelid of wickid spiritis and sijknessis , Marie , that is clepid Maudeleyn , of whom seuene deuelis wenten out ,
42008003	and Joone , the wijf of Chuse , the procuratoure of Eroude , and Susanne , and many othir , that mynystriden to hym of her ritchesse .
42008004	And whanne myche puple was come togidir , and men hiyeden to hym fro the citees , he seide bi a symylitude ,
42008005	He that sowith , yede out to sowe his seed . And while he sowith , sum fel bisidis the weie , and was defoulid , and briddis of the eir eten it .
42008006	And othir fel on a stoon , and it sprunge vp , and driede , for it hadde not moysture .
42008007	And othir fel among thornes , and the thornes sprongen vp togider , and strangliden it .
42008008	And othir fel in to good erthe , and it sprungun made an hundrid foold fruyt . He seide these thingis , and criede , He that hath eeris of heryng , here he .
42008009	But hise disciplis axiden him , what this parable was .
42008010	And he seide to hem , To you it is grauntid to knowe the pryuete of the kyngdom of God ; but to othir men in parablis , that thei seynge se not , and thei herynge vndurstonde not .
42008011	And this is the parable .
42008012	The seed is Goddis word ; and thei that ben bisidis the weie , ben these that heren ; and aftirward the feend cometh , and takith awei the word fro her herte , lest thei bileuynge be maad saaf .
42008013	But thei that fel on a stoon , ben these that whanne thei han herd , resseyuen the word with ioye . And these han not rootis ; for at a tyme thei bileuen , and in tyme of temptacioun thei goen awei .
42008014	But that that fel among thornes , ben these that herden , and of bisynessis , and ritchessis , and lustis of lijf thei gon forth , and ben stranglid , and bryngen forth no fruyt .
42008015	But that that fel in to good erthe , ben these that , in a good herte , and best heren the word , and holdun , and brengen forth fruyt in pacience .
42008016	No man lityneth a lanterne , and hilith it with a vessel , or puttith it vndur a bed , but on a candilstike , that men that entren seen liyt .
42008017	For ther is no priuei thing , which schal not be openyd , nether hid thing , which schal not be knowun , and come in to open .
42008018	Therfor se ye , hou ye heren ; for it schal be youun to hym that hath , and who euer hath not , also that that he weneth that he haue , schal be takun awei fro hym .
42008019	And his modir and britheren camen to hym ; and thei myyten not come to hym for the puple .
42008020	And it was teeld to hym , Thi modir and thi britheren stonden with outforth , willynge to se thee .
42008021	And he answeride , and seide to hem , My modir and my britheren ben these , that heren the word of God , and doon it .
42008022	And it was don in oon of daies , he wente vp in to a boot , and hise disciplis . And he seide to hem , Passe we ouer the see . And thei wenten vp .
42008023	And while thei rowiden , he slepte . And a tempest of wynde cam doun in to the watir , and thei weren dryuun hidur and thidur with wawis , and weren in perel .
42008024	And thei camen nyy , and reisiden hym , and seiden , Comaundoure , we perischen . And he roos , and blamyde the wynde , and the tempest of the watir ; and it ceesside , and pesibilte was maad .
42008025	And he seide to hem , Where is youre feith ? Which dredynge wondriden , and seiden togidir , Who , gessist thou , is this ? for he comaundith to wyndis and to the see , and thei obeien to hym .
42008026	And thei rowiden to the cuntree of Gerasenus , that is ayens Galilee .
42008027	And whanne he wente out to the loond , a man ran to hym , that hadde a deuel long tyme , and he was not clothid with cloth , nether dwellide in hous , but in sepulcris .
42008028	This , whanne he saiy Jhesu , fel doun bifor hym , and he criynge with a greet vois seide , What to me and to thee , Jhesu , the sone of the hiyest God ? Y biseche thee , that thou turmente ` not me .
42008029	For he comaundide the vncleene spirit , that he schulde go out fro the man . For he took hym ofte tymes , and he was boundun with cheynes , and kept in stockis , and , whanne the boondis weren brokun , he was lad of deuelis in to desert .
42008030	And Jhesus axide hym , and seide , What name is to thee ? And he seide , A legioun ; for many deuelis weren entrid in to hym .
42008031	And thei preyden hym , that he schulde not comaunde hem , that thei schulden go in to helle .
42008032	And there was a flok of many swyne lesewynge in an hil , and thei preieden hym , that he schulde suffre hem to entre in to hem . And he suffride hem .
42008033	And so the deuelis wenten out fro the man , and entriden in to the swyne ; and with a birre the flok wente heedlyng in to the pool , and was drenchid .
42008034	And whanne the hirdis sayn this thing don , thei flowen , and tolden in to the cite , and in to the townes .
42008035	And thei yeden out to se that thing that was don . And thei camen to Jhesu , and thei founden the man sittynge clothid , fro whom the deuelis wenten out , and in hool mynde at hise feet ; and thei dredden .
42008036	And thei that sayn tolden to hem , hou he was maad hool of the legioun .
42008037	And al the multitude of the cuntre of Gerasenus preiede hym , that he schulde go fro hem , for thei werun holdun with greet drede . He wente vp in to a boot , and turnede ayen .
42008038	And the man of whom the deuelis weren gon out , preide hym , that he schulde be with hym . Jhesus lefte hym ,
42008039	and seide , Go ayen in to thin hous , and telle hou grete thingis God hath don to thee . And he wente thorow al the cite , and prechide , hou grete thingis Jhesus hadde don to hym .
42008040	And it was don , whanne Jhesus was gon ayen , the puple resseyuede hym ; for alle weren abidynge hym .
42008041	And lo ! a man , to whom the name was Jayrus , and he was prynce of a synagoge ; and he fel doun at the feet of Jhesu , and preiede hym , that he schulde entre in to his hous ,
42008042	for he hadde but o douyter ` almost of twelue yeer eelde , and sche was deed . And it bifel , the while he wente , he was thrungun of the puple .
42008043	And a womman that hadde a flux of blood twelue yeer , and hadde spendid al hir catel in leechis , and sche miyte not be curid of ony ,
42008044	and sche cam nyy bihynde , and touchide the hem of his cloth , and anoon the fluxe of hir blood ceesside .
42008045	And Jhesus seide , Who is that touchide me ? And whanne alle men denyeden , Petre seide , and thei that weren with hym , Comaundour , the puple thristen , and disesen thee , and thou seist , Who touchide me ?
42008046	And Jhesus seide , Summan hath touchid me , for that vertu yede out of me .
42008047	And the womman seynge , that it was not hid fro hym , cam tremblynge , and fel doun at hise feet , and for what cause sche hadde touchid hym sche schewide bifor al the puple , and hou anoon sche was helid .
42008048	And he seide to hir , Douytir , thi feith hath maad thee saaf ; go thou in pees .
42008049	And yit while he spak , a man cam fro the prince of the synagoge , and seide to hym , Thi douytir is deed , nyle thou trauel the maister .
42008050	And whanne this word was herd , Jhesus answeride to the fadir of the damysel , Nyle thou drede , but bileue thou oonli , and sche schal be saaf .
42008051	And whanne he cam to the hous , he suffride no man to entre with hym , but Petir and Joon and James , and the fadir and the modir of the damysel .
42008052	And alle wepten , and biweileden hir . And he seide , Nyle ye wepe , for the damysel is not deed , but slepith .
42008053	And thei scorneden hym , and wisten that sche was deed .
42008054	But he helde hir hoond , and criede , and seide , Damysel , rise vp .
42008055	And hir spirit turnede ayen , and sche roos anoon . And he comaundide to yyue to hir to ete .
42008056	And hir fadir and modir wondriden greetli ; and he comaundide hem , that thei schulden not seie to ony that thing that was don .
42009001	And whanne the twelue apostlis weren clepid togidir , Jhesus yaf to hem vertu and power on alle deuelis , and that thei schulden heele sijknessis .
42009002	And he sente hem for to preche the kyngdom of God , and to heele sijk men .
42009003	And he seide to hem , No thing take ye in the weie , nether yerde , ne scrippe , nether breed , ne money , and nether haue ye two cootis .
42009004	And in to what hous that ye entren , dwelle ye there , and go ye not out fro thennus .
42009005	And who euer resseyuen not you , go ye out of that citee , and schake ye of the poudir of youre feet in to witnessyng on hem .
42009006	And thei yeden forth , and wenten aboute bi castels , prechynge and helynge euery where .
42009007	And Eroude tetrak herde alle thingis that weren don of hym , and he doutide ,
42009008	for that it was seide of sum men , that Joon was risen fro deth ; and of summen , that Elie hadde apperid ; but of othere , that oon of the elde prophetis was risun .
42009009	And Eroude seide , Y haue biheedid Joon ; and who is this , of whom Y here siche thingis ? And he souyte to se hym .
42009010	And the apostlis turneden ayen , and tolden to hym alle thingis that thei hadden don . And he took hem , and wente bisidis in to a desert place , that is Bethsada .
42009011	And whanne the puple knewen this , thei folewiden hym . And he resseyuede hem , and spak to hem of the kyngdom of God ; and he heelide hem that hadden neede of cure .
42009012	And the dai bigan to bowe doun , and the twelue camen , and seiden to hym , Leeue the puple , that thei go , and turne in to castels and townes , that ben aboute , that thei fynde mete , for we ben here in a desert place .
42009013	And he seide to hem , Yue ye to hem to ete . And thei seiden , Ther ben not to vs mo than fyue looues and twei fischis , but perauenture that we go , and bie meetis to al this puple .
42009014	And the men weren almost fyue thousynde . And he seide to hise disciplis , Make ye hem sitte to mete bi cumpanyes , a fifti to gidir .
42009015	And thei diden so , and thei maden alle men sitte to mete .
42009016	And whanne he hadde take the fyue looues and twei fischis , he biheeld in to heuene , and blesside hem , and brak , and delide to hise disciplis , that thei schulden sette forth bifor the cumpanyes .
42009017	And alle men eeten , and weren fulfillid ; and that that lefte to hem of brokun metis was takun vp , twelue cofyns .
42009018	And it was don , whanne he was aloone preiynge , hise disciplis weren with hym , and he axide hem , and seide , Whom seien the puple that Y am ?
42009019	And thei answeriden , and seiden , Joon Baptist , othir seien Elie , and othir seien , o profete of the formere is risun .
42009020	And he seide to hem , But who seien ye that Y am ? Symount Petir answeride , and seide , The Crist of God .
42009021	And he blamynge hem comaundide that thei schulden seie to no man ,
42009022	and seide these thingis , For it bihoueth mannus sone to suffre many thingis , and to be repreued of the elder men , and of the princis of prestis , and of scribis , and to be slayn , and the thridde dai to rise ayen .
42009023	And he seide to alle , If ony wole come aftir me , denye he hym silf , and take he his cross euery dai , and sue he me .
42009024	For he that wole make his lijf saaf schal leese it ; and he that leesith his lijf for me , schal make it saaf .
42009025	And what profitith it to a man , if he wynne al the world , and leese hymsilf , and do peiryng of him silf .
42009026	For who so schameth me and my wordis , mannus sone schal schame hym , whanne he cometh in his maieste , and of the fadris , and of the hooli aungels .
42009027	And Y seie to you , verily ther ben summe stondynge here , whiche schulen not taste deeth , til thei seen the rewme of God .
42009028	And it was don aftir these wordis almest eiyte daies , and he took Petre and James and Joon , and he stiede in to an hil , to preye .
42009029	And while he preiede , the licnesse of his cheer was chaungid , and his clothing was whit schynynge .
42009030	And lo ! two men spaken with hym ,
42009031	and Moises and Helie weren seen in maieste ; and thei sayn his goyng out , which he schulde fulfille in Jerusalem .
42009032	And Petre , and thei that weren with hym , weren heuy of sleep , and thei wakynge saien his majeste , and the twey men that stoden with hym .
42009033	And it was don , whanne thei departiden fro hym , Petir seide to Jhesu , Comaundour , it is good that we be here , and make we here thre tabernaclis , oon to thee , and oon to Moises , and oon to Elie . And he wiste not what he schulde seie .
42009034	But while he spak these thingis , a cloude was maad , and ouerschadewide hem ; and thei dredden , whanne thei entriden in to the cloude .
42009035	And a vois was maad out of the cloude , and seide , This is my derworth sone , here ye hym .
42009036	And while the vois was maad , Jhesu was foundun aloone . And thei weren stille , and to no man seiden in tho daies ouyt of tho thingis , that thei hadden seyn .
42009037	But it was doon in the dai suynge , whanne thei camen doun of the hil , myche puple mette hem .
42009038	And lo ! a man of the cumpany criede , and seide , Maister , Y biseche thee , biholde my sone , for Y haue no mo ; and lo !
42009039	a spirit takith hym , and sudenli he crieth , and hurtlith doun , and to-drawith hym with fome , and vnneth he goith awei al to-drawynge hym .
42009040	And Y preiede thi disciplis , that thei schulden caste hym out , and thei myyten not .
42009041	And Jhesus answerde and seide to hem , A ! vnfeithful generacioun and weiward , hou long schal Y be at you , and suffre you ? brynge hidur thi sone .
42009042	And whanne he cam nyy , the deuel hurtlide hym doun , and to-braidide hym . And Jhesus blamyde ` the vnclene spirit , and heelide the child , and yeldide him to his fadir .
42009043	And alle men wondriden greetli in the gretnesse of God . And whanne alle men wondriden in alle thingis that he dide , he seide to hise disciplis ,
42009044	Putte ye these wordis in youre hertis , for it is to come , that mannus sone be bitrayed in to the hondis of men .
42009045	And thei knewen not this word , and it was hid bifor hem , that thei feeliden it not ; and thei dredden to axe hym of this word .
42009046	But a thouyt entride in to hem , who of hem schulde be grettest .
42009047	And Jhesu , seynge the thouytis of the herte of hem , took a child , and settide hym bisidis hym ;
42009048	and seide to hem , Who euer resseyueth this child in my name , resseyueth me ; and who euer resseyueth me , resseiueth him that sente me ; for he that is leest among you alle , is the grettest .
42009049	And Joon answeride and seide , Comaundoure , we sayn a man castynge out feendis in thi name , and we han forbedun hym , for he sueth not thee with vs .
42009050	And Jhesus seide to hym , Nyle ye forbede , for he that is not ayens vs , is for vs .
42009051	And it was don , whanne the daies of his takyng vp weren fulfillid , he settide faste his face , to go to Jerusalem ,
42009052	and sente messangeris bifor his siyt . And thei yeden , and entriden in to a citee of Samaritans , to make redi to hym .
42009053	And thei resseyueden not hym , for the face ` was of hym goynge in to Jerusalem .
42009054	And whanne James and Joon , hise disciplis , seyn , thei seiden , Lord , wolt thou that we seien , that fier come doun fro heuene , and waste hem ?
42009055	And he turnede , and blamyde hem , and seide , Ye witen not , whos spiritis ye ben ;
42009056	for mannus sone cam not to leese mennus soulis , but to saue . And thei wenten in to another castel .
42009057	And it was don , whanne thei walkeden in the weie , a man seide to hym , Y schal sue thee , whidur euer thou go .
42009058	And Jhesus seide to hym , Foxis han dennes , and briddis of the eir han nestis , but mannus sone hath not where he reste his heed .
42009059	And he seide to another , Sue thou me . And he seide , Lord , suffre me first to go , and birie my fadir .
42009060	And Jhesus seide to hym , Suffre that deede men birie hir deede men ; but go thou , and telle the kyngdom of God .
42009061	And another seide , Lord , Y schal sue thee , but first suffre me to leeue ` alle thingis that ben at hoom .
42009062	And Jhesus seide to hym , No man that puttith his hoond to the plouy , and biholdynge bacward , is able to the rewme of God .
42010001	And aftir these thingis the Lord Jhesu ordeynede also othir seuenti and tweyn , and sente hem bi tweyn and tweyn bifor his face in to euery citee and place , whidir he was to come .
42010002	And he seide to hem , There is myche ripe corn , and fewe werke men ; therfor preie ye the lord of the ripe corn , that he sende werke men in to his ripe corn .
42010003	Go ye , lo ! Y sende you as lambren among wolues .
42010004	Therfor nyle ye bere a sachel , nethir scrippe , nethir schoon , and greete ye no man bi the weie .
42010005	In to what hous that ye entren , first seie ye , Pees to this hous .
42010006	And if a sone of pees be there , youre pees schal reste on hym ; but if noon , it schal turne ayen to you .
42010007	And dwelle ye in the same hous , etynge and drynkynge tho thingis that ben at hem ; for a werk man is worthi his hire . Nyle ye passe from hous in to hous .
42010008	And in to what euer citee ye entren , and thei resseyuen you , ete ye tho thingis that ben set to you ;
42010009	and heele ye the sijke men that ben in that citee . And seie ye to hem , The kyngdom of God schal neiye in to you .
42010010	In to what citee ye entren , and thei resseyuen you not , go ye out in to the streetis of it ,
42010011	and seie ye , We wipen of ayens you the poudir that cleued to vs of youre citee ; netheles wite ye this thing , that the rewme of God schal come nyy .
42010012	Y seie to you , that to Sodom it schal be esiere than to that citee in that dai .
42010013	Wo to thee , Corosayn ; wo to thee , Bethsaida ; for if in Tyre and Sidon the vertues hadden be don , whiche han be don in you , sum tyme thei wolden haue sete in heyre and asches , and haue don penaunce .
42010014	Netheles to Tire and Sidon it schal be esiere in the doom than to you .
42010015	And thou , Cafarnaum , art enhaunsid ` til to heuene ; thou schalt be drenchid ` til in to helle .
42010016	He that herith you , herith me ; and he that dispisith you , dispisith me ; and he that dispisith me , dispisith hym that sente me .
42010017	And the two and seuenti disciplis turneden ayen with ioye , and seiden , Lord , also deuelis ben suget to vs in thi name .
42010018	And he seide to hem , Y saiy Sathnas fallynge doun fro heuene , as leit .
42010019	And lo ! Y haue youun to you power to trede on serpentis , and on scorpyouns , and on al the vertu of the enemy , and nothing schal anoye you .
42010020	Netheles nyle ye ioye on this thing , that spiritis ben suget to you ; but ioye ye , that youre names ben writun in heuenes .
42010021	In thilk our he gladide in the Hooli Goost , and seide , Y knouleche to thee , fadir , Lord of heuene and of erthe , for thou hast hid these thingis fro wise men and prudent , and hast schewid hem to smale children . Yhe , fadir , for so it pleside bifor thee .
42010022	Alle thingis ben youun to me of my fadir , and no man woot , who is the sone , but the fadir ; and who is the fadir , but the sone , and to whom the sone wole schewe .
42010023	And he turnede to hise disciplis , and seide , Blessid ben the iyen , that seen tho thingis that ye seen .
42010024	For Y seie to you , that many prophetis and kyngis wolden haue seie tho thingis , that ye seen , and thei sayn not ; and here tho thingis , that ye heren , and thei herden not .
42010025	And lo ! a wise man of the lawe ros vp , temptynge hym , and seiynge , Maister , what thing schal Y do to haue euerlastynge lijf ?
42010026	And he seide to hym , What is writun in the lawe ? hou redist thou ?
42010027	He answeride , and seide , Thou schalt loue thi Lord God of al thin herte , and of al thi soule , and of alle thi strengthis , and of al thi mynde ; and thi neiybore as thi silf .
42010028	And Jhesus seide to hym , Thou hast answerid riytli ; do this thing , and thou schalt lyue .
42010029	But he willynge to iustifie hym silf , seide to Jhesu , And who is my neiybore ?
42010030	And Jhesu biheld , and seide , A man cam doun fro Jerusalem in to Jerico , and fel among theues , and thei robbiden hym , and woundiden hym , and wente awei , and leften the man half alyue .
42010031	And it bifel , that a prest cam doun the same weie , and passide forth , whanne he hadde seyn hym .
42010032	Also a dekene , whanne he was bisidis the place , and saiy him , passide forth .
42010033	But a Samaritan , goynge the weie , cam bisidis hym ; and he siy hym , and hadde reuthe on hym ;
42010034	and cam to hym , and boond togidir hise woundis , and helde in oyle and wynne ; and leide hym on his beest , and ledde in to an ostrie , and dide the cure of hym .
42010035	And another dai he brouyte forth twey pans , and yaf to the ostiler , and seide , Haue the cure of hym ; and what euer thou schalt yyue ouer , Y schal yelde to thee , whanne Y come ayen .
42010036	Who of these thre , semeth to thee , was neiybore to hym , that fel among theues ?
42010037	And he seide , He that dide merci in to hym . And Jhesus seide to hym , Go thou , and do thou on lijk maner .
42010038	And it was don , while thei wenten , he entride in to a castel ; and a womman , Martha bi name , resseyuede hym in to hir hous .
42010039	And to this was a sistir , Marie bi name , which also sat bisidis the feet of the Lord , and herde his word .
42010040	But Martha bisiede aboute the ofte seruyce . And sche stood , and seide , Lord , takist thou no kepe , that my sistir hath left me aloone to serue ? therfor seie thou to hir , that sche helpe me .
42010041	And the Lord answerde , and seide to hir , Martha , Martha , thou art bysi , and art troublid aboute ful many thingis ;
42010042	but o thing is necessarie . Marie hath chosun the best part , which schal not be takun awei fro hir .
42011001	And it was don , whanne he was preiynge in a place , as he ceesside , oon of hise disciplis seide to hym , Lord , teche vs to preye , as Joon tauyte hise disciplis .
42011002	And he seide to hem , Whanne ye preien , seie ye , Fadir , halewid be thi name . Thi kyngdom come to .
42011003	Yyue ` to vs to dai oure ech daies breed .
42011004	And foryyue to vs oure synnes , as we foryyuen to ech man that owith to vs . And lede vs not in to temptacioun .
42011005	And he seide to hem , Who of you schal haue a freend , and schal go to hym at mydnyyt , and schal seie to hym , Freend , leene to me thre looues ;
42011006	for my freend cometh to me fro the weie , and Y haue not what Y schal sette bifor hym .
42011007	And he with ynforth answere and seie , Nyle thou be heuy to me ; the dore is now schit , and my children ben with me in bed ; Y may not rise , and yyue to thee .
42011008	And if he schal dwelle stil knockynge , Y seie to you , thouy he schal not rise , and yyue to him , for that that he is his freend , netheles for his contynuel axyng he schal ryse , and yyue to hym , as many as he hath nede to .
42011009	And Y seie to you , axe ye , and it schal be youun to you ; seke ye , and ye schulen fynde ; knocke ye , and it schal be openyd to you .
42011010	For ech that axith , takith , and he that sekith , fyndith ; and to a man that knockith , it schal be openyd .
42011011	Therfor who of you axith his fadir breed , whether he schal yyue hym a stoon ? or if he axith fisch , whether he schal yyue hym a serpent for the fisch ?
42011012	or if he axe an eye , whether he schal a reche hym a scorpioun ?
42011013	Therfor if ye , whanne ye ben yuel , kunnen yyue good yiftis to youre children , hou myche more youre fadir of heuene schal yyue a good spirit to men that axith him .
42011014	And Jhesus was castynge out a feend , and he was doumbe . And whanne he hadde cast out the feend , the doumbe man spak ; and the puple wondride .
42011015	And sum of hem seiden , In Belsabub , prince of deuelis , he castith out deuelis .
42011016	And othir temptinge axiden of hym a tokene fro heuene .
42011017	And as he saiy the thouytis of hem , he seide to hem , Euery rewme departid ayens it silf , schal be desolat , and an hous schal falle on an hous .
42011018	And if Sathanas be departid ayens hym silf , hou schal his rewme stonde ? For ye seien , that Y caste out feendis in Belsabub .
42011019	And if Y in Belsabub caste out fendis , in whom casten out youre sones ? Therfor thei schulen be youre domesmen .
42011020	But if Y caste out fendis in the fyngir of God , thanne the rewme of God is comun among you .
42011021	Whanne a strong armed man kepith his hous , alle thingis that he weldith ben in pees .
42011022	But if a stronger than he come vpon hym , and ouercome hym , he schal take awei al his armere , in which he tristide , and schal dele abrood his robries .
42011023	He that is not with me , is ayens me ; and he that gederith not togidir with me , scaterith abrood .
42011024	Whanne an vnclene spirit goith out of a man , he wandrith bi drie placis , and sekith reste ; and he fyndynge not , seith , Y schal turne ayen in to myn hous , fro whannes Y cam out .
42011025	And whanne he cometh , he fyndith it clansid with besyms , and fayre arayed .
42011026	Thanne he goith , and takith with hym seuene othere spirits worse than hym silf , and thei entren , and dwellen there . And the laste thingis of that man ben maad worse than the formere .
42011027	And it was don , whanne he hadde seid these thingis , a womman of the cumpanye reride hir vois , and seide to hym , Blessid be the wombe that bare thee , and blessid be the tetis that thou hast soken .
42011028	And he seide , But yhe blessid be thei , that heren the word of God , and kepen it .
42011029	And whanne the puple runnen togidere , he bigan to seie , This generacioun is a weiward generacioun ; it sekith a token , and a tokene schal not be youun to it , but the tokene of Jonas , the profete .
42011030	For as Jonas was a tokene to men of Nynyue , so mannus sone schal be to this generacioun .
42011031	The queen of the south schal rise in doom with men of this generacioun , and schal condempne hem ; for sche cam fro the endis of the erthe , for to here the wisdom of Salomon , and lo ! here is a gretter than Salomon .
42011032	Men of Nynyue schulen rise in doom with this generacioun , and schulen condempne it ; for thei diden penaunce in the prechyng of Jonas , and lo ! here is a gretter than Jonas .
42011033	No man tendith a lanterne , and puttith in hidils , nether vndur a buyschel , but on a candilstike , that thei that goen in , se liyt .
42011034	The lanterne of thi bodi is thin iye ; if thin iye be symple , al thi bodi schal be liyti ; but if it be weyward , al thi bodi schal be derkful .
42011035	Therfor se thou , lest the liyt that is in thee , be derknessis .
42011036	Therfor if al thi bodi be briyt , and haue no part of derknessis , it schal be al briyt , and as a lanterne of briytnesse it schal yyue liyt to thee .
42011037	And whanne he spak , a Farisee preiede him , that he schulde ete with hym . And he entride , and sat to the meete .
42011038	And the Farisee bigan to seie , gessynge with ynne hym silf , whi he was not waschen bifor mete .
42011039	And the Lord seide to hym , Now ye Farisees clensen that that is with outenforth of the cuppe and the plater ; but that thing that is with ynne of you , is ful of raueyn and wickidnesse .
42011040	Foolis , whether he that made that that is withoutenforth , made not also that that is with ynne ?
42011041	Netheles that that is ouer plus , yyue ye almes , and lo ! alle thingis ben cleene to you .
42011042	But wo to you , Farisees , that tithen mynte , and rue , and ech eerbe , and leeuen doom and the charite of God . For it bihofte to do these thingis , and not leeue tho .
42011043	Wo to you , Farisees , that louen the firste chaieris in synagogis , and salutaciouns in chepyng .
42011044	Wo to you , that ben as sepulcris , that ben not seyn , and men walkynge aboue witen not .
42011045	But oon of the wise men of the lawe answeride , and seide to hym , Maystir , thou seiynge these thingis , also to vs doist dispit .
42011046	And he seide , Also wo to you , wise men of lawe , for ye chargen men with birthuns which thei moun not bere , and ye you silf with youre o fyngur touchen not the heuynessis .
42011047	Wo to you , that bilden toumbis of profetis ; and youre fadris slowen hem .
42011048	Treuli ye witnessen , that ye consenten to the werkis of youre fadris ; for thei slowen hem , but ye bilden her sepulcris .
42011049	Therfor the wisdom of God seide , Y schal sende to hem profetis and apostlis , and of hem thei schulen sle and pursue ,
42011050	that the blood of alle prophetis , that was sched fro the making of the world , be souyt of this generacioun ;
42011051	fro the blood of the iust Abel to the blood of Zacharie , that was slayn bitwixe the auter and the hous . So Y seie to you , it schal be souyt of this generacioun .
42011052	Wo to you , wise men of the lawe , for ye han takun awei the keye of kunnyng ; and ye yow silf entriden not , and ye han forbeden hem that entriden .
42011053	And whanne he seide these thingis to hem , the Farisees and wise men of lawe bigunnen greuousli to ayenstonde , and stoppe his mouth of many thingis ,
42011054	aspiynge hym , and sekynge to take sum thing of his mouth , to accuse hym .
42012001	And whanne myche puple stood aboute , so that thei treden ech on othir , he bigan to seie to hise disciplis , Be ye war of the sourdouy of the Farisees , that is ypocrisie .
42012002	For no thing is hilid , that schal not be schewid ; nether hid , that schal not be wist .
42012003	For whi tho thingis that ye han seid in derknessis , schulen be seid in liyt ; and that that ye han spokun in eere in the couchis , schal be prechid in roofes .
42012004	And Y seie to you , my freendis , be ye not a ferd of hem that sleen the bodie , and aftir these thingis han no more what thei schulen do .
42012005	But Y schal schewe to you , whom ye schulen drede ; drede ye hym , that aftir he hath slayn , he hath power to sende in to helle . And so Y seie to you , drede ye hym .
42012006	Whether fyue sparowis ben not seld for twei halpens ; and oon of hem is not in foryetyng bifor God ?
42012007	But also alle the heeris of youre heed ben noumbrid . Therfor nyle ye drede ; ye ben of more prijs than many sparowis .
42012008	Treuli Y seie to you , ech man that knoulechith me bifor men , mannus sone schal knouleche hym bifor the aungels of God .
42012009	But he that denyeth me bifor men , schal be denyed bifor the aungels of God .
42012010	And ech that seith a word ayens mannus sone , it schal be foryouun to hym ; but it schal not be foryouun to hym , that blasfemeth ayens the Hooli Goost .
42012011	And whanne thei leden you in to synagogis , and to magistratis , and potestatis , nyle ye ` be bisie , hou or what ye schulen answere , or what ye schulen seie .
42012012	For the Hooli Goost schal teche you in that our , what it bihoueth you to seie .
42012013	And oon of the puple seide to hym , Maystir , seie to my brothir , that he departe with me the eritage .
42012014	And he seyde to hym , Man , who ordeynede me a domesman , or a departere , on you ?
42012015	And he seide to hem , Se ye , and be ye war of al coueytice ; for the lijf of a man is not in the abundaunce of tho thingis , whiche he weldith .
42012016	And he tolde to hem a liknesse , and seide , The feeld of a riche man brouyte forth plenteuouse fruytis .
42012017	And he thouyte with ynne hym silf , and seide , What schal Y do , for Y haue not whidur Y schal gadere my fruytis ?
42012018	And he seith , This thing Y schal do ; Y schal throwe doun my bernes , and Y schal make gretter , and thidir Y schal gadir alle thingis that growen to me , and my goodis .
42012019	And Y schal seie to my soule , Soule , thou hast many goodis kept in to ful many yeeris ; rest thou , ete , drynke , and make feeste .
42012020	And God seide to hym , Fool , in this nyyt thei schulen take thi lijf fro thee . And whos schulen tho thingis be , that thou hast arayed ?
42012021	So is he that tresourith to hym silf , and is not riche in God .
42012022	And he seide to hise disciplis , Therfor Y seie to you , nyle ye be bisy to youre lijf , what ye schulen ete , nether to youre bodi , with what ye schulen be clothid .
42012023	The lijf is more than mete , and the body more than clothing .
42012024	Biholde ye crowis , for thei sowen not , nethir repen , to whiche is no celer , ne berne , and God fedith hem . Hou myche more ye ben of more prijs than thei .
42012025	And who of you bithenkynge may put to o cubit to his stature ?
42012026	Therfor if ye moun not that that is leest , what ben ye bisie of othere thingis ?
42012027	Biholde ye the lilies of the feeld , hou thei wexen ; thei trauelen not , nethir spynnen . And Y seie to you , that nethir Salomon in al his glorie was clothid as oon of these .
42012028	And if God clothith thus the hey , that to dai is in the feeld , and to morewe is cast in to an ouen ; hou myche more you of litil feith .
42012029	And nyle ye seke , what ye schulen ete , or what ye schulen drynke ; and nyle ye be reisid an hiy .
42012030	For folkis of the world seken alle these thingis ; ` and your fadir woot , that ye neden alle these thingis .
42012031	Netheles seke ye first the kyngdom of God , and alle these thingis schulen be caste to you .
42012032	Nile ye , litil flok , drede , for it pleside to youre fadir to yyue you a kyngdom .
42012033	Selle ye tho thingis that ye han in possessioun , and yyue ye almes . And make to you sachels that wexen not oolde , tresoure that failith not in heuenes , whidir a theef neiyith not , nether mouyt destruyeth .
42012034	For where is thi tresoure , there thin herte schal be .
42012035	Be youre leendis gird aboue , and lanternes brennynge in youre hoondis ;
42012036	and be ye lijk to men that abiden her lord , whanne he schal turne ayen fro the weddyngis , that whanne he schal come , and knocke , anoon thei openen to hym .
42012037	Blessid be tho seruauntis , that whanne the lord schal come , he schal fynde wakynge . Treuli Y seie to you , that he schal girde hym silf , and make hem sitte to mete , and he schal go , and serue hem .
42012038	And if he come in the secounde wakynge , and if he come in the thridde wakynge , and fynde so , tho seruauntis ben blessid .
42012039	And wite ye this thing , for if an hosebonde man wiste , in what our the theef wolde come , sotheli he schulde wake , and not suffre his hous to be myned .
42012040	And be ye redi , for in what our ye gessen not , mannus sone schal come .
42012041	And Petre seide to hym , Lord , seist thou this parable to vs , or to alle ?
42012042	And the Lord seide , Who , gessist thou , is a trewe dispendere , and a prudent , whom the lord hath ordeyned on his meyne , to yyue hem in tyme mesure of whete ?
42012043	Blessid is that seruaunt , that the lord whanne he cometh , schal fynde so doynge .
42012044	Verili Y seie to you , that on alle thingis that he weldith , he schal ordeyne hym .
42012045	That if that seruaunt seie in his herte , My lord tarieth to come ; and bigynne to smyte children , and handmaydenes , and ete , and drynke , and be fulfillid ouer mesure ,
42012046	the lord of that seruaunt schal come , in the dai that he hopith not , and the our that he woot not ; and schal departe hym , and putte his part with vnfeithful men .
42012047	But thilke seruaunt that knew the wille of his lord , and made not hym redi , and dide not aftir his wille , schal be betun with many betyngis .
42012048	But he that knew not , and dide worthi thingis of strokis , schal be betun with fewe . For to eche man to whom myche is youun , myche schal be axid of hym ; and thei schulen axe more of hym , to whom thei bitoken myche .
42012049	Y cam to sende fier ` in to the erthe , and what wole Y , but that it be kyndlid ?
42012050	And Y haue to be baptisid with a baptysm , and hou am Y constreyned , til that it be perfitli don ?
42012051	Wene ye , that Y cam to yyue pees in to erthe ? Nay , Y say to you , but departyng .
42012052	For fro this tyme ther schulen be fyue departid in oon hous ; thre schulen be departid ayens tweyne , and tweyne schulen be departid ayens thre ;
42012053	the fadir ayens the sone , and the sone ayens the fadir ; the modir ayens the douytir , and the douytir ayens the modir ; the hosebondis modir ayens the sones wijf , and and the sones wijf ayens hir hosebondis modir .
42012054	And he seide also to the puple , Whanne ye seen a cloude risynge fro the sunne goynge doun , anoon ye seien , Reyn cometh ; and so it is don .
42012055	And whanne ye seen the south blowynge , ye seien , That heete schal be ; and it is don .
42012056	Ypocritis , ye kunnen preue the face of heuene and of erthe , but hou preuen ye not this tyme .
42012057	But what and of you silf ye demen not that that is iust ?
42012058	But whanne thou goist with thin aduersarie in the weie to the prince , do bisynesse to be delyuerid fro hym ; lest perauenture he take thee to the domesman , and the domesman bitake thee to the maistirful axer , and the maistirful axer sende thee in to prisoun .
42012059	Y seie to thee , thou schalt not go fro thennus , til thou yelde the laste ferthing .
42013001	And sum men weren present in that tyme , that telden to hym of the Galileis , whos blood Pilat myngide with the sacrificis of hem .
42013002	And he answeride , and seide to hem , Wenen ye , that these men of Galile weren synneris more than alle Galilees , for thei suffriden siche thingis ?
42013003	Y seie to you , nay ; alle ye schulen perische in lijk manere , but ye han penaunce .
42013004	And as tho eiytetene , on which the toure in Siloa fel doun , and slowe hem , gessen ye , for thei weren dettouris more than alle men that dwellen in Jerusalem ?
42013005	Y seie to you , nai ; but also ` ye alle schulen perische , if ye doon not penaunce .
42013006	And he seide this liknesse , A man hadde a fige tre plauntid in his vynyerd , and he cam sekynge fruyt in it , and foond noon .
42013007	And he seide to the tilier of the vynyerd , Lo ! thre yeeris ben , sithen Y come sekynge fruyt in this fige tre , and Y fynde noon ; therfor kitte it doun , whereto ocupieth it the erthe ?
42013008	And he answerynge seide to hym , Lord , suffre it also this yeer , the while Y delue aboute it , and Y schal donge it ;
42013009	if it schal make fruyt , if nay , in tyme comynge thou schalt kitte it doun .
42013010	And he was techinge in her synagoge in the sabatis .
42013011	And lo ! a womman , that hadde a spirit of sijknesse eiytene yeeris , and was crokid , and ` nethir ony maner myyte loke vpward .
42013012	Whom whanne Jhesus hadde seyn , he clepide to hym , and seide to hir , Womman , thou art delyuerid of thi sijknesse .
42013013	And he settide on hir his hoondis , and anoon sche stood upriyt , and glorifiede God .
42013014	And the prince of the synagoge answerde , hauynge dedeyn for Jhesus hadde heelid in the sabat ; and he seide to the puple , Ther ben sixe dayes , in whiche it bihoueth to worche ; therfor come ye in these , and ` be ye heelid , and not in the daie of sabat .
42013015	But the Lord answeride to hym , and seide , Ypocrite , whether ech of you vntieth not in the sabat his oxe , or asse , fro the cratche , and ledith to watir ?
42013016	Bihofte it not this douytir of Abraham , whom Satanas hath boundun , lo ! eiytetene yeeris , to be vnboundun of this boond in the dai of the sabat ?
42013017	And whanne he seide these thingis , alle hise aduersaries weren aschamed , and al the puple ioiede in alle thingis , that weren gloriousli don of hym .
42013018	Therfor he seide , To what thing is the kyngdom of God lijk ? and to what thing schal Y gesse it to be lijk ?
42013019	It is lijk to a corn of seneuey , which a man took , and cast in to his yerd ; and it wax , and was maad in to a greet tree , and foulis of the eire restiden in the braunchis therof .
42013020	And eft soone he seide , To what thing schal Y gesse the kyngdom of God lijk ?
42013021	It is lijk to sourdouy , that a womman took , and hidde it ` in to thre mesuris of mele , til al were sourid .
42013022	And he wente bi citees and castels , techynge and makynge a iourney in to Jerusalem .
42013023	And a man seide to hym , Lord , if there ben fewe , that ben saued ? And he seide to hem ,
42013024	Stryue ye to entre bi the streite yate ; for Y seie to you , many seken to entre , and thei schulen not mowe .
42013025	For whanne the hosebonde man is entrid , and the dore is closid , ye schulen bigynne to stonde with out forth , and knocke at the dore , and seie , Lord , opyn to vs . And he schal answere , and seie to you , Y knowe you not , of whennus ye ben .
42013026	Thanne ye schulen bigynne to seye , We han etun bifor thee and drunkun , and in oure streetis thou hast tauyt .
42013027	And he schal seie to you , Y know you not , of whennus ye ben ; go awei fro me , alle ye worcheris of wickidnesse .
42013028	There schal be wepyng and gruntyng of teeth , whanne ye schulen se Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , and alle the prophetis in the kyngdom of God ; and you to be put out .
42013029	And thei schulen come fro the eest and west , and fro the north and south , and schulen sitte ` at the mete in the rewme of God .
42013030	And lo ! thei that weren the firste , ben the laste ; and thei that weren the laste , ben the firste .
42013031	In that day sum of the Farisees camen nyy , and seiden to hym , Go out , and go fro hennus , for Eroude wole sle thee .
42013032	And he seide to hem , Go ye , and seie to that foxe , Lo ! Y caste out feendis , and Y make perfitli heelthis , to dai and to morew , and the thridde dai Y am endid .
42013033	Netheles it bihoueth me to dai , and to morewe , and the dai that sueth , to walke ; for it fallith not a profete to perische out of Jerusalem .
42013034	Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that sleest profetis , and stonest hem that ben sent to thee , hou ofte wolde Y gadre togider thi sones , as a brid gaderith his nest vndur fethris , and thou woldist not .
42013035	Lo ! youre hous schal be left to you desert . And Y seie to you , that ye schulen not se me , til it come , whanne ye schulen seie , Blessid is he , that cometh in the name of the Lord .
42014001	And it was don , whanne he hadde entrid in to the hous of a prince of Farisees , in the sabat , to ete breed , thei aspieden hym .
42014002	And lo ! a man sijk in the dropesie was bifor hym .
42014003	And Jhesus answerynge spak to the wise men of lawe , and to the Farisees , and seide , Whethir it is leeueful to heele in the sabat ?
42014004	And thei helden pees . And Jhesus took , and heelide hym , and let hym go .
42014005	And he answeride to hem , and seide , Whos asse or oxe of you schal falle in to a pit , and ` he schal not anoon drawe hym out in the dai of the sabat ?
42014006	And thei myyten not answere to hym to these thingis .
42014007	He seide also a parable to men bodun to a feeste , and biheld hou thei chesen the first sittyng placis , and seide to hem ,
42014008	Whanne thou art bodun to bridalis , sitte not ` at the mete in the firste place ; lest perauenture a worthier than thou be bodun of hym ,
42014009	and lest he come that clepide thee and hym , and seie to thee , Yyue place to this , and thanne thou schalt bigynne with schame to holde the lowest place .
42014010	But whanne thou art bedun to a feste , go , and sitte doun in the laste place , that whanne he cometh , that bad thee to the feeste , he seie to thee , Freend , come hiyer . Thanne worschip schal be to thee , bifor men that sitten at the mete .
42014011	For ech that enhaunsith hym , schal be lowid ; and he that meketh hym , schal be hiyed .
42014012	And he seide to hym , that hadde bodun hym to the feeste , Whanne thou makist a mete , or a soper , nyle thou clepe thi freendis , nether thi britheren , nethir cosyns , nethir neiyboris , ne riche men ; lest perauenture thei bidde thee ayen to the feeste , and it be yolde ayen to thee .
42014013	But whanne thou makist a feeste , clepe pore men ,
42014014	feble , crokid , and blynde , and thou schalt be blessid ; for thei han not wherof to yelde thee , for it schal be yoldun to thee in the risyng ayen of iust men .
42014015	And whanne oon of hem that saten togider at the mete hadde herd these thingis , he seide to hym , Blessid is he , that schal ete breed in the rewme of God .
42014016	And he seide to hym , A man made a greet soper , and clepide many .
42014017	And he sent his seruaunt in the our of soper , to seie to men that weren bodun to the feeste , that thei schulden come , for now alle thingis ben redi .
42014018	And alle bigunnen togidir to excusen hem . The firste seide , Y haue bouyt a toun , and Y haue nede to go out , and se it ; Y preye thee , haue me excusid .
42014019	And the tother seide , Y haue bouyt fyue yockis of oxun , and Y go to preue hem ; Y preye thee , haue me excusid .
42014020	And an othir seide , Y haue weddid a wijf ; and therfor Y may not come .
42014021	And the seruaunt turnede ayen , and tolde these thingis to his lord . Thanne the hosebonde man was wrooth , and seide to his seruaunt , Go out swithe in to the grete stretis and smal stretis of the citee , and brynge ynne hidir pore men , and feble , blynde , and crokid .
42014022	And the seruaunt seide , Lord , it is don , as thou hast comaundid , and yit there is a void place .
42014023	And the lord seide to the seruaunt , Go out in to weies and heggis , and constreine men to entre , that myn hous be fulfillid .
42014024	For Y seie to you , that noon of tho men that ben clepid , schal taaste my soper .
42014025	And myche puple wenten with hym ; and he turnede , and seide to hem ,
42014026	If ony man cometh to me , and hatith not his fadir , and modir , and wijf , and sones , and britheren , and sistris , and yit his owne lijf , he may not be my disciple .
42014027	And he that berith not his cross , and cometh aftir me , may not be my disciple .
42014028	For who of you willynge to bilde a toure , whether he ` first sitte not , and countith the spensis that ben nedeful , if he haue to perfourme ?
42014029	Lest aftir that he hath set the foundement , and mowe not perfourme , alle that seen , bigynnen to scorne hym , and seie , For this man bigan to bilde ,
42014030	and myyte not make an ende .
42014031	Or what kyng that wole go to do a bataile ayens anothir kyng , whether he sittith not first , and bithenkith , if he may with ten thousynde go ayens hym that cometh ayens hym with twenti thousynde ?
42014032	Ellis yit while he is afer , he sendynge a messanger , preieth tho thingis that ben of pees .
42014033	So therfor ech of you , that forsakith not alle thingis that he hath , may not be my disciple .
42014034	Salt is good ; but if salt vanysche , in what thing schal it be sauerid ?
42014035	Nethir in erthe , nethir in donghille it is profitable , but it schal be cast out . He that hath eeris of herynge , here he .
42015001	And pupplicans and synful men weren neiyynge to him , to here hym .
42015002	And the Farisees and scribis grutchiden , seiynge , For this resseyueth synful men , and etith with hem .
42015003	And he spak to hem this parable ,
42015004	and seide , What man of you that hath an hundrith scheep , and if he hath lost oon of hem , whethir he leeueth not nynti and nyne in desert , and goith to it that perischide , til he fynde it ?
42015005	And whanne he hath foundun it , he ioieth , and leyith it on hise schuldris ; and he cometh hoom ,
42015006	and clepith togidir hise freendis and neiyboris , and seith to hem , Be ye glad with me , for Y haue founde my scheep , that hadde perischid .
42015007	And Y seie to you , so ioye schal be in heuene on o synful man doynge penaunce , more than on nynti and nyne iuste , that han no nede to penaunce .
42015008	Or what womman hauynge ten besauntis , and if sche hath lost oo besaunt , whether sche teendith not a lanterne , and turneth vpsodoun the hows , and sekith diligentli , til that sche fynde it ?
42015009	And whanne sche hath foundun , sche clepith togidir freendis and neiyboris , and seith , Be ye glad with me , for Y haue founde the besaunt , that Y hadde lost .
42015010	So Y seie to you , ioye schal be bifor aungels of God on o synful man doynge penaunce .
42015011	And he seide , A man hadde twei sones ;
42015012	and the yonger of hem seide to the fadir , Fadir , yyue me the porcioun of catel , that fallith to me . And he departide to hem the catel .
42015013	And not aftir many daies , whanne alle thingis weren gederid togider , the yonger sone wente forth in pilgrymage in to a fer cuntre ; and there he wastide hise goodis in lyuynge lecherously .
42015014	And aftir that he hadde endid alle thingis , a strong hungre was maad in that cuntre , and he bigan to haue nede .
42015015	And he wente , and drouy hym to oon of the citeseyns of that cuntre . And he sente hym in to his toun , to fede swyn .
42015016	And he coueitide to fille his wombe of the coddis that the hoggis eeten , and no man yaf hym .
42015017	And he turnede ayen to hym silf , and seide , Hou many hirid men in my fadir hous han plente of looues ; and Y perische here thorouy hungir .
42015018	Y schal rise vp , and go to my fadir , and Y schal seie to hym , Fadir , Y haue synned in to heuene , and bifor thee ;
42015019	and now Y am not worthi to be clepid thi sone , make me as oon of thin hirid men .
42015020	And he roos vp , and cam to his fadir . And whanne he was yit afer , his fadir saiy hym , and was stirrid bi mercy . And he ran , and fel on his necke , and kisside hym .
42015021	And the sone seide to hym , Fadir , Y haue synned in to heuene , and bifor thee ; and now Y am not worthi to be clepid thi sone .
42015022	And the fadir seide to hise seruauntis , Swithe brynge ye forth the firste stoole , and clothe ye hym , and yyue ye a ryng in his hoond ,
42015023	and schoon on hise feet ; and brynge ye a fat calf , and sle ye , and ete we , and make we feeste .
42015024	For this my sone was deed , and hath lyued ayen ; he perischid , and is foundun . And alle men bigunnen to ete .
42015025	But his eldere sone was in the feeld ; and whanne he cam , and neiyede to the hous , he herde a symfonye and a croude .
42015026	And he clepide oon of the seruauntis , and axide , what these thingis weren .
42015027	And he seide to hym , Thi brother is comun , and thi fadir slewe a fat calf , for he resseyuede hym saaf .
42015028	And he was wrooth , and wolde not come in . Therfor his fadir wente out , and bigan to preye hym .
42015029	And he answerde to his fadir , and seide , Lo ! so many yeeris Y serue thee , and Y neuer brak thi comaundement ; and thou neuer yaf to me a kidde , that Y with my freendis schulde haue ete .
42015030	But aftir that this thi sone , that hath deuourid his substaunce with horis , cam , thou hast slayn to hym a fat calf .
42015031	And he seide to hym , Sone , thou art euer more with me , and alle my thingis ben thine .
42015032	But it bihofte for to make feeste , and to haue ioye ; for this thi brother was deed , and lyuede ayen ; he perischide , and is foundun .
42016001	He seide also to hise disciplis , Ther was a riche man , that hadde a baili ; and this was defamed to him , as he hadde wastid his goodis .
42016002	And he clepide hym , and seide to hym , What here Y this thing of thee ? yelde reckynyng of thi baili , for thou miyte not now be baili .
42016003	And the baili seide with ynne him silf , What schal Y do , for my lord takith awei fro me the baili ? delfe mai Y not , I schame to begge .
42016004	Y woot what Y schal do , that whanne Y am remeued fro the baili , thei resseyue me in to her hous .
42016005	Therfor whanne alle the dettours of his lord weren clepid togider , he seide to the firste , Hou myche owist thou to my lord ?
42016006	And he seide , An hundrid barelis of oyle . And he seide to hym , Take thi caucioun , and sitte soone , and write fifti .
42016007	Aftirward he seide to another , And hou myche owist thou ? Which answerde , An hundrid coris of whete . And he seide to hym , Take thi lettris , and write foure scoore .
42016008	And the lord preiside the baili of wickydnesse , for he hadde do prudentli ; for the sones of this world ben more prudent in her generacioun than the sones of liyt .
42016009	And Y seie to you , make ye to you freendis of the ritchesse of wickidnesse , that whanne ye schulen fayle , thei resseyue you in to euerlastynge tabernaclis .
42016010	He that is trewe in the leeste thing , is trewe also in the more ; and he that is wickid in a litil thing , is wickid also in the more .
42016011	Therfor if ye weren not trewe in the wickid thing of ritchesse , who schal bitake to you that that is verry ?
42016012	And if ye weren not trewe in othere mennus thing , who schal yyue to you that that is youre ?
42016013	No seruaunt may serue to twei lordis ; for ether he schal hate ` the toon , and loue the tothir ; ethir he schal drawe to ` the toon , and schal dispise the tothir . Ye moun not serue to God and to ritchesse .
42016014	But the Farisees , that weren coueytous , herden alle these thingis , and thei scorneden hym .
42016015	And he seide to hem , Ye it ben , that iustifien you bifor men ; but God hath knowun youre hertis , for that that is hiy to men , is abhomynacioun bifor God .
42016016	The lawe and prophetis til to Joon ; fro that tyme the rewme of God is euangelisid , and ech man doith violence in to it .
42016017	Forsothe it is liyter heuene and erthe to passe , than that o titil falle fro the lawe .
42016018	Euery man that forsakith his wijf , and weddith an other , doith letcherie ; and he that weddith the wijf forsakun of the hosebonde , doith auowtrie .
42016019	There was a riche man , and was clothid in purpur , and whit silk , and eete euery dai schynyngli .
42016020	And there was a begger , Lazarus bi name , that lai at his yate ful of bilis ,
42016021	and coueitide to be fulfillid of the crummes , that fellen doun fro the riche mannus boord , and no man yaf to hym ; but houndis camen , and lickiden hise bilis .
42016022	And it was don , that the begger diede , and was borun of aungels in to Abrahams bosum .
42016023	And the riche man was deed also , and was biried in helle . And he reiside hise iyen , whanne he was in turmentis , and say Abraham afer , and Lazarus in his bosum .
42016024	And he criede , and seide , Fadir Abraham , haue merci on me , and sende Lazarus , that he dippe the ende of his fyngur in watir , to kele my tunge ; for Y am turmentid in this flawme .
42016025	And Abraham seide to hym , Sone , haue mynde , for thou hast resseyued good thingis in thi lijf , and Lazarus also yuel thingis ; but he is now coumfortid , and thou art turmentid .
42016026	And in alle these thingis a greet derk place is stablischid betwixe vs and you ; that thei that wolen fro hennus passe to you , moun not , nethir fro thennus passe ouer hidur .
42016027	And he seide , Thanne Y preie thee , fadir , that thou sende hym in to the hous of my fadir .
42016028	For Y haue fyue britheren , that he witnesse to hem , lest also thei come in to this place of turmentis .
42016029	And Abraham seide to him , Thei han Moyses and the prophetis ; here thei hem .
42016030	And he seide , Nay , fadir Abraham , but if ony of deed men go to hem , thei schulen do penaunce .
42016031	And he seide to hym , If thei heren not Moises and prophetis , nethir if ony of deed men rise ayen , thei schulen bileue to hym .
42017001	And Jhesu seide to hise disciplis , It is impossible that sclaundris come not ; but wo to that man , bi whom thei comen .
42017002	It is more profitable to him , if a mylne stoon be put aboute his necke , and he be cast in to the see , than that he sclaundre oon of these litle .
42017003	Take ye hede you silf ; if thi brothir hath synned ayens thee , blame hym ; and if he do penaunce , foryyue hym .
42017004	And if seuene sithis in the dai he do synne ayens thee , and seuene sithis in the dai he be conuertid to thee , and seie , It forthenkith me , foryyue thou hym .
42017005	And the apostlis seiden to the Lord , Encrese to vs feith .
42017006	And the Lord seide , If ye han feith as the corn of seneuei , ye schulen seie to this more tre , Be thou drawun vp bi the rote , and be ouerplauntid in to the see , and it schal obeie to you .
42017007	But who of you hath a seruaunt erynge , or lesewynge oxis , which seith to hym , whanne he turneth ayen fro the feeld , Anoon go , and sitte to mete ;
42017008	and seith not to hym , Make redi , that Y soupe , and girde thee , and serue me , while Y ete and drynke , and aftir this thou schalt ete and drynke ;
42017009	whether he hath grace to that seruaunt , for he dide that that he comaundide hym ?
42017010	Nay , Y gesse . So ye , whanne ye han don alle thingis that ben comaundid to you , seie ye , We ben vnprofitable seruauntis , we han do that that we ouyten to do .
42017011	And it was do , the while Jhesus wente in to Jerusalem , he passide thorou the myddis of Samarie , and Galilee .
42017012	And whanne he entride in to a castel , ten leprouse men camen ayens hym , whiche stoden afer ,
42017013	and reiseden her voys , and seiden , Jhesu , comaundoure , haue merci on vs .
42017014	And as he say hem , he seide , Go ye , ` schewe ye you to the prestis . And it was don , the while thei wenten , thei weren clensid .
42017015	And oon of hem , as he saiy that he was clensid , wente ayen , magnifiynge God with grete vois .
42017016	And he fel doun on the face bifore hise feet , and dide thankyngis ; and this was a Samaritan .
42017017	And Jhesus answerde , and seide , Whether ten ben not clensid , and where ben the nyne ?
42017018	There is noon foundun , that turnede ayen , and yaf glorie to God , but this alien .
42017019	And he seide to hym , Rise vp , go thou ; for thi feith hath maad thee saaf .
42017020	And he was axid of Farisees , whanne the rewme of God cometh . And he answerde to hem , and seide , The rewme of God cometh not with aspiyng ,
42017021	nether thei schulen seie , Lo ! here , or lo there ; for lo ! the rewme of God is with ynne you .
42017022	And he seide to hise disciplis , Daies schulen come , whanne ye schulen desire to se o dai of mannus sone , and ye schulen not se .
42017023	And thei schulen seie to you , Lo ! here , and lo there . Nyle ye go , nether sue ye ;
42017024	for as leyt schynynge from vndur heuene schyneth in to tho thingis that ben vndur heuene , so schal mannus sone be in his dai .
42017025	But first it bihoueth hym to suffre many thingis , and to be repreued of this generacioun .
42017026	And as it was doon in the daies of Noe , so it schal be in the daies of mannys sone .
42017027	Thei eeten and drunkun , weddiden wyues , and weren youun to weddyngis , til in to the dai in the whych Noe entride in to the schip ; and the greet flood cam , and loste alle .
42017028	Also as it was don in the daies of Loth , thei eeten and drunkun , bouyten and seelden , plauntiden and bildiden ; but the dai that Loth wente out of Sodome ,
42017029	the Lord reynede fier and brymstoon fro heuene , and loste alle .
42017030	Lijk this thing it schal be , in what dai mannys sone schal be schewid .
42017031	In that our he that is in the roof , and his vessels in the hous , come he not doun to take hem awei ; and he that schal be in the feeld , also turne not ayen bihynde .
42017032	Be ye myndeful of the wijf of Loth .
42017033	Who euer seketh to make his lijf saaf , schal leese it ; and who euer leesith it , schal quykene it .
42017034	But Y seie to you , in that nyyt twei schulen be in o bed , oon schal be takun , and the tothir forsakun ;
42017035	twei wymmen schulen be gryndynge togidir , ` the toon schal be takun , and ` the tother forsakun ; twei in a feeld , ` the toon schal be takun , and ` the tother left .
42017036	Thei answeren , and seien to hym , Where , Lord ?
42017037	Which seide to hym , Where euer the bodi schal be , thidur schulen be gaderid togidere also the eglis .
42018001	And he seide to hem also a parable , that it bihoueth to preye euer more , and not faile ;
42018002	and seide , There was a iuge in a citee , that dredde not God , nether schamede of men .
42018003	And a widowe was in that citee , and sche cam to hym , and seide , Venge me of myn aduersarie ;
42018004	and he wolde not longe tyme . But aftir these thingis he seide with ynne hym silf , Thouy Y drede not God , and schame not of man ,
42018005	netheles for this widewe is heuy to me , Y schal venge hir ; lest at the laste sche comynge condempne me .
42018006	And the Lord seide , Here ye , what the domesman of wickidnesse seith ;
42018007	and whether God schal not do veniaunce of hise chosun , criynge to hym dai and nyyt , and schal haue pacience in hem ?
42018008	Sotheli Y seie to you , for soone he schal do veniaunce of hem . Netheles gessist thou , that mannus sone comynge schal fynde feith in erthe ?
42018009	And he seide also to sum men , that tristiden in hem silf , as thei weren riytful , and dispiseden othere , this parable ,
42018010	seiynge , Twei men wenten vp in to the temple to preye ; the toon a Farisee , and the tother a pupplican .
42018011	And the Farisee stood , and preiede bi hym silf these thingis , and seide , God , Y do thankyngis to thee , for Y am not as other men , raueinouris , vniust , auoutreris , as also this pupplican ;
42018012	Y faste twies in the woke , Y yyue tithis of alle thingis that Y haue in possessioun .
42018013	And the pupplican stood afer , and wolde nether reise hise iyen to heuene , but smoot his brest , and seide , God be merciful to me , synnere .
42018014	Treuli Y seie to you , this yede doun in to his hous , and was iustified fro the other . For ech that enhaunsith hym , schal be maad low , and he that mekith hym , schal be enhaunsid .
42018015	And thei brouyten to hym yonge children , that he schulde touche hem ; and whanne the disciplis saien this thing , thei blameden hem .
42018016	But Jhesus clepide togider hem , and seide , Suffre ye children to come to me , and nyle ye forbede hem , for of siche is the kyngdom of heuenes .
42018017	Treuli Y seie to you , who euer schal not take the kyngdom of God as a child , he schal not entre in to it .
42018018	And a prince axide hym , and seide , Goode maister , in what thing doynge schal Y weilde euerlastynge lijf ?
42018019	And Jhesus seide to hym , What seist thou me good ? No man is good , but God aloone .
42018020	Thou knowist the comaundementis , Thou schalt not sle , Thou schalt not do letcherie , Thou schalt not do theft , Thou schalt not seie fals witnessyng , Worschipe thi fadir and thi modir .
42018021	Which seide , Y haue kept alle these thingis fro my yongthe .
42018022	And whanne this thing was herd , Jhesus seide to hym , Yit o thing failith ` to thee ; sille thou alle thingis that thou hast , and yyue to pore men , and thou schalt haue tresour in heuene ; and come , and sue thou me .
42018023	Whanne these thingis weren herd , he was soreful , for he was ful ryche .
42018024	And Jhesus seynge hym maad sorie , seide , How hard thei that han money schulen entre in to the kyngdom of God ;
42018025	for it is liyter a camel to passe thorou a nedlis iye , than a riche man to entre in to the kyngdom of God .
42018026	And thei that herden these thingis seiden , Who may be maad saaf ?
42018027	And he seide to hem , Tho thingis that ben impossible anentis men , ben possible anentis God .
42018028	But Petir seide , Lo ! we han left alle thingis , and han sued thee .
42018029	And he seide to hym , Treuli Y seie to you , there is no man that schal forsake hous , or fadir , modir , or britheren , or wijf , or children , or feeldis , for the rewme of God ,
42018030	and schal not resseyue many mo thingis in this tyme , and in the world to comynge euerlastynge lijf .
42018031	And Jhesus took hise twelue disciplis , and seide to hem , Lo ! we gon vp to Jerusalem , and alle thingis schulen be endid , that ben writun bi the prophetis of mannus sone .
42018032	For he schal be bitraied to hethen men , and he schal be scorned , and scourgid , and bispat ;
42018033	and aftir that thei han scourgid , thei schulen sle hym , and the thridde dai he schal rise ayen .
42018034	And thei vndurstoden no thing of these ; and this word was hid fro hem , and thei vndurstoden not tho thingis that weren seid .
42018035	But it was don , whanne Jhesus cam nyy to Jerico , a blynde man sat bisidis the weie , and beggide .
42018036	And whanne he herde the puple passynge , he axide , what this was .
42018037	And thei seiden to hym , that Jhesus of Nazareth passide .
42018038	And he criede , and seide , Jhesu , the sone of Dauyd , haue mercy on me .
42018039	And thei that wenten bifor blamyden hym , that he schulde be stille ; but he criede myche the more , Thou sone of Dauid , haue mercy on me .
42018040	And Jhesus stood , and comaundide hym to be brouyt forth to hym . And whanne he cam nyy , he axide hym ,
42018041	and seide , What wolt thou that Y schal do to thee ? And he seide , Lord , that Y se .
42018042	And Jhesus seide to hym , Biholde ; thi feith hath maad thee saaf .
42018043	And anoon he say , and suede hym , and magnyfiede God . And al the puple , as it say , yaf heriyng to God .
42019001	And Jhesus ` goynge yn , walkide thorou Jericho .
42019002	And lo ! a man , Sache bi name , and this was a prince of pupplicans , and he was riche .
42019003	And he souyte to se Jhesu , who he was , and he myyte not , for the puple , for he was litil in stature .
42019004	And he ran bifore , and stiyede in to a sicomoure tree , to se hym ; for he was to passe fro thennus .
42019005	And Jhesus biheld vp , whanne he cam to the place , and saiy hym , and seide to hym , Sache , haste thee , and come doun , for to dai Y mot dwelle in thin hous .
42019006	And he hiyynge cam doun , and ioiynge resseyuede hym .
42019007	And whanne alle men sayn , thei grutchiden seiynge , For he hadde turned to a synful man .
42019008	But Sache stood , and seide to the Lord , Lo ! Lord , Y yyue the half of my good to pore men ; and if Y haue ony thing defraudid ony man , Y yelde foure so myche .
42019009	Jhesus seith to hym , For to dai heelthe is maad to this hous , for that he is Abrahams sone ;
42019010	for mannus sone cam to seke , and make saaf that thing that perischide .
42019011	Whanne thei herden these thingis , he addide , and seide a parable , for that he was nyy Jerusalem , ` and for thei gessiden , that anoon the kyngdom of God schulde be schewid .
42019012	Therfor he seide , A worthi man wente in to a fer cuntre , to take to hym a kyngdom , and to turne ayen .
42019013	And whanne hise ten seruauntis weren clepid , he yaf to hem ten besauntis ; and seide to hem , Chaffare ye , til Y come .
42019014	But hise citeseyns hatiden hym , and senten a messanger aftir hym , and seiden , We wolen not , that he regne on vs .
42019015	And it was don , that he turnede ayen , whan he hadde take the kyngdom ; and he comaundide hise seruauntis to be clepid , to whiche he hadde yyue monei , to wite , hou myche ech hadde wonne bi chaffaryng .
42019016	And the firste cam , and seide , Lord , thi besaunt hath wonne ten besauntis .
42019017	He seide to hym , Wel be , thou good seruaunt ; for in litil thing thou hast be trewe , thou schalt be hauynge power on ten citees .
42019018	And the tother cam , and seide , Lord , thi besaunt hath maad fyue besauntis .
42019019	And to this he seide , And be thou on fyue citees .
42019020	And the thridde cam , and seide , Lord , lo ! thi besaunt , that Y hadde , put vp in a sudarie .
42019021	For Y dredde thee , for thou art ` a sterne man ; thou takist awey that that thou settidist not , and thou repist that that thou hast not sowun .
42019022	He seith to hym , Wickid seruaunt , of thi mouth Y deme thee . Wistist thou , that Y am ` a sterne man , takynge awei that thing that Y settide not , and repyng ethat thing that Y sewe not ?
42019023	and whi hast thou not youun my money to the bord , and Y comynge schulde haue axid it with vsuris ?
42019024	And he seide to men stondynge nyy , Take ye awei fro hym the besaunt , and yyue ye to hym that hath ten beyauntis :
42019025	And thei seiden to hym , Lord , he hath ten besauntis .
42019026	And Y seie to you , to ech man that hath , it schal be youun , and he schal encreese ; but fro him that hath not , also that thing that he hath , schal be takun of hym .
42019027	Netheles brynge ye hidur tho myn enemyes , that wolden not that Y regnede on hem , and sle ye bifor me .
42019028	And whanne these thingis weren seid , he wente bifore , and yede vp to Jerusalem .
42019029	And it was don , whanne Jhesus cam nyy to Bethfage and Betanye , at the mount , that is clepid of Olyuete , he sente hise twei disciplis , and seide ,
42019030	Go ye in to the castel , that is ayens you ; in to which as ye entren , ye schulen fynde a colt of an asse tied , on which neuer man sat ; vntye ye hym , and brynge ye to me .
42019031	And if ony man axe you , whi ye vntien , thus ye schulen seie to hym , For the Lord desirith his werk .
42019032	And thei that weren sent , wenten forth , and fonden as he seide to hem , a colt stondynge .
42019033	And whanne thei vntieden the colt , the lordis of hym seiden to hem , What vntien ye the colt ?
42019034	And thei seiden , For the Lord hath nede to hym .
42019035	And thei ledden hym to Jhesu ; and thei castynge her clothis on the colt , setten Jhesu on hym .
42019036	And whanne he wente , thei strowiden her clothis in the weie .
42019037	And whanne he cam nyy to the comyng doun of the mount of Olyuete , al the puple that cam doun bygunnen to ioye , and to herie God with greet vois on alle the vertues , that thei hadden sayn ,
42019038	and seiden , Blessid be the king , that cometh in the name of the Lord ; pees in heuene , and glorie in hiye thingis .
42019039	And sum of the Farisees of the puple seiden to hym , Maister , blame thi disciplis .
42019040	And he seide to hem , Y seie to you , for if these ben stille , stoonus schulen crye .
42019041	And whanne he neiyede , ` he seiy the citee ,
42019042	and wepte on it , and seide , For if thou haddist knowun , thou schuldist wepe also ; for in this dai the thingis ben in pees to thee , but now thei ben hid fro thin iyen .
42019043	But daies schulen come in thee , and thin enemyes schulen enuyroun thee with a pale , and thei schulen go aboute thee , and make thee streit on alle sidis ,
42019044	and caste thee doun to the erthe , and thi sones that ben in thee ; and thei schulen not leeue in thee a stoon on a stoon , for thou hast not knowun the tyme of thi visitacioun .
42019045	And he entride in to the temple , and bigan to caste out men sellynge ther inne and biynge ,
42019046	and seide to hem , It is writun , That myn hous is an hous of preyer , but ye han maad it a den of theues .
42019047	And he was techynge euerydai in the temple . And the princis of prestis , and the scribis , and the princis of the puple souyten to lese hym ;
42019048	and thei founden not , what thei schulden do to hym , for al the puple was ocupied , and herde hym .
42020001	And it was don in oon of the daies , whanne he tauyte the puple in the temple , and prechide the gospel , the princis of preestis and scribis camen togidere with the elder men ;
42020002	and thei seiden to hym , Seie to vs , in what power thou doist these thingis , or who is he that yaf to thee this power ?
42020003	And Jhesus answeride , and seide to hem , And Y schal axe you o word ; answere ye to me .
42020004	Was the baptym of Joon of heuene , or of men ?
42020005	And thei thouyten with ynne hem silf , seiynge , For if we seien , Of heuene , he schal seie , Whi thanne bileuen ye not to hym ?
42020006	and if we seien , Of men , al the puple schal stoone vs ; for thei ben certeyn , that Joon is a prophete .
42020007	And thei answeriden , that thei knewen not , of whennus it was .
42020008	And Jhesus seide to hem , Nether Y seie to you , in what power Y do these thingis .
42020009	And he bigan to seie to the puple this parable . A man plauntide a vynyerd , and hiride it to tilieris ; and he was in pilgrimage longe tyme .
42020010	And in the tyme of gaderynge of grapis , he sente a seruaunt to the tilieris , that thei schulden yyue to hym of the fruyt of the vynyerd ; whiche beten hym , and leten hym go voide .
42020011	And he thouyte yit to sende another seruaunt ; and thei beten this , and turmentiden hym sore , and leten hym go .
42020012	And he thouyte yit to sende the thridde , and hym also thei woundiden , and castiden out .
42020013	And the lord of the vyneyerd seide , What schal Y do ? Y schal sende my dereworthe sone ; perauenture , whanne thei seen hym , thei schulen drede .
42020014	And whanne the tilieris sayn hym , thei thouyten with ynne hem silf , and seiden , This is the eire , sle we hym , that the eritage be oure .
42020015	And thei castiden hym out of the vyneyerd , and killiden hym . What schal thanne the lord of the vyneyerd do to hem ?
42020016	He schal come , and distruye these tilieris , and yyue the vyneyerd to othere . And whanne this thing was herd , thei seiden to hym , God forbede .
42020017	But he bihelde hem , and seide , What thanne is this that is writun , The stoon which men bildynge repreueden , this is maad in to the heed of the corner ?
42020018	Ech that schal falle on that stoon , schal be to-brisid , but on whom it schal falle , it schal al to-breke him .
42020019	And the princis of prestis , and scribis , souyten to leye on hym hoondis in that our , and thei dredden the puple ; for thei knewen that to hem he seide this liknesse .
42020020	And thei aspieden , and senten aspieris , that feyneden hem iust , that thei schulden take hym in word , and bitaak hym to the ` power of the prince , and to the power of the iustice .
42020021	And thei axiden hym , and seiden , Maister , we witen , that riytli thou seist and techist ; and thou takist not the persoone of man , but thou techist in treuthe the weie of God .
42020022	Is it leueful to vs to yyue tribute to the emperoure , or nay ?
42020023	And he biheld the disseit of hem , and seide to hem , What tempten ye me ?
42020024	Shewe ye to me a peny ; whos ymage and superscripcioun hath it ? Thei answerden , and seiden to hym , The emperouris .
42020025	And he seide to hem , Yelde ye therfor to the emperoure tho thingis that ben the emperours , and tho thingis that ben of God , to God .
42020026	And thei myyten not repreue his word bifor the puple ; and thei wondriden in his answere , and heelden pees .
42020027	Summe of the Saduceis , that denyeden the ayenrisyng fro deeth to lijf , camen , and axiden hym ,
42020028	and seiden , Maister , Moises wroot to vs , if the brother of ony man haue a wijf , and be deed , and he was with outen eiris , that his brothir take his wijf , and reise seed to his brother .
42020029	And so there weren seuene britheren . The firste took a wijf , and is deed with outen eiris ;
42020030	and the brothir suynge took hir , and he is deed with outen sone ;
42020031	and the thridde took hir ; also and alle seuene , and leften not seed , but ben deed ;
42020032	and the laste of alle the womman is deed .
42020033	Therfor in the ` risyng ayen , whos wijf of hem schal sche be ? for seuene hadden hir to wijf .
42020034	And Jhesus seide to hem , Sones of this world wedden , and ben youun to weddyngis ;
42020035	but thei that schulen be had worthi of that world , and of the ` risyng ayen fro deeth , nethir ben wedded ,
42020036	nethir wedden wyues , nethir schulen mowe die more ; for thei ben euen with aungels , and ben the sones of God , sithen thei ben the sones of ` risyng ayen fro deeth .
42020037	And that deed men risen ayen , also Moises schewide bisidis the busch , as he seith , The Lord God of Abraham , and God of Ysaac , and God of Jacob .
42020038	And God is not of deed men , but of lyuynge men ; for alle men lyuen to hym .
42020039	And summe of scribis answeringe , seiden , Maistir , thou hast wel seid .
42020040	And thei dursten no more axe hym ony thing .
42020041	But he seide to hem , How seien men , Crist to be the sone of Dauid ,
42020042	and Dauid hym silf seith in the book of Salmes , The Lord seide to my lord , Sitte thou on my riythalf ,
42020043	til that Y putte thin enemyes a stool of thi feet ?
42020044	Therfor Dauid clepith hym lord , and hou is he his sone ?
42020045	And in heryng of al the puple , he seide to hise disciplis ,
42020046	Be ye war of scribis , that wolen wandre in stolis , and louen salutaciouns in chepyng , and the firste chaieris in synagogis , and the firste sittynge placis in feestis ;
42020047	that deuouren the housis of widewis , and feynen long preiyng ; these schulen take the more dampnacioun .
42021001	And he biheeld , and saye tho riche men , that casten her yiftis in to the treserie ;
42021002	but he saye also a litil pore widewe castynge twei ferthingis .
42021003	And he seide , Treuli Y seie to you , that this pore widewe keste more than alle men .
42021004	For whi alle these of thing that was plenteuouse to hem casten in to the yiftis of God ; but this widewe of that thing that failide to hir , caste al hir liflode , that sche hadde .
42021005	And whanne sum men seiden of the temple , that it was apparailid with gode stoonus and yiftis ,
42021006	he seide , These thingis that ye seen , daies schulen come , in whiche a stoon schal not be left on a stoon , which schal not be destried .
42021007	And thei axiden hym , and seiden , Comaundour , whanne schulen these thingis be ? and what tokne schal be , whanne thei schulen bigynne to be don ?
42021008	And he seide , Se ye , that ye be not disseyued ; for many schulen come in my name , seiynge , For Y am , and the tyme schal neiye ; therfor nyle ye go aftir hem .
42021009	And whanne ye schulen here batailis and stryues with ynne , nyle ye be aferd ; it bihoueth first these thingis to be don , but not yit anoon is an ende .
42021010	Thanne he seide to hem , Folk schal rise ayens folk , and rewme ayens rewme ;
42021011	grete mouyngis of erthe schulen be bi placis , and pestilencis , and hungris , and dredis fro heuene , and grete tokenes schulen be .
42021012	But bifore alle these thingis thei schulen sette her hoondis on you , and schulen pursue , bitakynge in to synagogis and kepyngis , drawynge to kyngis and to iusticis , for my name ;
42021013	but it schal falle to you in to witnessyng .
42021014	Therfor putte ye in youre hertis , not to thenke bifore , hou ye schulen answere ; for Y schal yyue to you mouth and wisdom ,
42021015	to whiche alle youre aduersaries schulen not mowe ayenstonde , and ayenseie .
42021016	And ye schulen be takun of fadir , and modir , and britheren , and cosyns , and freendis , and bi deeth thei schulen turmente of you ;
42021017	and ye schulen be in haate to alle men for my name .
42021018	And an heere of youre heed schal not perische ;
42021019	in youre pacience ye schulen welde youre soulis .
42021020	But whanne ye schulen se Jerusalem ben enuyround with an oost , thanne wite ye , that the desolacioun of it schal neiye .
42021021	Thanne thei that ben in Judee , fle to the mountans ; and thei that ben in the mydil of it , gon awei ; and thei that ben in the cuntreis , entre not in to it .
42021022	For these ben daies of veniaunce , that alle thingis that ben writun , be fulfillid .
42021023	And wo to hem , that ben with child , and norischen in tho daies ; for a greet diseese schal be on the erthe , and wraththe to this puple .
42021024	And thei schulen falle bi the scharpnesse of swerd , and thei schulen be led prisoneris in to alle folkis ; and Jerusalem schal be defoulid of hethene men , til the tymes of naciouns be fulfillid .
42021025	And tokenes schulen be in the sunne , and the mone , and in the sterris ; and in the erthe ouerleiyng of folkis , for confusioun of sown of the see and of floodis ;
42021026	for men schulen wexe drye for drede and abidyng that schulen come to al the world ; for vertues of heuenes schulen be mouyd .
42021027	And thanne thei schulen se mannys sone comynge in a cloude , with greet power and maieste .
42021028	And whanne these thingis bigynnen to be maad , biholde ye , and reise ye youre heedis , for youre redempcioun neiyeth .
42021029	And he seide to hem a liknesse , Se ye the fige tre , and alle trees ,
42021030	whanne thei bryngen forth now of hem silf fruyt , ye witen that somer is nyy ;
42021031	so ye , whanne ye seen these thingis to be don , wite ye , that the kyngdom of God is nyy .
42021032	Treuli Y seie to you , that this generacioun schal not passe , til alle thingis be don .
42021033	Heuene and erthe schulen passe , but my wordis schulen not passe .
42021034	But take ye heede to you silf , lest perauenture youre hertis be greuyd with glotony , and drunkenesse , and bisynessis of this lijf , and thilke dai come sodein on you ; for as a snare it schal come on alle men ,
42021035	that sitten on the face of al erthe .
42021036	Therfor wake ye , preiynge in ech tyme , that ye be hadde worthi to fle alle these thingis that ben to come , and to stonde bifor mannus sone .
42021037	And in daies he was techynge in the temple , but in nyytis he yede out , and dwellide in the mount , that is clepid of Olyuet .
42021038	And al the puple roos eerli , to come to hym in the temple , and to here hym .
42022001	And the halidai of therf looues , that is seid pask , neiyede .
42022002	And the princis of preestis and the scribis souyten , hou thei schulden sle Jhesu , but thei dredden the puple .
42022003	And Sathanas entride in to Judas , that was clepid Scarioth , oon of the twelue .
42022004	And he wente , and spak with the princis of preestis , and with the magistratis , hou he schulde bitray hym to hem .
42022005	And thei ioyeden , and maden couenaunt to yyue hym money .
42022006	And he bihiyte , and he souyte oportunyte , to bitraye hym , with outen puple .
42022007	But the daies of therf looues camen , in whiche it was neede , that the sacrifice of pask were slayn .
42022008	And he sente Petre and Joon , and seide , Go ye , and make ye redi to vs the pask , that we ete .
42022009	And thei seiden , Where wolt thou , that we make redi ?
42022010	And he seide to hem , Lo ! whanne ye schulen entre in to the citee , a man berynge a vessel of watir schal meete you ; sue ye hym in to the hous , in to which he entrith .
42022011	And ye schulen seie to the hosebonde man of the hous , The maister seith to thee , Where is a chaumbre , where Y schal ete the pask with my disciplis ?
42022012	And he schal schewe to you a greet soupyng place strewid , and there make ye redi .
42022013	And thei yeden , and founden as he seide to hem , and thei maden redi the pask .
42022014	And whanne the our was come , he sat to the mete , and the twelue apostlis with hym .
42022015	And he seide to hem , With desier Y haue desirid to ete with you this pask , bifor that Y suffre ;
42022016	for Y seie to you , that fro this tyme Y schal not ete it , til it be fulfillid in the rewme of God .
42022017	And whanne he hadde take the cuppe , he dide gracis , and seide , Take ye , and departe ye among you ;
42022018	for Y seie to you , that Y schal not drynke of the kynde of this vyne , til the rewme of God come .
42022019	And whanne he hadde take breed , he dide thankyngis , and brak , and yaf to hem , and seide , This is my bodi , that schal be youun for you ; do ye this thing in mynde of me .
42022020	He took also the cuppe , aftir that he hadde soupid , and seide , This cuppe is the newe testament in my blood , that schal be sched for you .
42022021	Netheles lo ! the hoond of hym that bitraieth me , is with me at the table .
42022022	And mannus sone goith , ` aftir that it is determyned ; netheles wo to that man , bi whom he schal be bitraied .
42022023	And thei bigunnen to seke among hem , who it was of hem , that was to do this thing .
42022024	And strijf was maad among hem , which of hem schulde be seyn to be grettest .
42022025	But he seide to hem , Kyngis of hethen men ben lordis of hem , and thei that han power on hem ben clepid good doeris , but ye not so ;
42022026	but he that is grettest among you , be maad as yongere , and he that is bifor goere , as a seruaunt .
42022027	For who is gretter , he that sittith at the mete , or he that mynystrith ? whether not he that sittith at the mete ? And Y am in the myddil of you , as he that mynystrith .
42022028	And ye ben , that han dwellid with me in my temptaciouns ; and Y dispose to you ,
42022029	as my fadir hath disposid to me ,
42022030	a rewme , that ye ete and drynke on my boord in my rewme , and sitte on trones , and deme the twelue kynredis of Israel .
42022031	And the Lord seide to Symount , Symount , lo , Satanas hath axid you , that he schulde ridile as whete ; but Y haue preyede for thee ,
42022032	that thi feith faile not ; and thou sum tyme conuertid , conferme thi britheren .
42022033	Which seide to hym , Lord , Y am redi to go in to prisoun and in to deeth with thee .
42022034	And he seide , Y seie to thee , Petir , the cok schal not crowe to dai , til thou thries forsake that thou knowist me .
42022035	And he seide to hem , Whanne Y sente you with outen sachel , and scrippe , and schone , whether ony thing failide to you ?
42022036	And thei seiden , No thing . Therfor he seide to hem , But now he that hath a sachel , take also and a scrippe ; and he that hath noon , selle his coote , and bigge a swerd .
42022037	For Y seie to you , that yit it bihoueth that thing that is writun to be fulfillid in me , And he is arettid with wickid men ; for tho thingis that ben of me han ende .
42022038	And thei seiden , Lord , lo ! twei swerdis here . And he seide to hem , It is ynowy .
42022039	And he yede out , and wente aftir the custom in to the hille of Olyues ; and the disciplis sueden hym .
42022040	And whanne he cam to the place , he seide to hem , Preye ye , lest ye entren in to temptacioun .
42022041	And he was taken awei fro hem , so myche as is a stonys cast ; and he knelide ,
42022042	and preyede , and seide , Fadir , if thou wolt , do awei this cuppe fro me ; netheles not my wille be don , but thin .
42022043	And an aungel apperide to hym fro heuene , and coumfortide hym . And he was maad in agonye , and preyede the lenger ;
42022044	and his swot was maad as dropis of blood rennynge doun in to the erthe .
42022045	And whanne he was rysun fro preier , and was comun to hise disciplis , he foond hem slepynge for heuynesse .
42022046	And he seide to hem , What slepen ye ? Rise ye , and preye ye , that ye entre not in to temptacioun .
42022047	Yit while he spak , lo ! a company , and he that was clepid Judas , oon of the twelue , wente bifor hem ; and he cam to Jhesu , to kisse hym .
42022048	And Jhesus seide to hym , Judas , ` with a coss ` thou bytrayest ` mannys sone .
42022049	And thei that weren aboute hym , and sayn that that was to come , seiden to hym , Lord , whether we smyten with swerd ?
42022050	And oon of hem smoot the seruaunt of the prince of preestis , and kittide of his riyt eere .
42022051	But Jhesus answerde , and seide , Suffre ye til hidir . And whanne he hadde touchid his eere , he heelide hym .
42022052	And Jhesus seide to hem , that camen to hym , the princis of preestis , and maiestratis of the temple , and eldre men , As to a theef ye han gon out with swerdis and staues ?
42022053	Whanne Y was ech dai with you in the temple , ye streiyten not out hondis in to me ; but this is youre our , and the power of derknessis .
42022054	And thei token him , and ledden to the hous of the prince of prestis ; and Petir suede hym afer .
42022055	And whanne a fier was kyndelid in the myddil of the greet hous , and thei saten aboute , Petir was in the myddil of hem .
42022056	Whom whanne a damysel hadde seyn sittynge ` at the liyt , and hadde biholdun hym , sche seide , And this was with hym .
42022057	And he denyede hym , and seide , Womman , Y knowe hym not .
42022058	And aftir a litil another man siy hym , and seide , And thou art of hem . But Petir seide , A ! man , Y am not .
42022059	And whanne a space was maad as of on our , another affermyd , and seide , Treuli this was with hym ; for also he is of Galilee .
42022060	And Petir seide , Man , Y noot what thou seist . And anoon yit while he spak , the cok crewe .
42022061	And the Lord turnede ayen , and bihelde Petre ; and Petre hadde mynde on the word of Jhesu , as he hadde seid , For bifor that the cok crowe , thries thou schalt denye me .
42022062	And Petre yede out , and wepte bittirli .
42022063	And the men that helden hym scorneden hym , and smyten hym .
42022064	And thei blynfelden hym , and smyten his face , and axiden hym , and seiden , Arede , thou Crist , to vs , who is he that smoot thee ?
42022065	Also thei blasfemynge seiden ayens hym many other thingis .
42022066	And as the day was come , the eldre men of the puple , and the princis of prestis , and the scribis camen togidir , and ledden hym in to her councel ,
42022067	and seiden , If thou art Crist , seie to vs .
42022068	And he seide to hem , If Y seie to you , ye schulen not bileue to me ; and if Y axe , ye schulen not answere to me , nethir ye schulen delyuere me .
42022069	But aftir this tyme mannys sone schal be sittynge on the riyt half of the vertu of God .
42022070	Therfor alle seiden , Thanne art thou the sone of God ? And he seide , Ye seien that Y am .
42022071	And thei seiden , What yit desiren we witnessyng ? for we vs silf han herd of his mouth .
42023001	And al the multitude of hem arysen , and ledden hym to Pilat .
42023002	And thei bigunnen to accuse hym , and seiden , We han foundun this turnynge vpsodoun oure folk , and forbedynge tributis to be youun to the emperour , and seiynge that hym silf is Crist and kyng .
42023003	And Pilat axide hym , and seide , Art thou kyng of Jewis ? And he answeride , and seide , Thou seist .
42023004	And Pilat seide to the princis of prestis , and to the puple , Y fynde no thing of cause in this man .
42023005	And thei woxen stronger , and seiden , He moueth the puple , techynge thorou al Judee , bigynnynge fro Galile til hidir .
42023006	And Pilat herynge Galile axide , if he were a man of Galile .
42023007	And whanne he knewe that he was of the powere of Eroude , he sente hym to Eroude ; which was at Jerusalem in tho daies .
42023008	And whanne Eroude siy Jhesu , he ioyede ful myche ; for long tyme he coueitide to se hym , for he herde many thingis of hym , and hopide to see sum tokene ` to be don of hym .
42023009	And he axide hym in many wordis ; and he answeride no thing to hym .
42023010	And the princis of preestis and the scribis stoden , stidfastli accusynge hym .
42023011	But Eroude with his oost dispiside hym , and scornede hym , and clothide with a white cloth , and sente hym ayen to Pilat .
42023012	And Eroude and Pilat weren maad freendis fro that dai ; for bifor thei weren enemyes togidre .
42023013	And Pilat clepide togider the princis of prestis and the maiestratis of the puple , and seide to hem ,
42023014	Ye han brouyt to me this man , as turnynge awey the puple , and lo ! Y axynge bifor you fynde no cause in this man of these thingis , in whiche ye accusen hym ;
42023015	nether Eroude , for he hath sent hym ayen to vs , and lo ! no thing worthi of deth is don to hym .
42023016	And therfor Y schal amende hym , and delyuere hym .
42023017	But he moste nede delyuer to hem oon bi the feest dai .
42023018	And al the puple criede togidir , and seide , Do ` awei hym , and delyuer to vs Barabas ;
42023019	which was sent ` in to prisoun for disturblyng maad in the cite , and for mansleynge .
42023020	And eftsoone Pilat spak to hem , and wolde delyuer Jhesu .
42023021	And thei vndurcrieden , and seiden , Crucifie , crucifie hym .
42023022	And the thridde tyme he seide to hem , For what yuel hath this don ? Y fynde no cause of deeth in hym ; therfor Y schal chastise hym , and Y schal delyuer .
42023023	And thei contynueden with greet voicis axynge , that he schulde be crucified ; and the voicis of hem woxen stronge .
42023024	And Pilat demyde her axyng to be don .
42023025	And he delyueride to hem hym , that for mansleyng and sedicioun was sent in to prisoun , whom thei axiden ; but he bitook Jhesu to her wille .
42023026	And whanne thei ledden hym , thei token a man , Symon of Syrenen , comynge fro the toun , and thei leiden on hym the cross to bere aftir Jhesu .
42023027	And there suede hym myche puple , and wymmen that weiliden , and bymorneden hym .
42023028	And Jhesus turnede to hem , and seide , Douytris of Jerusalem , nyle ye wepe on me , but wepe ye on youre silf and on youre sones .
42023029	For lo ! daies schulen come , in whiche it schal be seid , Blessid be bareyn wymmen , and wombis that han not borun children , and the tetis that han not youun souke .
42023030	Thanne thei schulen bigynne to seie to mounteyns , Falle ye doun on vs , and to smale hillis , Keuere ye vs .
42023031	For if in a greene tre thei don these thingis , what schal be don in a drie ?
42023032	Also othere twei wickid men weren led with hym , to be slayn .
42023033	And ` aftir that thei camen in to a place , that is clepid of Caluerie , there thei crucifieden hym , and the theues , oon on the riyt half , and ` the tother on the left half .
42023034	But Jhesus seide , Fadir , foryyue hem , for thei witen not what thei doon .
42023035	And thei departiden his clothis , and kesten lottis . And the puple stood abidynge ; and the princis scorneden hym with hem , and seiden , Othere men he maad saaf ; make he hym silf saaf , if this be Crist , the chosun of God .
42023036	And the knyytis neiyeden , and scorneden hym , and profreden vynegre to hym ,
42023037	and seiden , If thou art king of Jewis , make thee saaf .
42023038	And the superscripcioun was writun ouer hym with Greke lettris , and of Latyn , and of Ebreu , This is the kyng of Jewis .
42023039	And oon of these theues that hangiden , blasfemyde hym , and seide , If thou art Crist , make thi silf saaf and vs .
42023040	But ` the tothir answerynge , blamyde hym , and seide , Nether thou dredist God , that art in the same dampnacioun ?
42023041	And treuli we iustli , for we han resseiued worthi thingis to werkis ; but this dide no thing of yuel .
42023042	And he seide to Jhesu , Lord , haue mynde of me , whanne thou comest ` in to thi kyngdom .
42023043	And Jhesus seide to hym , Treuli Y seie to thee , this dai thou schalt be with me in paradise .
42023044	And it was almest the sixte our , and derknessis weren maad in al the erthe ` in to the nynthe our .
42023045	And the sun was maad derk , and the veile of the temple was to-rent atwo .
42023046	And Jhesus criynge with a greet vois , seide , Fadir , in to thin hoondis Y bitake my spirit . And he seiynge these thingis , yaf vp the goost .
42023047	And the centurien seynge that thing that was don , glorifiede God , and seide , Verili this man was iust .
42023048	And al the puple of hem that weren there togidir at this spectacle , and sayn tho thingis that weren don , smyten her brestis , and turneden ayen .
42023049	But alle his knowun stoden afer , and wymmen that sueden hym fro Galile , seynge these thingis .
42023050	And lo ! a man , Joseph bi name , of Aramathie , a cite of Judee , that was a decurien , a good man and a iust ,
42023051	this man concentide not to the counseil and to the dedis of hem ; and he abood the kyngdom of God .
42023052	This Joseph cam to Pilat , and axide the bodi of Jhesu ,
42023053	and took it doun , and wlappide it in a cleene lynen cloth , and leide hym in a graue hewun , in which not yit ony man hadde be leid .
42023054	And the dai was the euen of the halidai , and the sabat bigan to schyne .
42023055	And the wymmen suynge , that camen with hym fro Galile , sayn the graue , and hou his bodi was leid .
42023056	And thei turneden ayen , and maden redi swete smellynge spicis , and oynementis ; but in the sabat thei restiden , aftir the comaundement .
42024001	But in o dai of the woke ful eerli thei camen to the graue , and brouyten swete smellynge spices , that thei hadden arayed .
42024002	And thei founden the stoon turned awei fro the graue .
42024003	And thei yeden in , and founden not the bodi of the Lord Jhesu .
42024004	And it was don , the while thei weren astonyed in thouyt of this thing , lo ! twei men stoden bisidis hem in schynynge cloth .
42024005	And whanne thei dredden , and boweden her semblaunt in to the erthe , thei seiden to hem , What seken ye hym that lyueth with deed men ?
42024006	He is not here , but is risun . Haue ye mynde , hou he spak to you , whanne he was yit in Galile ,
42024007	and seide , For it bihoueth mannys sone to be bitakun in to the hondis of synful men , and to be crucified , and the thridde dai to rise ayen .
42024008	And thei bithouyten on hise wordis .
42024009	And thei yeden ayen fro the graue , and telden alle these thingis to the enleuene , and to alle othir .
42024010	And ther was Marie Mawdeleyn , and Joone , and Marie of James , and other wymmen that weren with hem , that seiden to apostlis these thingis .
42024011	And these wordis weren seyn bifor hem as madnesse , and thei bileueden not to hem .
42024012	But Petir roos vp , and ran to the graue ; and he bowide doun , and say the lynen clothis liynge aloone . And he wente bi him silf , wondrynge on that that was don .
42024013	And lo ! tweyne of hem wenten in that dai in to a castel , that was fro Jerusalem the space of sixti furlongis , bi name Emaws .
42024014	And thei spaken togidir of alle these thingis that haddun bifallun .
42024015	And it was don , the while thei talkiden , and souyten bi hem silf , Jhesus hym silf neiyede , and wente with hem .
42024016	But her iyen weren holdun , that thei knewen him not .
42024017	And he seide to hem , What ben these wordis , that ye speken togidir wandrynge , and ye ben sorewful ?
42024018	And oon , whos name was Cleofas , answerde , and seide , Thou thi silf art a pilgrym in Jerusalem , and hast thou not knowun , what thingis ben don in it in these daies ?
42024019	To whom he seide , What thingis ? And thei seiden to hym , Of Jhesu of Nazareth , that was a man prophete , myyti in werk and word bifor God and al the puple ;
42024020	and hou the heiyest preestis of oure princis bitoken hym in to dampnacioun of deeth , and crucifieden hym .
42024021	But we hopiden , that he schulde haue ayenbouyt Israel . And now on alle these thingis the thridde dai is to dai , that these thingis weren don .
42024022	But also summe wymmen of ouris maden vs afered , whiche bifor dai weren at the graue ; and whanne his bodi was not foundun ,
42024023	thei camen , and seiden , that thei syen also a siyt of aungels , whiche seien , that he lyueth .
42024024	And summe of oure wenten to the graue , and thei founden so as the wymmen seiden , but thei founden not hym .
42024025	And he seide to hem , A ! foolis , and slowe of herte to bileue in alle thingis that the prophetis han spokun .
42024026	Whethir it bihofte not Crist to suffre these thingis , and so to entre in to his glorie ?
42024027	And he bigan at Moises and at alle the prophetis , and declaride to hem in alle scripturis , that weren of hym .
42024028	And thei camen nyy the castel , whidur thei wenten . And he made countenaunce that he wolde go ferthere .
42024029	And thei constreyneden hym , and seiden , Dwelle with vs , for it drawith to nyyt , and the dai is now bowid doun .
42024030	And he entride with hem . And it was don , while he sat at the mete with hem , he took breed , and blesside , and brak , and took to hem .
42024031	And the iyen of hem weren openyd , and thei knewen hym ; and he vanyschide fro her iyen .
42024032	And thei seiden togidir , Whether oure herte was not brennynge in vs , while he spak in the weie , and openyde to vs scripturis ?
42024033	And thei risen vp in the same our , and wenten ayen in to Jerusalem , and founden the enleuene gaderid togidir , and hem that weren with hem ,
42024034	seiynge , That the Lord is risun verrili , and apperide to Symount .
42024035	And thei tolden what thingis weren don in the weie , and hou thei knewen hym in brekyng of breed .
42024036	And the while thei spaken these thingis , Jhesus stood in the myddil of hem , and seide to hem , Pees to you ; Y am , nyle ye drede .
42024037	But thei weren affraied and agast , and gessiden hem to se a spirit .
42024038	And he seide to hem , What ben ye troblid , and thouytis comen vp in to youre hertis ?
42024039	Se ye my hoondis and my feet , for Y my silf am . Fele ye , and se ye ; for a spirit hath not fleisch and boonys , as ye seen that Y haue .
42024040	And whanne he hadde seid this thing , he schewide hoondis and feet to hem .
42024041	And yit while thei bileueden not , and wondriden for ioye , he seide , Han ye here ony thing that schal be etun ?
42024042	And thei proferden hym a part of a fisch rostid , and an hony combe .
42024043	And whanne he hadde etun bifore hem , he took that that lefte , and yaf to hem ;
42024044	and seide ` to hem , These ben the wordis that Y spak to you , whanne Y was yit with you ; for it is nede that alle thingis ben fulfillid , that ben writun in the lawe of Moises , and in prophetis , and in salmes , of me .
42024045	Thanne he openyde to hem wit , that thei schulden vnderstonde scripturis .
42024046	And he seide to hem , For thus it is writun , and thus it bihofte Crist to suffre , and ryse ayen fro deeth in the thridde dai ;
42024047	and penaunce and remyssioun of synnes to be prechid in his name ` in to alle folkis , bigynnynge at Jerusalem .
42024048	And ye ben witnessis of these thingis .
42024049	And Y schal sende the biheest of my fadir in to you ; but sitte ye in the citee , til that ye be clothid with vertu from an hiy .
42024050	And he ledde hem forth in to Betanye , and whanne his hondis weren lift vp , he blesside hem .
42024051	And it was don , the while he blesside hem , he departide fro hem , and was borun in to heuene .
42024052	And thei worschipiden , and wenten ayen in to Jerusalem with greet ioye ,
42024053	and weren euermore in the temple , heriynge and blessynge God .
43001001	In the bigynnyng was the word , and the word was at God , and God was the word .
43001002	This was in the bigynnyng at God .
43001003	Alle thingis weren maad bi hym , and withouten hym was maad no thing , that thing that was maad .
43001004	In hym was lijf , and the lijf was the liyt of men ; and the liyt schyneth in derknessis ,
43001005	and derknessis comprehendiden not it .
43001006	A man was sent fro God , to whom the name was Joon .
43001007	This man cam in to witnessyng , that he schulde bere witnessing of the liyt , that alle men schulden bileue bi hym .
43001008	He was not the liyt , but that he schulde bere witnessing of the liyt .
43001009	There was a very liyt , which liytneth ech man that cometh in to this world .
43001010	He was in the world , and the world was maad bi hym , and the world knew hym not .
43001011	He cam in to his owne thingis , and hise resseyueden hym not .
43001012	But hou many euer resseyueden hym , he yaf to hem power to be maad the sones of God , to hem that bileueden in his name ; the whiche not of bloodis ,
43001013	nether of the wille of fleische , nether of the wille of man , but ben borun of God .
43001014	And the word was maad man , and dwellyde among vs , and we han seyn the glorie of hym , as the glorie of the ` oon bigetun sone of the fadir , ful of grace and of treuthe .
43001015	Joon berith witnessyng of hym , and crieth , and seith , This is , whom Y seide , He that schal come aftir me , is maad bifore me , for he was tofor me ;
43001016	and of the plente of hym we alle han takun , and grace for grace .
43001017	For the lawe was youun bi Moises ; but grace and treuthe ` is maad bi Jhesu Crist .
43001018	No man sai euer God , no but the ` oon bigetun sone , that is in the bosum of the fadir , he hath teld out .
43001019	And this is the witnessyng of Joon , whanne Jewis senten fro Jerusalem prestis and dekenes to hym , that thei schulden axe hym , Who art thou ?
43001020	He knoulechide , and denyede not , and he knoulechide , For Y am not Crist .
43001021	And thei axiden hym , What thanne ? Art thou Elie ? And he seide , Y am not . Art thou a profete ? And he answeride , Nay .
43001022	Therfor thei seiden to hym , Who art thou ? that we yyue an answere to these that senten vs . What seist thou of thi silf ?
43001023	He seide , Y am a vois of a crier in deseert , Dresse ye the weie of the Lord , as Ysaie , the prophete , seide .
43001024	And thei that weren sent , weren of the Fariseis .
43001025	And thei axiden hym , and seiden to hym , What thanne baptisist thou , if thou art not Crist , nether Elie , nether a profete ?
43001026	Joon answeride to hem , and seide , Y baptise in watir , but in the myddil of you hath stonde oon , that ye knowen not ;
43001027	he it is , that schal come aftir me , that was maad bifor me , of whom Y am not worthi to louse the thwong of his schoo .
43001028	These thingis weren don in Bethanye biyende Jordan , where Joon was baptisyng .
43001029	Anothir day Joon say Jhesu comynge to hym , and he seide , Lo ! the lomb of God ; lo ! he that doith awei the synnes of the world .
43001030	This is he , that Y seide of , Aftir me is comun a man , which was maad bifor me ; for he was rather than Y .
43001031	And Y knew hym not , but that he be schewid in Israel , therfor Y cam baptisynge in watir .
43001032	And Joon bar witnessyng , and seide , That Y saiy the spirit comynge doun as a culuer fro heuene , and dwellide on hym .
43001033	And Y knew hym not ; but he that sente me to baptise in watir , seide to me , On whom thou seest the Spirit comynge doun , and dwellynge on hym , this is he , that baptisith in the Hooli Goost .
43001034	And Y say , and bar witnessyng , that this is the sone of God .
43001035	Anothir dai Joon stood , and tweyne of hise disciplis ;
43001036	and he biheeld Jhesu walkinge , and seith , Lo ! the lomb of God .
43001037	And twei disciplis herden hym spekynge ,
43001038	and folewiden Jhesu . And Jhesu turnede , and say hem suynge hym , and seith to hem , What seken ye ? And thei seiden to hym , Rabi , that is to seie , Maistir , where dwellist thou ?
43001039	And he seith to hem , Come ye , and se . And thei camen , and sayn where he dwellide ; and dwelten with hym that dai . And it was as the tenthe our .
43001040	And Andrewe , the brother of Symount Petir , was oon of the tweyne , that herden of Joon , and hadden sued hym .
43001041	This foond first his brother Symount , and he seide to him , We han foundun Messias , that is to seie , Crist ; and he ledde him to Jhesu .
43001042	And Jhesus bihelde hym , and seide , Thou art Symount , the sone of Johanna ; thou schalt be clepid Cefas , that is to seie , Petre .
43001043	And on the morewe he wolde go out in to Galilee , and he foond Filip ; and he seith to hym , Sue thou me .
43001044	Filip was of Bethsaida , the citee of Andrew and of Petre .
43001045	Filip foond Nathanael , and seide to hym , We han foundun Jhesu , the sone of Joseph , of Nazareth , whom Moyses wroot in the lawe and profetis .
43001046	And Nathanael seide to hym , Of Nazareth may sum good thing be ?
43001047	Filip seide to hym , Come , and se . Jhesus siy Nathanael comynge to hym , and seide to hym , Lo ! verili a man of Israel , in whom is no gile .
43001048	Nathanael seide to hym , Wherof hast thou knowun me ? Jhesus ` answerde , and seide to hym , Bifor that Filip clepide thee , whanne thou were vndur the fige tree , Y saiy thee . Nathanael answerde to hym ,
43001049	` and seide , Rabi , thou art the sone of God , thou art kyng of Israel .
43001050	Jhesus answerde , and seide to hym , For Y seide to thee , Y sawy thee vndur the fige tre , thou bileuest ; thou schalt se more than these thingis .
43001051	And he seide to hem , Treuli , treuli , Y seie to you , ye schulen se heuene opened , and the aungels of God stiynge vp and comynge doun on mannys sone .
43002001	And the thridde dai weddyngis weren maad in the Cane of Galilee ; and the modir of Jhesu was there .
43002002	And Jhesus was clepid , and hise disciplis , to the weddyngis .
43002003	And whanne wijn failide , the modir of Jhesu seide to hym , Thei han not wijn .
43002004	And Jhesus seith to hir , What to me and to thee , womman ? myn our cam not yit .
43002005	His modir seith to the mynystris , What euere thing he seie to you , do ye .
43002006	And there weren set ` sixe stonun cannes , aftir the clensyng of the Jewis , holdynge ech tweyne ether thre metretis .
43002007	And Jhesus seith to hem , Fille ye the pottis with watir . And thei filliden hem , vp to the mouth .
43002008	And Jhesus seide to hem , Drawe ye now , and bere ye to the architriclyn . And thei baren .
43002009	And whanne the architriclyn hadde tastid the watir maad wiyn , and wiste not wherof it was , but the mynystris wisten that drowen the watir , the architriclyn clepith the spouse ,
43002010	and seith to hym , Ech man settith first good wiyn , and whanne men ben fulfillid , thanne that that is worse ; but thou hast kept the good wiyn ` in to this tyme .
43002011	Jhesus dide this the bigynnyng of signes in the Cane of Galilee , and schewide his glorie ; and hise disciplis bileueden in hym .
43002012	Aftir these thingis he cam doun to Cafarnaum , and his modir , and hise britheren , and hise disciplis ; and thei dwelliden ` there not many daies .
43002013	And the pask of Jewis was nyy , and Jhesus wente vp to Jerusalem .
43002014	And he foond in the temple men sillynge oxun , and scheep , and culueris , and chaungeris sittynge .
43002015	And whanne he hadde maad as it were a scourge of smale cordis , he droof out alle of the temple , and oxun , and scheep ; and he schedde the money of chaungeris , and turnede vpsedoun the boordis .
43002016	And he seide to hem that selden culueris , Take awei fro hennus these thingis , and nyle ye make the hous of my fadir an hous of marchaundise .
43002017	And hise disciplis hadden mynde , for it was writun , The feruent loue of thin hous hath etun me .
43002018	Therfor the Jewis answeriden , and seiden to hym , What token schewist thou to vs , that thou doist these thingis ?
43002019	Jhesus answerde , and seide to hem , Vndo ye this temple , and in thre daies Y schal reise it .
43002020	Therfor the Jewis seiden to hym , In fourti and sixe yeer this temple was bildid , and schalt thou in thre daies reise it ?
43002021	But he seide of the temple of his bodi .
43002022	Therfor whanne he was risun fro deeth , hise disciplis hadden mynde , that he seide these thingis of his bodi ; and thei bileueden to the scripture , and to the word that Jhesus seide .
43002023	And whanne Jhesus was at Jerusalem in pask , in the feeste dai , many bileueden in his name , seynge his signes that he dide .
43002024	But Jhesus trowide not hym silf to hem , for he knewe alle men ;
43002025	and for it was not nede to hym , that ony man schulde bere witnessyng , for he wiste , what was in man .
43003001	And there was a man of the Farisees , Nychodeme bi name , a prince of the Jewis .
43003002	And he cam to Jhesu bi niyt , and seide to hym , Rabi , we witen , that thou art comun fro God maister ; for no man may do these signes , that thou doist , but God be with hym .
43003003	Jhesus answerde , and seide to hym , Treuli , treuli , Y seie to thee , but a man be borun ayen , he may not se the kyngdom of God .
43003004	Nychodeme seide to hym , Hou may a man be borun , whanne he is eeld ? whether he may entre ayen in to his modris wombe , and be borun ayen ?
43003005	Jhesus answeride , Treuli , treuli , Y seie to thee , but a man be borun ayen of watir , and of the Hooli Goost , he may not entre in to the kyngdom of God .
43003006	` That that is borun of the fleisch , is fleisch ; and ` that that is borun of spirit , is spirit .
43003007	Wondre thou not , for Y seide to thee , It bihoueth you to be borun ayen .
43003008	The spirit brethith where he wole , and thou herist his vois , but thou wost not , fro whennus he cometh , ne whidir he goith ; so is ech man that is borun of the spirit .
43003009	Nychodeme answeride , and seide to hym , Hou moun these thingis be don ?
43003010	Jhesus answeride , and seide to hym , Thou art a maister in Israel , and knowist not these thingis ?
43003011	Treuli , treuli , Y seie to thee , for we speken that that we witen , and we witnessen that that we han seyn , and ye taken not oure witnessyng .
43003012	If Y haue seid to you ertheli thingis , and ye bileuen not , hou if Y seie to you heueneli thingis , schulen ye bileue ?
43003013	And no man stieth in to heuene , but he that cam doun fro heuene , mannys sone that is in heuene .
43003014	And as Moises areride a serpent in desert , so it bihoueth mannys sone to be reisid ,
43003015	that ech man that bileueth in hym , perische not , but haue euerlastynge lijf .
43003016	For God louede so the world , that he yaf his ` oon bigetun sone , that ech man that bileueth in him perische not , but haue euerlastynge lijf .
43003017	For God sente not his sone in to the world , that he iuge the world , but that the world be saued bi him .
43003018	He that bileueth in hym , is not demed ; but he that bileueth not , is now demed , for he bileueth not in the name of the ` oon bigetun sone of God .
43003019	And this is the dom , for liyt cam in to the world , and men loueden more derknessis than liyt ; for her werkes weren yuele .
43003020	For ech man that doith yuele , hatith the liyt ; and he cometh not to the liyt , that hise werkis be not repreued .
43003021	But he that doith treuthe , cometh to the liyt , that hise werkis be schewid , that thei ben don in God .
43003022	Aftir these thingis Jhesus cam , and hise disciplis , in to the loond of Judee , and there he dwellide with hem , and baptiside .
43003023	And Joon was baptisinge in Ennon , bisidis Salym , for many watris weren there ; and thei camen , and weren baptisid .
43003024	And Joon was not yit sent in to prisoun .
43003025	Therfor a questioun was maad of Jonys disciplis with the Jewis , of the purificacioun .
43003026	And thei camen to Joon , and seiden ` to hym , Maister , he that was with thee biyonde Jordan , to whom thou hast borun witnessyng , lo ! he baptisith , and alle men comen to hym .
43003027	Joon answerde , and seide , A man may not take ony thing , but it be youun to hym fro heuene .
43003028	Ye you silf beren witnessyng to me , that Y seide , Y am not Crist , but that Y am sent bifore hym .
43003029	He that hath a wijf , is the hosebonde ; but the freend of the spouse that stondith , and herith hym , ioieth with ioye , for the vois of the spouse . Therfor in this thing my ioye is fulfillid .
43003030	It bihoueth hym to wexe , but me to be maad lesse .
43003031	He that cam from aboue , is aboue alle ; he that is of the erthe , spekith of the erthe ; he that cometh from heuene , is aboue alle .
43003032	And he witnessith that thing that he hath seie , and herde , and no man takith his witnessing .
43003033	But he that takith his witnessyng , hath confermyd that God is sothefast .
43003034	But he whom God hath sent , spekith the wordis of God ; for not to mesure God yyueth the spirit .
43003035	The fadir loueth the sone , and he hath youun alle thingis in his hoond .
43003036	He that bileueth in the sone , hath euerlastynge lijf ; but he that is vnbileueful to the sone , schal not se euerlastynge lijf , but the wraththe of God dwellith on hym .
43004001	Therfor as Jhesu knew , that the Farisees herden , that Jhesu makith and baptisith mo disciplis than Joon ,
43004002	thouy Jhesus baptiside not , but hise disciplis , he lefte Judee ,
43004003	and wente ayen in to Galilee .
43004004	And it bihofte hym to passe bi Samarie .
43004005	Therfor Jhesus cam in to a citee of Samarie , that is seid Sicar , bisidis the place , that Jacob yaf to Joseph , his sone .
43004006	And the welle of Jacob was there ; and Jhesus was weri of the iourney , and sat thus vpon the welle . And the our was , as it were the sixte .
43004007	And a womman cam fro Samarie , to drawe watir . And Jhesus seith to hir , Yyue me drynk .
43004008	And hise disciplis weren gon in to the citee , to bie mete .
43004009	Therfor thilke womman of Samarie seith to him , Hou thou , ` whanne thou art a Jewe , axist of me drynk , that am a womman of Samarie ? for Jewis vsiden not to dele with Samaritans .
43004010	Jhesus answerde , and seide to hir , If thou wistist the yifte of God , and who ` he is , that seith to thee , Yyue me drynk , thou perauenture woldist haue axid of hym , and he schulde haue youun to thee quyk watir .
43004011	The womman seith to him , Sire , thou hast not where ynne to drawe , and the pit is deep ; wherof thanne hast thou quik watir ?
43004012	Whethir thou art grettere than oure fadir Jacob , that yaf to vs the pit ? and he drank therof , and hise sones , and hise beestis .
43004013	Jhesus answerde , and seide to hir , Eche man that drynkith of this watir , schal thirste efte soone ; but he that drynkith of the watir that Y schal yyue hym , schal not thirste with outen ende ; but the watir that Y schal yyue hym ,
43004014	schal be maad in hym a welle ` of watir , spryngynge vp in to euerlastynge lijf .
43004015	The womman seith to hym , Sire , yyue me this watir , that Y thirste not , nether come hidur to drawe .
43004016	Jhesus seith to hir , Go , clepe thin hosebonde , and come hidir .
43004017	The womman answerde , and seide , Y haue noon hosebonde . Jhesus seith to hir , Thou seidist wel , That Y haue noon hosebonde ;
43004018	for thou hast hadde fyue hosebondis , and he that thou hast , is not thin hosebonde . This thing thou seidist sotheli .
43004019	The womman seith to hym , Lord , Y se , that thou art a prophete .
43004020	Oure fadris worschipiden in this hil , and ye seien , that at Jerusalem is a place , where it bihoueth to worschipe .
43004021	Jhesus seith to hir , Womman , bileue thou to me , for the our schal come , whanne nether in this hil , nethir in Jerusalem , ye schulen worschipe the fadir .
43004022	Ye worschipen that ye knowen not ; we worschipen that that we knowen ; for helthe is of the Jewis .
43004023	But the tyme is comun , and now it is , whanne trewe worschiperis schulen worschipe the fadir in spirit and treuthe ; for also the fadir sekith suche , that worschipen hym .
43004024	God is a spirit , and it bihoueth hem that worschipen hym , to worschipe in spirit and treuthe .
43004025	The womman seith to hym , Y woot that Messias is comun , that is seid Crist ; therfor whanne he cometh , he schal telle vs alle thingis .
43004026	Jhesus seith to hir , Y am he , that spekith with thee .
43004027	And anoon hise disciplis camen , and wondriden , that he spak with the womman ; netheles no man seide to hym , What sekist thou , or , What spekist thou with hir ?
43004028	Therfor the womman lefte hir watir pot , and wente in to the citee , and seide to tho men ,
43004029	Come ye , and se ye a man , that seide to me alle thingis that Y haue don ; whether he be Crist ?
43004030	And thei wenten out of the citee , and camen to hym .
43004031	In the mene while hise disciplis preieden hym , and seiden , Maistir , ete .
43004032	But he seide to hem , Y haue mete to ete , that ye knowen not .
43004033	Therfor disciplis seiden togidir , Whether ony man hath brouyt him mete to ete ?
43004034	Jhesus seith to hem , My mete is , that Y do the wille of hym that sente me , that Y perfourme the werk of hym .
43004035	Whether ye seien not , that yit foure monethis ben , and rype corn cometh ? Lo ! Y seie to you , lifte vp youre iyen , and se ye the feeldis , for now thei ben white to repe .
43004036	And he that repith takith hire , and gaderith fruyt in to euerlastynge lijf ; that bothe he that sowith , and he that repith , haue ioye togidere .
43004037	In this thing is the word trewe , for anothir is that sowith , and anothir that repith .
43004038	Y sente you to repe , that that ye ` haue not trauelid ; ` othere men han trauelid , and ye han entrid ` in to her trauels .
43004039	And of that citee many Samaritans bileueden in hym , for the word of the womman , that bare witnessyng , That he seide to me alle thingis that Y haue don .
43004040	Therfor whanne Samaritans camen to hym , thei preieden hym to dwelle there ; and he dwelte there twey daies .
43004041	And many mo bileueden for his word ,
43004042	and seiden to the womman , That now not for thi speche we bileuen ; for we han herd , and we witen , that this is verili the sauyour of the world .
43004043	And aftir twei daies he wente out fro thennus , and wente in to Galilee .
43004044	And he bar witnessyng , that a profete in his owne cuntre hath noon onour .
43004045	Therfor whanne he cam in to Galilee , men of Galilee resseyueden hym , whanne thei hadden seyn alle thingis that he hadde don in Jerusalem in the feeste dai ; for also thei hadden comun to the feeste dai .
43004046	Therfor he cam eftsoone in to the Cane of Galile , where he made the watir wiyn . And ` a litil kyng was , whos sone was sijk at Cafarnaum .
43004047	Whanne this hadde herd , that Jhesu schulde come fro Judee in to Galilee , he wente to hym , and preiede hym , that he schulde come doun , and heele his sone ; for he bigan to die .
43004048	Therfor Jhesus seide to him , But ye se tokenes and grete wondris , ye bileuen not .
43004049	The litil kyng seith to hym , Lord , come doun , bifor that my sone die .
43004050	Jhesus seith to hym , Go , thi sone lyueth . The man bileuede to the word , that Jhesus seide to hym , and he wente .
43004051	And now whanne he cam doun , the seruauntis camen ayens hym , and telden to hym , and seiden , That his sone lyuede .
43004052	And he axide of hem the our , in which he was amendid . And thei seiden to hym , For yistirdai in the seuenthe our the feuer lefte him .
43004053	Therfor the fadir knewe , that thilke our it was , in which Jhesus seide to hym , Thi sone lyueth ; and he bileuede , and al his hous .
43004054	Jhesus dide eft this secounde tokene , whanne he cam fro Judee in to Galilee .
43005001	Aftir these thingis ther was a feeste dai of Jewis , and Jhesus wente vp to Jerusalem .
43005002	And in Jerusalem is a waissynge place , that in Ebrew is named Bethsaida , and hath fyue porchis .
43005003	In these lay a greet multitude of sike men , blynde , crokid , and drie , abidynge the mouyng of the watir .
43005004	For the aungel ` of the Lord cam doun certeyne tymes in to the watir , and the watir was moued ; and he that first cam doun in to the sisterne , aftir the mouynge of the watir , was maad hool of what euer sijknesse he was holdun .
43005005	And a man was there , hauynge eiyte and thritti yeer in his sikenesse .
43005006	And whanne Jhesus hadde seyn hym liggynge , and hadde knowun , that he hadde myche tyme , he seith to hym , Wolt thou be maad hool ?
43005007	The sijk man answerde to hym , Lord , Y haue no man , that whanne the watir is moued , to putte me ` in to the cisterne ; for the while Y come , anothir goith doun bifor me .
43005008	Jhesus seith to hym , Rise vp , take thi bed , and go .
43005009	And anoon the man was maad hool , and took vp his bed , and wente forth . And it was sabat in that dai .
43005010	Therfor the Jewis seiden to him that was maad hool , It is sabat , it is not leueful to thee , to take awei thi bed .
43005011	He answeride to hem , He that made me hool , seide to me , Take thi bed , and go .
43005012	Therfor thei axiden him , What man ` is that , that seide to thee , Take vp thi bed , and go ?
43005013	But he that was maad hool , wiste not who it was . And Jhesus bowide awei fro the puple , that was set in the place .
43005014	Aftirward Jhesus foond hym in the temple , and seide to hym , Lo ! thou art maad hool ; now nyle thou do synne , lest any worse thing bifalle to thee .
43005015	Thilke man wente , and telde to the Jewis , that it was Jhesu that made hym hool .
43005016	Therfor the Jewis pursueden Jhesu , for he dide this thing in the sabat .
43005017	And Jhesus answeride to hem , My fadir worchith til now , and Y worche .
43005018	Therfor the Jewis souyten more to sle hym , for not oneli he brak the sabat , but he seide that God was his fadir , and made hym euene to God .
43005019	Therfor Jhesus answerde , and seide to hem , Treuli , treuli , Y seye to you , the sone may not of hym silf do ony thing , but that thing that he seeth the fadir doynge ; for what euere thingis he doith , the sone doith in lijk maner tho thingis .
43005020	For the fadir loueth the sone , and schewith to hym alle thingis that he doith ; and he schal schewe to hym grettere werkis than these , that ye wondren .
43005021	For as the fadir reisith deed men , and quykeneth , so the sone quykeneth whom he wole .
43005022	For nethir the fadir iugith ony man , but hath youun ech doom to the sone ,
43005023	that alle men onoure the sone , as thei onouren the fadir . He that onourith not the sone , onourith not the fadir that sente hym .
43005024	Treuli , treuli , Y seie to you , that he that herith my word , and bileueth to hym that sente me , hath euerlastynge lijf , and he cometh not in to doom , but passith fro deeth in to lijf .
43005025	Treuli , treuli Y seie to you , for the our cometh , and now it is , whanne deed men schulen here the vois of ` Goddis sone , and thei that heren , schulen lyue .
43005026	For as the fadir hath lijf in hym silf , so he yaf to the sone , to haue lijf in him silf ;
43005027	and he yaf to hym power to make doom , for he is mannys sone .
43005028	Nyle ye wondre this , for the our cometh , in which alle men that ben in birielis , schulen here the voice of Goddis sone .
43005029	And thei that han do goode thingis , schulen go in to ayenrisyng of lijf ; but thei that han done yuele thingis , in to ayenrisyng of doom .
43005030	Y may no thing do of my silf , but as Y here , Y deme , and my doom is iust , for Y seke not my wille , but the wille of the fadir that sente me .
43005031	If Y bere witnessing of my silf , my witnessyng is not trewe ;
43005032	another is that berith witnessyng of me , and Y woot that his witnessyng is trewe , that he berith of me .
43005033	Ye senten to Joon , and he bar witnessyng to treuthe .
43005034	But Y take not witnessyng of man ; but Y seie these thingis , that ye be saaf .
43005035	He was a lanterne brennynge and schynynge ; but ye wolden glade at an our in his liyt .
43005036	But Y haue more witnessyng than Joon , for the werkis that my fadir yaf to me to perfourme hem , thilke werkis that Y do beren witnessyng of me , that the fadir sente me .
43005037	And the fadir that sente me , he bar witnessyng of me . Nether ye herden euere his vois , nether ye seien his licnesse .
43005038	And ye han not his word dwellynge in you ; for ye byleuen not to hym , whom he sente .
43005039	Seke ye scripturis , in which ye gessen to haue euerlastynge lijf ; and tho it ben , that beren witnessyng of me .
43005040	And ye wolen not come to me , that ye haue lijf .
43005041	Y take not clerenesse of men ;
43005042	but Y haue knowun you , that ye han not the loue of God in you .
43005043	Y cam in the name of my fadir , and ye token not me . If another come in his owne name , ye schulen resseyue hym .
43005044	Hou moun ye bileue , that resseyuen glorie ech of othere , and ye seken not the glorie ` that is of God aloone ?
43005045	Nyle ye gesse , that Y am to accuse you anentis the fadir ; it is Moises that accusith you , in whom ye hopen .
43005046	For if ye bileueden to Moises , perauenture ye schulden bileue also to me ; for he wroot of me .
43005047	But if ye bileuen not to hise lettris , hou schulen ye bileue to my wordis ?
43006001	Aftir these thingis Jhesus wente ouere the see of Galilee , that is Tiberias .
43006002	And a greet multitude suede hym ; for thei sayn the tokenes , that he dide on hem that weren sijke .
43006003	Therfor Jhesus wente in to an hil , and sat there with hise disciplis .
43006004	And the paske was ful niy , a feeste dai of the Jewis .
43006005	Therfor whanne Jhesus hadde lift vp hise iyen , and hadde seyn , that a greet multitude cam to hym , he seith to Filip , Wherof schulen we bie looues , that these men ete ?
43006006	But he seide this thing , temptynge hym ; for he wiste what he was to do .
43006007	Filip answerde to hym , The looues of tweyn hundrid pans sufficen not to hem , that ech man take a litil what .
43006008	Oon of hise disciplis , Andrew , the brothir of Symount Petre ,
43006009	seith to him , A child is here , that hath fyue barli looues and twei fischis ; but what ben these among so manye ?
43006010	Therfor Jhesus seith , Make ye hem sitte to the mete . And there was myche hey in the place . And so men saten to the mete , as ` fyue thousynde in noumbre .
43006011	And Jhesus took fyue looues , and whanne he hadde do thankyngis , he departide to men that saten to the mete , and also of the fischis , as myche as thei wolden .
43006012	And whanne thei weren fillid , he seide to hise disciplis , Gadir ye the relifs that ben left , that thei perischen not .
43006013	And so thei gadriden , and filliden twelue cofyns of relif of the fyue barli looues and twei fischis , that lefte to hem that hadden etun .
43006014	Therfor tho men , whanne thei hadden seyn the signe that he hadde don , seiden , For this is verili the profete , that is to come in to the world .
43006015	And whanne Jhesus hadde knowun , that thei weren to come to take hym , and make hym kyng , he fleiy ` aloone eft in to an hille .
43006016	And whanne euentid was comun , his disciplis wenten doun to the see .
43006017	And thei wenten vp in to a boot , and thei camen ouer the see in to Cafarnaum . And derknessis weren maad thanne , and Jhesus was not come to hem .
43006018	And for a greet wynde blew , the see roos vp .
43006019	Therfor whanne thei hadden rowid as fyue and twenti furlongis or thretti , thei seen Jhesus walkynge on the see , and to be neiy the boot ; and thei dredden .
43006020	And he seide to hem , Y am ; nyle ye drede .
43006021	Therfor thei wolden take hym in to the boot , and anoon the boot was at the loond , to which thei wenten .
43006022	On ` the tother dai the puple , that stood ouer the see , say , that ther was noon other boot there but oon , and that Jhesu entride not with hise disciplis in to the boot , but hise disciplis aloone wenten .
43006023	But othere bootis camen fro Tiberias bisidis the place , where thei hadden eetun breed , and diden thankyngis to God .
43006024	Therfor whanne the puple hadde seyn , that Jhesu was not there , nether hise disciplis , thei wenten vp in to bootis , and camen to Cafarnaum , sekynge Jhesu .
43006025	And whanne thei hadden foundun hym ouer the see , thei seiden to hym , Rabi , hou come thou hidur ?
43006026	Jhesus answerde to hem , and seide , Treuli , treuli , Y seie to you , ye seken me , not for ye sayn the myraclis , but for ye eten of looues , and weren fillid .
43006027	Worche ye not mete that perischith , but that dwellith in to euerlastynge lijf , which mete mannys sone schal yyue to you ; for God the fadir hath markid hym .
43006028	Therfor thei seiden to hym , What schulen we do , that we worche the werkis of God ?
43006029	Jhesus answerde , and seide to hem , This is the werk of God , that ye bileue to hym , whom he sente .
43006030	Therfor thei seiden to hym , What tokene thanne doist thou , that we seen , and bileue to thee ? what worchist thou ?
43006031	Oure fadris eeten manna in desert , as it is writun , He yaf to hem breed fro heuene to ete .
43006032	Therfor Jhesus seith to hem , Treuli , treuli , Y seie to you , Moyses yaf you not breed fro heuene , but my fadir yyueth you veri breed fro heuene ;
43006033	for it is very breed that cometh doun fro heuene , and yyueth lijf to the world .
43006034	Therfor thei seiden to hym , Lord , euere yyue vs this breed .
43006035	And Jhesus seide to hem , Y am breed of lijf ; he that cometh to me , schal not hungur ; he that bileueth in me , schal neuere thirste .
43006036	But Y seid to you , that ye han seyn me , and ye bileueden not .
43006037	Al thing , that the fadir yyueth to me , schal come to me ; and Y schal not caste hym out , that cometh to me .
43006038	For Y cam doun fro heuene , not that Y do my wille , but the wille of hym that sente me .
43006039	And this is the wille of the fadir that sente me , that al thing that the fadir yaf me , Y leese not of it , but ayen reise it in the laste dai .
43006040	And this is the wille of my fadir that sente me , that ech man that seeth the sone , and bileueth in hym , haue euerlastynge lijf ; and Y schal ayen reyse hym in the laste dai .
43006041	Therfor Jewis grutchiden of hym , for he hadde seid , Y am breed that cam doun fro heuene .
43006042	And thei seiden , Whether this is not Jhesus , the sone of Joseph , whos fadir and modir we han knowun . Hou thanne seith this , That Y cam doun fro heuene ?
43006043	Therfor Jhesus answerde , and seide to hem , Nyle ye grutche togidere .
43006044	No man may come to me , but if the fadir that sente me , drawe hym ; and Y schal ayen reise hym in the laste dai . It is writun in prophetis ,
43006045	And alle men schulen be able for to be tauyt ` of God . Ech man that herde of the fadir , and hath lerned , cometh to me .
43006046	Not for ony man hath sey the fadir , but this that is of God , hath sey the fadir .
43006047	Sotheli , sotheli , Y seie to you , he that bileueth in me , hath euerlastynge lijf .
43006048	Y am breed of lijf .
43006049	Youre fadris eeten manna in desert , and ben deed .
43006050	This is breed comynge doun fro heuene , that if ony man ete therof , he die not .
43006051	Y am lyuynge breed , that cam doun fro heuene . If ony man ete of this breed , he schal lyue withouten ende . And the breed that Y schal yyue , is my fleisch for the lijf of the world .
43006052	Therfor the Jewis chidden togidere , and seiden , Hou may this yyue to vs his fleisch to ete ?
43006053	Therfor Jhesus seith to hem , Treuli , treuli , Y seie to you , but ye eten the fleisch of mannus sone , and drenken his blood , ye schulen not haue lijf in you .
43006054	He that etith my fleisch , and drynkith my blood , hath euerlastynge lijf , and Y schal ayen reise hym in the laste dai .
43006055	For my fleisch is veri mete , and my blood is very drynk .
43006056	He that etith my fleisch , and drynkith my blood , dwellith in me , and Y in hym .
43006057	As my fadir lyuynge sente me , and Y lyue for the fadir , and he that etith me , he schal lyue for me .
43006058	This is breed , that cam doun fro heuene . Not as youre fadris eten manna , and ben deed ; he that etith this breed , schal lyue withouten ende .
43006059	He seide these thingis in the synagoge , techynge in Cafarnaum .
43006060	Therfor many of hise disciplis herynge , seiden , This word is hard , who may here it ?
43006061	But Jhesus witynge at hym silf , that hise disciplis grutchiden of this thing , seide to hem , This thing sclaundrith you ?
43006062	Therfor if ye seen mannus sone stiynge , where he was bifor ?
43006063	It is the spirit that quykeneth , the fleisch profitith no thing ; the wordis that Y haue spokun to you , ben spirit and lijf .
43006064	But ther ben summe of you that bileuen not . For Jhesus wiste fro the bigynnynge , which weren bileuynge , and who was to bitraye hym .
43006065	And he seide , Therfor Y seide to you , that no man may come to me , but it were youun to hym of my fadir .
43006066	Fro this tyme many of hise disciplis wenten abak , and wenten not now with hym .
43006067	Therfor Jhesus seide to the twelue , Whether ye wolen also go awei ?
43006068	And Symount Petre answeride to hym , Lord , to whom schulen we gon ? Thou hast wordis of euerlastynge lijf ;
43006069	and we bileuen , and han knowun , that thou art Crist , the sone of God .
43006070	Therfor Jhesus answerde to hem , Whether Y chees not you twelue , and oon of you is a feend ?
43006071	And he seide this of Judas of Symount Scarioth , for this was to bitraye hym , whanne he was oon of the twelue .
43007001	Aftir these thingis Jhesus walkide in to Galilee , for he wolde not walke in to Judee , for the Jewis souyten to sle hym .
43007002	And ther was neiy a feeste dai of the Jewis , Senofegia .
43007003	And hise britheren seiden to hym , Passe fro hennus , and go in to Judee , that also thi disciplis seen thi werkis that thou doist ;
43007004	for no man doith ony thing in hiddlis , and hym silf sekith to be opyn . If thou doist these thingis , schewe thi silf to the world .
43007005	For nether hise britheren bileueden in hym .
43007006	Therfor Jhesus seith to hem , My tyme cam not yit , but youre tyme is euermore redi .
43007007	The world may not hate you , sothely it hatith me ; for Y bere witnessyng therof , that the werkis of it ben yuele .
43007008	Go ye vp to this feeste dai , but Y schal not go vp to this feeste dai , for my tyme is not yit fulfillid .
43007009	Whanne he hadde seid these thingis , he dwelte in Galilee .
43007010	And aftir that hise britheren weren gon vp , thanne he yede vp to the feeste dai , not opynli , but as in priuyte .
43007011	Therfor the Jewis souyten hym in the feeste dai , and seiden , Where is he ?
43007012	And myche grutchyng was of hym among the puple . For summe seiden , That he is good ; and othere seiden , Nai , but he disceyueth the puple ;
43007013	netheles no man spak opynli of hym , for drede of the Jewis .
43007014	But whanne the myddil feeste dai cam , Jhesus wente vp in to the temple , and tauyte .
43007015	And the Jewis wondriden , and seiden , Hou can this man lettris , sithen he hath not lerned ?
43007016	Jhesus answerde to hem , and seide , My doctryne is not myn , but his that sente me .
43007017	If ony man wole do his wille , he schal knowe of the techyng , whethir it be of God , or Y speke of my silf .
43007018	He that spekith of hym silf , sekith his owne glorie ; but he that sekith the glorie of hym that sente hym , is sothefast , and vnriytwisnesse is not in hym .
43007019	Whether Moises yaf not to you a lawe , and noon of you doith the lawe ?
43007020	What seken ye to sle me ? And the puple answerde , and seide , Thou hast a deuel ; who sekith to sle thee ?
43007021	Jhesus answerde , and seide to hem , Y haue don o werk , and alle ye wondren .
43007022	Therfor Moises yaf to you circumcisioun ; not for it is of Moyses , but of the fadris ; and in the sabat ye circumciden a man .
43007023	If a man take circumcicioun in the sabat , that the lawe of Moises be not brokun , han ye indignacioun to me , for Y made al a man hool in the sabat ?
43007024	Nile ye deme aftir the face , but deme ye a riytful doom .
43007025	Therfor summe of Jerusalem seiden , Whethir this is not he , whom the Jewis seken to sle ?
43007026	and lo ! he spekith opynli , and thei seien no thing to hym . Whether the princes knewen verili , that this is Crist ?
43007027	But we knowun this man , of whennus he is ; but whanne Crist schal come , no man woot of whennus he is .
43007028	Therfor Jhesus criede in the temple ` techynge , and seide , Ye knowen me , and ` ye knowen of whennus Y am ; and Y cam not of my silf , but he is trewe that sente me , whom ye knowen not .
43007029	Y knowe hym , and if Y seie that Y knowe hym not , Y schal be lijk to you , a liere ; but Y knowe hym , for of hym Y am , and he sente me .
43007030	Therfor thei souyten to take hym , and no man sette on hym hoondis , for his our cam not yit .
43007031	And many of the puple bileueden in hym , and seiden , Whanne Crist schal come , whether he schal do mo tokenes , than tho that this doith ?
43007032	Farisees herden the puple musinge of hym these thingis ; and the princis and Farisees senten mynystris , to take hym .
43007033	Therfor Jhesus seide to hem , Yit a litil tyme Y am with you , and Y go to the fadir , that sente me .
43007034	Ye schulen seke me , and ye schulen not fynde ; and where Y am , ye may not come .
43007035	Therfor the Jewis seiden to hem silf , Whidur schal this gon , for we schulen not fynde hym ? whether he wole go in to the scateryng of hethene men , and wole teche the hethene ?
43007036	What is this word , which he seide , Ye schulen seke me , and ye schulen not fynde ; and where Y am , ye moun not come ?
43007037	But in the laste dai of the greet feeste , Jhesus stood , and criede , and seide , If ony man thirstith , come he to me , and drynke .
43007038	He that bileueth in me , as the scripture seith , Floodis of quyk watir schulen flowe fro his wombe .
43007039	But he seide this thing of the Spirit , whom men that bileueden in hym schulden take ; for the Spirit was not yit youun , for Jhesus was not yit glorified .
43007040	Therfor of that cumpanye , whanne thei hadden herd these wordis of hym , thei seiden , This is verili a prophete .
43007041	Othere seiden , This is Crist . ` But summe seiden , Whether Crist cometh fro Galilee ?
43007042	Whether the scripture seith not , that of the seed of Dauid , and of the castel of Bethleem , where Dauid was , Crist cometh ?
43007043	Therfor discencioun was maad among the puple for hym .
43007044	For summe of hem wolden haue take hym , but no man sette hondis on hym .
43007045	Therfor the mynystris camen to bischopis and Farisees , and thei seiden to hem , Whi brouyten ye not hym ?
43007046	The mynystris answeriden , Neuere man spak so , as this man spekith .
43007047	Therfor the Farisees answeriden to hem , Whether ye ben disseyued also ?
43007048	whether ony of the pryncis or of the Farisees bileueden in hym ?
43007049	But this puple , that knowith not the lawe , ben cursid .
43007050	Nychodeme seith to hem , he that cam to hym bi nyyt , that was oon of hem , Whethir oure lawe demith a man ,
43007051	but it haue first herde of hym , and knowe what he doith ?
43007052	Thei answeriden , and seiden to hym , Whether thou art a man of Galilee also ? Seke thou scripturis , and se thou , that a prophete risith not of Galilee .
43007053	And thei turneden ayen , ech in to his hous .
43008001	But Jhesus wente in to the mount of Olyuete .
43008002	And eerli eft he cam in to the temple ; and al the puple cam to hym ; and he sat , and tauyte hem .
43008003	And scribis and Fariseis bryngen a womman takun in auoutrye , and thei settiden hir in the myddil ,
43008004	and seiden to hym , Maystir , this womman is now takun in auoutrie .
43008005	And in the lawe Moises comaundide vs to stoone suche ; therfor what seist thou ?
43008006	And thei seiden this thing temptynge hym , that thei myyten accuse hym . And Jhesus bowide hym silf doun , and wroot with his fyngur in the erthe .
43008007	And whanne thei abiden axynge hym , he reiside hym silf , and seide to hem , He of you that is without synne , first caste a stoon in to hir .
43008008	And eft he bowide hym silf , and wroot in the erthe .
43008009	And thei herynge these thingis , wenten awei oon aftir anothir , and thei bigunnen fro the eldre men ; and Jhesus dwelte aloone , and the womman stondynge in the myddil .
43008010	And Jhesus reiside hym silf , and seide to hir , Womman , where ben thei that accusiden thee ? no man hath dampned thee .
43008011	Sche seide , No man , Lord . Jhesus seide ` to hir , Nethir Y schal dampne thee ; go thou , and now aftirward nyle thou synne more .
43008012	Therfor eft Jhesus spak to hem , and seide , Y am the liyt of the world ; he that sueth me , walkith not in derknessis , but schal haue the liyt of lijf .
43008013	Therfor the Fariseis seiden , Thou berist witnessyng of thi silf ; thi witnessyng is not trewe .
43008014	Jhesus answerde , and seide to hem , And if Y bere witnessyng of my silf , my witnessyng is trewe ; for Y woot fro whennus Y cam , and whidur Y go .
43008015	But ye witen not fro whennus Y cam , ne whidur Y go . For ye demen aftir the fleisch , but Y deme no man ;
43008016	and if Y deme , my doom is trewe , for Y am not aloone , but Y and the fadir that sente me .
43008017	And in youre lawe it is writun , that the witnessyng of twei men is trewe .
43008018	Y am , that bere witnessyng of my silf , and the fadir that sente me , berith witnessyng of me .
43008019	Therfor thei seiden to hym , Where is thi fadir ? Jhesus answeride , Nether ye knowen me , nethir ye knowen my fadir ; if ye knewen me , perauenture ye schulden knowe also my fadir .
43008020	Jhesus spak these wordis in the tresorie , techynge in the temple ; and no man took hym , for his our cam not yit .
43008021	Therfor eft Jhesus seide to hem , Lo ! Y go , and ye schulen seke me , and ye schulen die in youre synne ; whidur Y go , ye moun not come .
43008022	Therfor the Jewis seiden , Whether he schal sle hym silf , for he seith , Whidur Y go , ye moun not come ?
43008023	And he seide to hem , Ye ben of bynethe , Y am of aboue ; ye ben of this world , Y am not of this world .
43008024	Therfor Y seide to you , that ye schulen die in youre synnes ; for if ye bileuen not that Y am , ye schulen die in youre synne .
43008025	Therfor thei seiden to hym , Who art thou ? Jhesus seide to hem , The bigynnyng , which also speke to you .
43008026	Y haue many thingis to speke , and deme of you , but he that sente me is sothefast ; and Y speke in the world these thingis , that Y herde of hym .
43008027	And thei knewen not , that he clepide his fadir God .
43008028	Therfor Jhesus seith to hem , Whanne ye han areisid mannus sone , thanne ye schulen knowe , that Y am , and of my silf Y do no thing ; but as my fadir tauyte me , Y speke these thingis .
43008029	And he that sente me is with me , and lefte me not aloone ; for Y do euermore tho thingis , that ben plesynge to hym .
43008030	Whanne he spak these thingis , manye bileueden in hym .
43008031	Therfor Jhesus seide to the Jewis , that bileueden in hym , If ye dwellen in my word , verili ye schulen be my disciplis ;
43008032	and ye schulen knowe the treuthe , and the treuthe schal make you fre .
43008033	Therfor the Jewis answeriden to hym , We ben the seed of Abraham , and we serueden neuere to man ; hou seist thou , That ye schulen be fre ?
43008034	Jhesus answeride to hem , Treuli , treuli , Y seie to you , ech man that doith synne , is seruaunt of synne .
43008035	And the seruaunt dwellith not in the hows with outen ende , but the sone dwellith with outen ende .
43008036	Therfor if the sone make you fre , verili ye schulen be fre .
43008037	Y woot that ye ben Abrahams sones , but ye seken to sle me , for my word takith not in you .
43008038	Y speke tho thingis , that Y say at my fadir ; and ye doen tho thingis , that ye sayn at youre fadir .
43008039	Thei answerden , and seiden to hym , Abraham is oure fadir . Jhesus seith to hem , If ye ben the sones of Abraham , do ye the werkis of Abraham .
43008040	But now ye seken to sle ` me , a man that haue spoken to you treuthe , that Y herde of God ; Abraham dide not this thing .
43008041	Ye doen the werkis of youre fadir . Therfor thei seiden to hym , We ben not borun of fornycacioun ; we han o fadir , God .
43008042	But Jhesus seith to hem , If God were youre fadir , sotheli ye schulden loue me ; for Y passide forth of God , and cam ; for nether Y cam of my silf , but he sente me .
43008043	Whi knowen ye not my speche ? for ye moun not here my word .
43008044	Ye ben of the fadir , the deuel , and ye wolen do the desyris of youre fadir . He was a mansleere fro the bigynnyng , and he stood not in treuthe ; for treuthe is not in hym . Whanne he spekith lesyng , he spekith of his owne ; for he is a liere , and fadir of it .
43008045	But for Y seie treuthe , ye bileuen not to me .
43008046	Who of you schal repreue me of synne ? if Y sey treuthe , whi bileuen ye not to me ?
43008047	He that is of God , herith the wordis of God ; therfor ye heren not , for ye ben not of God .
43008048	Therfor the Jewis answeriden , and seiden , Whether we seien not wel , that thou art a Samaritan , and hast a deuel ?
43008049	Jhesus answerde , and seide , Y haue not a deuel , but Y onoure my fadir , and ye han vnhonourid me .
43008050	For Y seke not my glorye ; there is he , that sekith , and demeth .
43008051	Treuli , treuli , Y seie to you , if ony man kepe my word , he schal not taste deth with outen ende .
43008052	Therfor the Jewis seiden , Now we han knowun , that thou hast a deuel . Abraham is deed , and the prophetis , and thou seist , If ony man kepe my word , he schal not taste deth withouten ende .
43008053	Whether thou art grettere than oure fader Abraham , that is deed , and the prophetis ben deed ; whom makist thou thi silf ?
43008054	Jhesus answeride , If Y glorifie my silf , my glorie is nouyt ; my fadir , is that glorifieth me , whom ye seien , that he is youre God .
43008055	And ye han not knowun hym , but Y haue knowun hym ; and if Y seie that Y knowe hym not , Y schal be a liere lich to you ; but Y knowe hym , and Y kepe his word .
43008056	Abraham , youre fadir , gladide to se my dai ; and he saiy , and ioyede .
43008057	Thanne the Jewis seiden to hym , Thou hast not yit fifti yeer , and hast thou seien Abraham ?
43008058	Therfor Jhesus seide to hem , Treuli , treuli , Y seie to you , bifor that Abraham schulde be , Y am .
43008059	Therfor thei token stonys , to caste to hym ; but Jhesus hidde hym , and wente out of the temple .
43009001	And Jhesus passynge , seiy a man blynd fro the birthe .
43009002	And hise disciplis axiden hym , Maistir , what synnede this man , or hise eldris , that he schulde be borun blynd ?
43009003	Jhesus answeride , Nether this man synnede , nether hise eldris ; but that the werkis of God be schewid in hym .
43009004	It bihoueth me to worche the werkis of hym that sente me , as longe as the dai is ; the nyyt schal come , whanne no man may worche .
43009005	As longe as Y am in the world , Y am the liyt of the world .
43009006	Whanne he hadde seid these thingis , he spette in to the erthe , and made cley of the spotil , and anoyntide the cley on hise iyen ,
43009007	and seide to hym , Go , and be thou waisschun in the watir of Siloe , that is to seie , Sent . Thanne he wente , and waisschide , and cam seynge .
43009008	And so neiyboris , and thei that hadden seyn him bifor , for he was a beggere , seiden , Whether this is not he , that sat , and beggide ?
43009009	Othere men seiden , That this it is ; othere men seyden , Nai , but he is lijc hym .
43009010	But he seide , That Y am . Therfor thei seiden to hym , Hou ben thin iyen openyd ?
43009011	He answerde , Thilke man , that is seid Jhesus , made clei , and anoyntide myn iyen , and seide to me , Go thou to the watre of Siloe , and wassche ; and Y wente , and wasschide , and say .
43009012	And thei seiden to hym , Where is he ? He seide , Y woot not .
43009013	Thei leden hym that was blynd to the Farisees .
43009014	And it was sabat , whanne Jhesus made cley , and openyde hise iyen .
43009015	Eft the Farisees axiden hym , hou he hadde seyn . And he seide to hem , He leide to me cley on the iyen ; and Y wasschide , and Y se .
43009016	Therfor summe of the Fariseis seiden , This man is not of God , that kepith not the sabat . Othere men seiden , Hou may a synful man do these signes . And strijf was among hem .
43009017	Therfor thei seien eftsoone to the blynd man , What seist thou of hym , that openyde thin iyen ? And he seide , That he is a prophete .
43009018	Therfor Jewis bileueden not of hym , that he was blynd , and hadde seyn , til thei clepiden his fadir and modir , that hadde seyn .
43009019	And thei axiden hem , and seiden , Is this youre sone , which ye seien was borun blynd ? hou thanne seeth he now ?
43009020	His fadir and modir answeriden to hem , and seiden , We witen , that this is oure sone , and that he was borun blynd ;
43009021	but hou he seeth now , we witen neuer , or who openyde hise iyen , we witen nere ; axe ye hym , he hath age , speke he of hym silf .
43009022	His fader and modir seiden these thingis , for thei dredden the Jewis ; for thanne the Jewis hadden conspirid , that if ony man knoulechide hym Crist , he schulde be don out of the synagoge .
43009023	Therfor his fadir and modir seiden , That he hath age , axe ye hym .
43009024	Therfor eftsoone thei clepiden the man , that was blynd , and seiden to hym , Yyue thou glorie to God ; we witen , that this man is a synnere .
43009025	Thanne he seide , If he is a synnere , Y woot neuer ; o thing Y woot , that whanne Y was blynd , now Y se .
43009026	Therfor thei seiden to hym , What dide he to thee ? hou openyde he thin iyen ?
43009027	He answerde to hem , Y seide to you now , and ye herden ; what wolen ye eftsoone here ? whether ye wolen be maad hise discyplis ?
43009028	Therfor thei cursiden hym , and seiden , Be thou his disciple ; we ben disciplis of Moises .
43009029	We witen , that God spak to Moises ; but we knowen not this , of whennus he is .
43009030	Thilke man answeride , and seide to hem , For in this is a wondurful thing , that ye witen not , of whennus he is , and he hath openyd myn iyen .
43009031	And we witen , that God herith not synful men , but if ony ` man is worschypere of God , and doith his wille , he herith hym .
43009032	Fro the world it is not herd , that ony man openyde the iyen of a blynd borun man ; but this were of God ,
43009033	he myyt not do ony thing .
43009034	Thei answeriden , and seiden to hym , Thou art al borun in synnes , and techist thou vs ? And thei putten hym out .
43009035	Jhesus herd , that thei hadden putte hym out ; and whanne he hadde founde hym , he seide to hym , Bileuest thou in the sone of God ?
43009036	He answerde , and seide , Lord , who is he , that Y bileue in hym ?
43009037	And Jhesus seide to hym , And thou hast seyn him , and he it is , that spekith with thee .
43009038	And he seide , Lord , Y byleue . And he felle doun , and worschipide hym .
43009039	Therfore Jhesus seide to hym , Y cam in to this world , ` in to doom , that thei that seen not , see , and thei that seen , be maad blynde .
43009040	And summe of the Faryseis herden , that weren with hym , and thei seiden to hym , Whether we ben blynde ?
43009041	Jhesus seide to hem , If ye weren blynde , ye schulden not haue synne ; but now ye seien , That we seen , youre synne dwellith stille .
43010001	Treuli , treuli , Y seie to you , he that cometh not in by the dore in to the foold of scheep , but stieth bi another weie , is a nyyt theef and a dai theef .
43010002	But he that entrith bi the dore , is the scheepherde of the scheep .
43010003	To this the porter openeth , and the scheep heren his vois , and he clepith his owne scheep bi name , and ledith hem out .
43010004	And whanne he hath don out his owne scheep , he goith bifor hem , and the scheep suen hym ; for thei knowun his vois .
43010005	But thei suen not an alien , but fleen from hym ; for thei han not knowun the vois of aliens .
43010006	Jhesus seide to hem this prouerbe ; but thei knewen not what he spak to hem .
43010007	Therfor Jhesus seide to hem eftsoone , Treuli , treuli , Y seie to you , that Y am the dore of the scheep .
43010008	As many as han come , weren nyyt theues and day theues , but the scheep herden not hem .
43010009	Y am the dore . If ony man schal entre bi me , he schal be sauyd ; and he schal go ynne , and schal go out , and he schal fynde lesewis .
43010010	A nyyt theef cometh not , but that he stele , sle , and leese ; and Y cam , that thei han lijf , and haue more plenteousli .
43010011	I am a good scheepherde ; a good scheepherde yyueth his lijf for hise scheep .
43010012	But an hirid hyne , and that is not the scheepherde , whos ben not the scheep his owne , seeth a wolf comynge , and he leeueth the scheep , and fleeth ; and the wolf rauyschith , and disparplith the scheep .
43010013	And the hirid hyne fleeth , for he is an hirid hyne , and it parteyneth not to hym of the scheep .
43010014	Y am a good scheepherde , and Y knowe my scheep , and my scheep knowen me .
43010015	As the fadir hath knowun me , Y knowe the fadir ; and Y putte my lijf for my scheep .
43010016	Y haue othere scheep , that ben not of this foolde , and it bihoueth me to brynge hem togidir , and thei schulen here my vois ; and it schal be maad o foolde and o scheepherde .
43010017	Therfor the fadir loueth me , for Y putte my lijf , that eftsoone Y take it .
43010018	No man takith it fro me , but Y putte it of my silf . Y haue power to putte it , and Y haue power to take it ayen . This maundement Y haue takun of my fadir .
43010019	Eft dissencioun was maad among the Jewis for these wordis .
43010020	And many of hem seiden , He hath a deuel , and maddith ; what heren ye hym ?
43010021	Othere men seiden , These wordis ben not of a man that hath a feend . Whether the deuel may opene the iyen of blynde men ?
43010022	But the feestis of halewyng of the temple weren maad in Jerusalem , and it was wyntir .
43010023	And Jhesus walkide in the temple , in the porche of Salomon .
43010024	Therfor the Jewis camen aboute hym , and seiden to hym , Hou long takist thou awei oure soule ? if thou art Crist , seie thou to vs opynli .
43010025	Jhesus answerde to hem , Y speke to you , and ye bileuen not ; the werkis that Y do in the name of my fadir , beren witnessyng of me .
43010026	But ye bileuen not , for ye ben not of my scheep .
43010027	My scheep heren my vois , and Y knowe hem , and thei suen me .
43010028	And Y yyue to hem euerelastynge lijf , and thei schulen not perische with outen ende , and noon schal rauysche hem fro myn hoond .
43010029	That thing that my fadir yaf to me , is more than alle thingis ; and no man may rauysche fro my fadris hoond .
43010030	Y and the fadir ben oon .
43010031	The Jewis token vp stoonys , to stoone hym .
43010032	Jhesus answerde to hem , Y haue schewide to you many good werkis of my fadir , for which werk of hem stonen ye me ?
43010033	The Jewis answerden to hym , We stoonen thee not of good werk , but of blasfemye , and for thou , sithen thou art a man , makist thi silf God .
43010034	Jhesus answerde to hem , Whether it is not writun in youre lawe , That Y seide , Ye ben goddis ?
43010035	Yf he seide that thei weren goddis , to whiche the word of God was maad , and scripture may not be vndon ,
43010036	thilke that the fadir hath halewid , and hath sent in to the world , ye seien , That ` thou blasfemest , for Y seide , Y am Goddis sone ?
43010037	Yf Y do not the werkis of my fadir , nyle ye bileue to me ;
43010038	but if Y do , thouy ye wolen not bileue to me , bileue ye to the werkis ; that ye knowe and bileue , that the fadir is in me , and Y in the fadir .
43010039	Therfor thei souyten to take hym , and he wente out of her hondis .
43010040	And he wente eftsoone ouer Jordan , in to that place where Joon was firste baptisynge , and he dwelte there .
43010041	And manye camen to hym , and seiden , For Joon dide no myracle ;
43010042	and alle thingis what euer Joon seide of this , weren sothe . And many bileueden in hym .
43011001	And ther was a sijk man , Lazarus of Bethanye , of the castel of Marie and Martha , hise sistris .
43011002	And it was Marye , which anoyntide the Lord with oynement , and wipte hise feet with hir heeris , whos brother Lazarus was sijk .
43011003	Therfor hise sistris senten to hym , and seide , Lord , lo ! he whom thou louest , is sijk .
43011004	And Jhesus herde , and seide to hem , This syknesse is not to the deth , but for the glorie of God , that mannus sone be glorified bi hym .
43011005	And Jhesus louyde Martha , and hir sistir Marie , and Lazarus .
43011006	Therfor whanne Jhesus herde , that he was sijk , thanne he dwellide in the same place twei daies .
43011007	And after these thingis he seide to hise disciplis , Go we eft in to Judee .
43011008	The disciplis seien to hym , Maister , now the Jewis souyten for to stoone thee , and eft goist thou thidir ?
43011009	Jhesus answerde , Whether ther ben not twelue ouris of the dai ? If ony man wandre in the dai , he hirtith not , for he seeth the liyt of this world .
43011010	But if he wandre in the niyt , he stomblith , for liyt is not in him .
43011011	He seith these thingis , and aftir these thingis he seith to hem , Lazarus , oure freend , slepith , but Y go to reise hym fro sleep .
43011012	Therfor hise disciplis seiden , Lord , if he slepith , he schal be saaf .
43011013	But Jhesus hadde seid of his deth ; but thei gessiden , that he seide of slepyng of sleep .
43011014	Thanne therfor Jhesus seide to hem opynli , Lazarus is deed ;
43011015	and Y haue ioye for you , that ye bileue , for Y was not there ; but go we to hym .
43011016	Therfor Thomas , that is seid Didymus , seide to euen disciplis , Go we also , that we dien with hym .
43011017	And so Jhesus cam , and foond hym hauynge thanne foure daies in the graue .
43011018	And Bethany was bisidis Jerusalem , as it were fiftene furlongis .
43011019	And many of the Jewis camen to Mary and Martha , to coumforte hem of her brothir .
43011020	Therfor as Martha herde , that Jhesu cam , sche ran to hym ; but Mary sat at home .
43011021	Therfor Martha seide to Jhesu , Lord , if thou haddist be here , my brother hadde not be deed .
43011022	But now Y woot , that what euere thingis thou schalt axe of God , God schal yyue to thee .
43011023	Jhesus seith to hir , Thi brother schal rise ayen .
43011024	Martha seith to hym , Y woot , that he schal rise ayen in the ayen risyng in the laste dai .
43011025	Jhesus seith to hir , Y am ayen risyng and lijf ; he that bileueth in me , yhe , thouy he be deed ,
43011026	he schal lyue ; and ech that lyueth , and bileueth in me , schal not die with outen ende . Bileuest thou this thing ?
43011027	Sche seith to hym , Yhe , Lord , Y haue bileued , that thou art Crist , the sone of the lyuynge God , that hast come in to this world .
43011028	And whanne sche hadde seid this thing , sche wente , and clepide Marie , hir sistir , in silence , and seide , The maister cometh , and clepith thee .
43011029	Sche , as sche herd , aroos anoon , and cam to hym .
43011030	And Jhesus cam not yit ` in to the castel , but he was yit in that place , where Martha hadde comun ayens hym .
43011031	Therfor the Jewis that weren with hir in the hous , and coumfortiden hir , whanne thei sayn Marie , that sche roos swithe , and wente out , thei sueden hir , and seiden , For sche goith to the graue , to wepe there .
43011032	But whanne Marie was comun where Jhesus was , sche seynge hym felde doun to his feet , and seide to hym , Lord , if thou haddist be here , my brother hadde not be deed .
43011033	And therfor whanne Jhesu saiy hir wepyng , and the Jewis wepynge that weren with hir , he ` made noise in spirit , and troblide hym silf ,
43011034	and seide , Where han ye leid hym ? Thei seien to hym , Lord , come , and se .
43011035	And Jhesus wepte . Therfor the Jewis seiden ,
43011036	Lo ! hou he louede hym .
43011037	And summe of hem seiden , Whethir this man that openyde the iyen of the borun blynde man , myyte not make that this schulde not die ?
43011038	Therfor Jhesus eft makynge noise in hym silf , cam to the graue . And there was a denne , and a stoon was leid theronne .
43011039	And Jhesus seith , Take ye awey the stoon . Martha , the sistir of hym that was deed , seith to hym , Lord , he stynkith now , for he hath leye foure daies .
43011040	Jhesus seith to hir , Haue Y not seid to thee , that if thou bileuest , thou schalt se the glorie of God ?
43011041	Therfor thei token awei the stoon . And Jhesus lifte vp hise iyen , and seide , Fadir , Y do thankyngis to thee , for thou hast herd me ; and Y wiste ,
43011042	that thou euermore herist me , but for the puple that stondith aboute , Y seide , that thei bileue , that thou hast sent me .
43011043	Whanne he hadde seid these thingis , he criede with a greet vois , Lazarus , come thou forth .
43011044	And anoon he that was deed , cam out , boundun the hondis and feet with boondis , and his face boundun with a sudarie . And Jhesus seith to hem , Vnbynde ye hym , and suffre ye hym to go forth .
43011045	Therfor many of the Jewis that camen to Marie and Martha , and seyn what thingis Jhesus dide , bileueden in hym .
43011046	But summe of hem wente to the Farisees , and seiden to hem , what thingis Jhesus ` hadde don .
43011047	Therfor the bischopis and the Farisees gadriden a counsel ayens Jhesu , and seiden , What do we ? for this man doith many myraclis .
43011048	If we leeue hym thus , alle men schulen bileue in hym ; and Romayns schulen come , and schulen take our place and oure folk .
43011049	But oon of hem , Cayfas bi name , whanne he was bischop of that yeer , seide to hem ,
43011050	Ye witen nothing , ne thenken , that it spedith to you , that o man die for the puple , and that al the folc perische not .
43011051	But he seide not this thing of hym silf , but whanne he was bischop of that yeer , he prophesiede , that Jhesu was to die for the folc ,
43011052	and not oneli for the folc , but that he schulde gadere in to oon the sones of God that weren scaterid .
43011053	Therfor fro that day thei souyten for to sle hym .
43011054	Therfor Jhesus walkide not thanne opynli among the Jewis ; but he wente in to a cuntre bisidis desert , in to a citee , that is seid Effren , and there he dwellide with hise disciplis .
43011055	And the pask of the Jewis was niy , and many of the cuntrey wenten vp to Jerusalem bifor the pask , to halewe hem silf .
43011056	Therfor thei souyten Jhesu , and spaken togidere , stondynge in the temple , What gessen ye , for he cometh not to the feeste day ?
43011057	For the bischopis and Farisees hadden youun a maundement , that if ony man knowe where he is , that he schewe , that thei take hym .
43012001	Therfor Jhesus bifor sixe daies of pask cam to Bethanye , where Lazarus hadde be deed , whom Jhesus reiside .
43012002	And thei maden to hym a soopere there , and Martha mynystride to hym ; and Lazarus was oon of men that saten at the mete with hym .
43012003	Therfor Marie took a pound of oynement of trewe narde precious , and anoyntide the feet of Jhesu , and wipte hise feet with hir heeris ; and the hous was fulfillid of the sauour of the oynement .
43012004	Therfor Judas Scarioth , oon of hise disciplis , that was to bitraye hym ,
43012005	seide , Whi is not this oynement seeld for thre hundrid pens , and is youun to nedi men ?
43012006	But he seide this thing , not for it perteynede to hym of nedi men , but for he was a theef , and he hadde the pursis , and bar tho thingis that weren sent .
43012007	Therfor Jhesus seide , Suffre ye hir , that in to the day of my biriyng sche kepe that ;
43012008	for ye schulen euermore haue pore men with you , but ye schulen not euermore haue me .
43012009	Therfore myche puple of Jewis knew , that Jhesus was there ; and thei camen , not oonli for Jhesu , but to se Lazarus , whom he hadde reisid fro deth .
43012010	But the princis of prestis thouyten to sle Lazarus ,
43012011	for manye of the Jewis wenten awei for him , and bileueden in Jhesu .
43012012	But on the morew a myche puple , that cam togidere to the feeste dai , whanne thei hadden herd , that Jhesus cam to Jerusalem ,
43012013	token braunchis of palmes , and camen forth ayens hym , and crieden , Osanna , blessid is the kyng of Israel , that cometh in the name of the Lord .
43012014	And Jhesus foond a yonge asse , and sat on hym ,
43012015	as it is writun , The douytir of Syon , nyle thou drede ; lo ! thi kyng cometh , sittynge on ` an asse fole .
43012016	Hise disciplis knewen not first these thingis , but whanne Jhesus was glorified , thanne thei hadden mynde , for these thingis weren writun of hym , and these thingis thei diden to hym .
43012017	Therfor the puple bar witnessyng , that was with hym , whanne he clepide Lazarus fro the graue , and reiside hym fro deth .
43012018	And therfor the puple cam , and mette with hym , for thei herden that he hadde don this signe .
43012019	Therfor the Farisees seiden to hem silf , Ye seen , that we profiten no thing ; lo ! al the world wente aftir hym .
43012020	And there weren summe hethene men , of hem that hadden come vp to worschipe in the feeste dai .
43012021	And these camen to Filip , that was of Bethsaida of Galilee , and preieden hym , and seiden , Sire , we wolen se Jhesu .
43012022	Filip cometh , and seith to Andrew ; eft Andrew and Filip seiden to Jhesu .
43012023	And Jhesus answerde ` to hem , and seide , The our cometh , that mannus sone be clarified .
43012024	Treuli , treuli , Y seie to you , but a corn of whete falle in to the erthe , and be deed , it dwellith aloone ;
43012025	but if it be deed , it bryngith myche fruyt . He that loueth his lijf , schal leese it ; and he that hatith his lijf in this world , kepith it in to euerlastynge lijf .
43012026	If ony man serue me , sue he me ; and where Y am , there my mynystre schal be . If ony man serue me , my fadir schal worschipe hym .
43012027	Now my soule is troublid , and what schal Y seie ? Fadir , saue me fro this our ; but therfor Y cam in to this our ;
43012028	fadir , clarifie thi name . And a vois cam fro heuene , and seide , And Y haue clarified , and eft Y schal clarifie .
43012029	Therfor the puple that stood , and herde , seide , that ` thundur was maad ; othere men seide , an aungel spak to hym .
43012030	Jhesus answerde , and seide , This vois cam not for me , but for you .
43012031	Now is the doom of the world , now the prince of this world schal be cast out .
43012032	And if Y schal be enhaunsid fro the erthe , Y schal drawe alle thingis to my silf .
43012033	And he seide this thing , signifiynge bi what deth he ` was to die .
43012034	And the puple answeride to hym , We han herd of the lawe , that Crist dwellith with outen ende ; and hou seist thou , It bihoueth mannys sone to be arerid ?
43012035	Who is this mannus sone ? And thanne Jhesus seith to hem , Yit a litil liyt is in you ; walke ye , the while ye han liyt , that derknessis catche you not ; he that wandrith in derknessis , woot nere whidur he goith .
43012036	While ye han liyt , bileue ye in liyt , that ye be the children of liyt . Jhesus spak these thingis , and wente , and hidde hym fro hem .
43012037	And whanne he hadde don so many myraclis bifor hem , thei bileueden not ` in to hym ;
43012038	that the word of Ysaie , the prophete , schulde be fulfillid , which he seide , Lord , who bileuede to oure heryng , and to whom is the arm of the Lord schewid ?
43012039	Therfor thei myyten not bileue , for eft Ysaye seide ,
43012040	He hath blyndid her iyen , and he hath maad hard the herte of hem , that thei se not with iyen , and vndurstonde with herte ; and that thei be conuertid , and Y heele hem .
43012041	Ysaye seide these thingis , whanne he say the glorie of hym , and spak of hym .
43012042	Netheles ` of the pryncis manye bileueden in hym , but for the Farisees thei knowlechiden not , that thei schulden not be put out of the synagoge ;
43012043	for thei loueden the glorie of men , more than the glorie of God .
43012044	And Jhesus criede , and seide , He that bileueth in me , bileueth not in me , but in hym that sente me .
43012045	He that seeth me , seeth hym that sente me .
43012046	Y liyt cam in to the world , that ech that bileueth in me , dwelle not in derknessis .
43012047	And if ony man herith my words , and kepith hem , Y deme hym not ; for Y cam not , that Y deme the world , but that Y make the world saaf .
43012048	He that dispisith me , and takith not my wordis , hath hym that schal iuge hym ; thilke word that Y haue spokun , schal deme hym in the last dai .
43012049	For Y haue not spokun of my silf , but thilke fadir that sente me , yaf to me a maundement , what Y schal seie , and what Y schal speke .
43012050	And Y woot , that his maundement is euerlastynge lijf ; therfor tho thingis that Y speke , as the fadir seide to me , so Y speke .
43013001	Bifor the ` feeste dai of pask Jhesus witynge , that his our is comun , that he passe fro this world to the fadir , whanne he hadde loued hise that weren in the world , in to the ende he louede hem .
43013002	And whanne the souper was maad , whanne the deuel hadde put than in to the herte , that Judas of Symount Scarioth schulde bitraye hym ,
43013003	he witynge that the fadir yaf alle thingis to hym in to hise hoondis , and that he wente out fro God ,
43013004	and goith to God , he risith fro the souper , and doith of hise clothis ; and whanne he hadde takun a lynun cloth , he girde hym .
43013005	And aftirward he putte watir in to a basyn , and biganne to waische the disciplis feet , and to wipe with the lynnen cloth , with which he was gird .
43013006	And so he cam to Symount Petre , and Petre seith to hym , Lord , waischist thou my feet ?
43013007	Jhesus answerde , and seide to hym , What Y do , thou wost not now ; but thou schalt wite aftirward .
43013008	Petre seith to hym , Thou schalt neuere waische my feet . Jhesus answeride to hym , If Y schal not waische thee , thou schalt not haue part with me .
43013009	Symount Petre seith to hym , Lord , not oneli my feet , but bothe the hoondis and the heed .
43013010	Jhesus seide to hym , He that is waischun , hath no nede but that he waische the feet , but he is al clene ; and ye ben clene , but not alle .
43013011	For he wiste , who ` was he that schulde bitraye hym ; therfor he seide , Ye ben not alle clene .
43013012	And so aftir that he hadde waischun ` the feet of hem , he took hise clothis ; and whanne he was set to mete ayen , eft he seide to hem , Ye witen what Y haue don to you .
43013013	Ye clepen me maistir and lord , and ye seien wel ; for Y am .
43013014	Therfor if Y , lord and maistir , haue waischun youre feet , and ye schulen waische oon anothers feet ;
43013015	for Y haue youun ` ensaumple to you , ` that as I haue do to you , so do ye .
43013016	Treuli , treuli , Y seie to you , the seruaunt is not grettere than his lord , nether an apostle is grettere than he that sente hym .
43013017	If ye witen these thingis , ye schulen be blessid , if ye doen hem .
43013018	Y seie not of ` alle you , Y woot whiche Y haue chosun ; but that the scripture be fulfillid , He that etith my breed , schal reise his heele ayens me .
43013019	Treuly , Y seie to you bifor it be don , that whanne it is don , ye bileue that Y am .
43013020	Treuli , treuli , Y seie to you , he that takith whom euere Y schal sende , resseyueth me ; and he that resseyueth me , resseyueth hym that sente me .
43013021	Whanne Jhesus hadde seid these thingis , he was troblid in spirit , and witnesside , and seide , Treuli , treuli , Y seie to you , that oon of you schal bitraye me .
43013022	Therfor the disciplis lokiden togidere , doutynge of whom he seide .
43013023	And so oon of hise disciplis was restynge in the bosum of Jhesu , whom Jhesu louede .
43013024	Therfor Symount Petre bikeneth to hym , ` and seith to hym , Who is it , of whom he seith ?
43013025	And so whanne he hadde restid ayen on the brest of Jhesu , he seith to hym , Lord , who is it ?
43013026	Jhesus answerde , He it is , to whom Y schal areche a sop of breed . And whanne he hadde wet breed , he yaf to Judas of Symount Scarioth .
43013027	And aftir the mussel , thanne Sathanas entride in to hym . And Jhesus seith to hym , That thing that thou doist , do thou swithe .
43013028	And noon of hem that saten at the mete wiste , wherto he seide to hym .
43013029	For summe gessiden , for Judas hadde pursis , that Jhesus hadde seid to hym , Bie thou tho thingis , that ben nedeful to vs to the feeste dai , or that he schulde yyue sum thing to nedi men .
43013030	Therfor whanne he hadde takun the mussel , he wente out anoon ; and it was nyyt .
43013031	And whanne he was gon out , Jhesus seide , Now mannus sone is clarified , and God is clarified in hym .
43013032	If God is clarified in hym , God schal clarifie hym in hym silf , and anoon he schal clarifie hym .
43013033	Litle sones , yit a litil Y am with you ; ye schulen seke me , and , as Y seide to the Jewis , Whidur Y go , ye moun not come ; and to you Y seie now .
43013034	Y yyue to you a newe maundement , that ye loue togidir , as Y louede you , ` and that ye loue togidir .
43013035	In this thing alle men schulen knowe , that ye ben my disciplis , if ye han loue togidere .
43013036	Symount Petre seith to hym , Lord , whidur goist thou ? Jhesus answeride , Whidur Y go , thou mayst not sue me now , but thou schalt sue afterward .
43013037	Petre seith to hym , Whi may Y not sue thee now ? Y schal putte my lijf for thee .
43013038	Jhesus answeride , Thou schalt putte thi lijf for me ? Treuli , treuli , Y seie to thee , the cok schal not crowe , til thou schalt denye me thries . And he seith to hise disciplis .
43014001	Be not youre herte afraied , ne drede it ; ye bileuen in God , and bileue ye in me .
43014002	In the hous of my fadir ben many dwellyngis ; if ony thing lesse , Y hadde seid to you , for Y go to make redi to you a place .
43014003	And if Y go , and make redi to you a place , eftsoones Y come , and Y schal take you to my silf , that where Y am , ye be .
43014004	And whidur Y go , ye witen , and ye witen the weie .
43014005	Thomas seith to hym , Lord , we witen not whidur thou goist , and hou moun we wite the weie ?
43014006	Jhesus seith to hym , Y am weie , treuthe , and lijf ; no man cometh to the fadir , but bi me .
43014007	If ye hadden knowe me , sotheli ye hadden knowe also my fadir ; and aftirward ye schulen knowe hym , and ye han seyn hym .
43014008	Filip seith to hym , Lord , schewe to vs the fadir , and it suffisith to vs .
43014009	Jhesus seith to hym , So long tyme Y am with you , and ` han ye not knowun me ? Filip , he that seeth me , seeth also the fadir . Hou seist thou , schewe to vs the fadir ?
43014010	Bileuest thou not , that Y am in the fadir , and the fadir is in me ? The wordis that Y speke to you , Y speke not of my silf ; but the fadir hym silf dwellynge in me , doith the werkis .
43014011	Bileue ye not , that Y am in the fadir , and the fadir is in me ?
43014012	Ellis bileue ye for thilke werkis . Treuli , treuli , Y seie to you , if a man bileueth in me , also he schal do the werkis that Y do ; and he schal do grettere werkis than these , for Y go to the fadir .
43014013	And what euere thing ye axen the fadir in my name , Y schal do this thing , that the fadir be glorified in the sone .
43014014	If ye axen ony thing in my name , Y schal do it .
43014015	If ye louen me , kepe ye my comaundementis .
43014016	And Y schal preye the fadir , and he schal yyue to you another coumfortour ,
43014017	the spirit of treuthe , to dwelle with you with outen ende ; which spirit the world may not take , for it seeth hym not , nether knowith hym . But ye schulen knowe hym , for he schal dwelle with you , and he schal be in you .
43014018	Y schal not leeue you fadirles , Y schal come to you .
43014019	Yit a litil , and the world seeth not now me ; but ye schulen se me , for Y lyue , and ye schulen lyue .
43014020	In that dai ye schulen knowe , that Y am in my fadir , and ye in me , and Y in you .
43014021	He that hath my comaundementis , and kepith hem , he it is that loueth me ; and he that loueth me , schal be loued of my fadir , and Y schal loue hym , and Y schal schewe to hym my silf .
43014022	Judas seith to hym , not he of Scarioth , Lord , what is don , that thou schalt schewe thi silf to vs , and not to the world ?
43014023	Jhesus answerde , and seide ` to hym , If ony man loueth me , he schal kepe my word ; and my fadir schal loue hym , and we schulen come to hym , and we schulen dwelle with hym .
43014024	He that loueth me not , kepith not my wordis ; and the word which ye han herd , is not myn , but the fadris , that sente me .
43014025	These thingis Y haue spokun to you , dwellynge among you ; but thilke Hooli Goost ,
43014026	the coumfortour , whom the fadir schal sende in my name , he schal teche you alle thingis , ` and schal schewe to you alle thingis , what euere thingis Y schal seie to you .
43014027	Pees Y leeue to you , my pees Y yyue to you ; not as the world yyueth , Y yiue to you ; be not youre herte affrayed , ne drede it .
43014028	Ye han herd , that Y seide to you , Y go , and come to you . If ye loueden me , forsothe ye schulden haue ioye , for Y go to the fadir , for the fadir is grettere than Y .
43014029	And now Y haue seid to you , bifor that it be don , that whanne it is don , ye bileuen .
43014030	Now Y schal not speke many thingis with you ; for the prince of this world cometh , and hath not in me ony thing .
43014031	But that the world knowe , that Y loue the fadir ; and as the fadir yaf a comaundement to me , so Y do . ` Rise ye , go we hennus .
43015001	Y am a very vyne , and my fadir is an erthe tilier .
43015002	Ech braunch in me that berith not fruyt , he schal take awey it ; and ech that berith fruyt , he schal purge it , that it bere the more fruyt .
43015003	Now ye ben clene , for the word that Y haue spokun to you .
43015004	Dwelle ye in me , and Y in you ; as a braunche may not make fruyt of it silf , but it dwelle in the vyne , so nether ye , but ye dwelle in me .
43015005	Y am a vyne , ye the braunchis . Who that dwellith in me , and Y in hym , this berith myche fruyt , for with outen me ye moun no thing do .
43015006	If ony man dwellith not in me , he schal be caste out as a braunche , and schal wexe drie ; and thei schulen gadere hym , and thei schulen caste hym in to the fier , and he brenneth .
43015007	If ye dwellen in me , and my wordis dwelle in you , what euer thing ye wolen , ye schulen axe , and it schal be don to you .
43015008	In this thing my fadir is clarified , that ye brynge forth ful myche fruyt , and that ye be maad my disciplis .
43015009	As my fadir louede me , Y haue loued you ; dwelle ye in my loue .
43015010	If ye kepen my comaundementis , ye schulen dwelle in my loue ; as Y haue kept the comaundementis of my fadir , and Y dwelle in his loue .
43015011	These thingis Y spak to you , that my ioye be in you , and youre ioye be fulfillid .
43015012	This is my comaundement , that ye loue togidere , as Y louede you .
43015013	No man hath more loue than this , that a man putte his lijf for hise freendis .
43015014	Ye ben my freendis if ye doen tho thingis , that Y comaunde to you .
43015015	Now Y schal not clepe you seruauntis , for the seruaunt woot not , what his lord schal do ; but Y haue clepid you freendis , for alle thingis what euere Y herde of my fadir , Y haue maad knowun to you .
43015016	Ye han not chosun me , but Y chees you ; and Y haue put you , that ye go , and brynge forth fruyt , and youre fruyt dwelle ; that what euere thing ye axen the fadir in my name , he yyue to you .
43015017	These thingis Y comaunde to you , that ye loue togidere .
43015018	If the world hatith you , wite ye , that it hadde me in hate rather than you .
43015019	If ye hadden be of the world , the world schulde loue that thing that was his ; but for ye ben not of the world , but Y chees you fro the world , therfor the world hatith you .
43015020	Haue ye mynde of my word , which Y seide to you , The seruaunt is not grettere than his lord . If thei han pursued me , thei schulen pursue you also ; if thei han kept my word , thei schulen kepe youre also .
43015021	But thei schulen do to you alle these thingis for my name , for thei knowen not hym that sente me .
43015022	If Y hadde not comun , and hadde not spokun to hem , thei schulden not haue synne ; but now thei haue noon excusacioun of her synne .
43015023	He that hatith me , hatith also my fadir .
43015024	If Y hadde not doon werkis in hem , whiche noon other man dide , thei schulden not haue synne ; but now both thei han seyn , and hatid me and my fadir .
43015025	But that the word be fulfillid , that is writun in her lawe , For thei hadden me in hate with outen cause .
43015026	But whanne the coumfortour schal come , which Y schal sende to you fro the fadir , a spirit of treuthe , which cometh of the fadir , he schal bere witnessyng of me ;
43015027	and ye schulen bere witnessyng , for ye ben with me fro the bigynnyng .
43016001	These thingis Y haue spokun to you , that ye be not sclaundrid .
43016002	Thei schulen make you with outen the synagogis , but the our cometh , that ech man that sleeth you , deme that he doith seruyce to God .
43016003	And thei schulen do to you these thingis , for thei han not knowun the fadir , nether me .
43016004	But these thingis Y spak to you , that whanne the our ` of hem schal come , ye haue mynde , that Y seide to you .
43016005	Y seide not to you these thingis fro the bigynnyng , for Y was with you . And now Y go to hym that sente me , and no man of you axith me , Whidur ` thou goist ?
43016006	but for Y haue spokun to you these thingis , heuynesse hath fulfillid youre herte .
43016007	But Y seie to you treuthe , it spedith to you , that Y go ; for if Y go not forth , the coumfortour schal not come to you ; but if Y go forth , Y schal sende hym to you .
43016008	And whanne he cometh , he schal repreue the world of synne , and of riytwisnesse , and of doom .
43016009	Of synne , for thei han not bileued in me ;
43016010	and of riytwisnesse , for Y go to the fadir , and now ye schulen not se me ;
43016011	but of doom , for the prince of this world is now demed .
43016012	Yit Y haue many thingis for to seie to you , but ye moun not bere hem now .
43016013	But whanne thilke spirit of treuthe cometh , he schal teche you al trewthe ; for he schal not speke of hym silf , but what euer thinges he schal here , he schal speke ; and he schal telle to you tho thingis that ben to come .
43016014	He schal clarifie me , for of myne he schal take , and schal telle to you .
43016015	Alle thingis ` whiche euer the fadir hath , ben myne ; therfor Y seide to you , for of myne he schal take , and schal telle to you .
43016016	A litil , and thanne ye schulen not se me ; and eftsoone a litil , and ye schulen se me , for Y go to the fadir .
43016017	Therfor summe of hise disciplis seiden togidere , What is this thing that he seith to vs , A litil , and ye schulen not se me ; and eftsoone a litil , and ye schulen se me , for Y go to the fadir ?
43016018	Therfor thei seiden , What is this that he seith to vs , A litil ? we witen not what he spekith .
43016019	And Jhesus knew , that thei wolden axe hym , and he seide to hem , Of this thing ye seken among you , for Y seide , A litil , and ye schulen not se me ; and eftsoone a litil , and ye schulen se me .
43016020	Treuli , treuli , Y seie to you , that ye schulen mourne and wepe , but the world schal haue ioye ; and ye schulen be soreuful , but youre sorewe schal turne in to ioye .
43016021	A womman whanne sche berith child , hath heuynesse , for hir tyme is comun ; but whanne sche hath borun a sone , now sche thenkith not on the peyne , for ioye , for a man is borun in to the world .
43016022	And therfor ye han now sorew , but eftsoone Y schal se you , and youre herte schal haue ioie , and no man schal take fro you youre ioie .
43016023	And in that day ye schulen not axe me ony thing ; treuli , treuli , ` Y seie to you , if ye axen the fadir ony thing in my name , he schal yyue to you .
43016024	` Til now ye axiden no thing in my name ; ` axe ye , ` and ye schulen take , that youre ioie be ful .
43016025	Y haue spokun to you these thingis in prouerbis ; the our cometh , whanne now Y schal not speke to you in prouerbis , but opynli of my fadir Y schal telle to you .
43016026	In that dai ye schulen axe in my name ; and Y seie not to you , that Y schal preye the fadir of you ;
43016027	for the fadir hym silf loueth you , for ye han loued me , and han bileued , that Y wente out fro God .
43016028	Y wente out fro the fadir , and Y cam in to the world ; eftsoone Y leeue the world , and Y go to the fadir .
43016029	Hise disciplis seiden to hym , Lo ! now thou spekist opynli , and thou seist no prouerbe .
43016030	Now we witen , that thou wost alle thingis ; and it is not nede to thee , that ony man axe thee . In this thing we bileuen , that thou wentist out fro God .
43016031	Jhesus answeride to hem , Now ye bileuen .
43016032	Lo ! the our cometh , and now it cometh , that ye be disparplid , ech in to hise owne thingis , and that ye leeue me aloone ; and Y am not aloone , for the fadir is with me .
43016033	These thingis Y haue spokun to you , that ye haue pees in me ; in the world ye schulen haue disese , but trust ye , Y haue ouercomun the world .
43017001	These thingis Jhesus spak , and whanne he hadde cast vp hise iyen in to heuene , he seide , Fadir , the our cometh , clarifie thi sone , that thi sone clarifie thee .
43017002	As thou hast youun to hym power on ech fleisch , that al thing that thou hast youun to hym , he yyue to hem euerlastynge lijf .
43017003	And this is euerlastynge lijf , that thei knowe thee very God aloone , and whom thou hast sent , Jhesu Crist .
43017004	Y haue clarified thee on the erthe , Y haue endid the werk , that thou hast youun to me to do .
43017005	And now , fadir , clarifie thou me at thi silf , with the clerenesse that Y hadde at thee , bifor the world was maad .
43017006	Y haue schewid thi name to tho men , whiche thou hast youun to me of the world ; thei weren thine , and thou hast youun hem to me , and thei han kept thi word .
43017007	And now thei han knowun , that alle thingis that thou hast youun to me , ben of thee .
43017008	For the wordis that thou hast youun to me , Y yaf to hem ; and thei han takun , and han knowun verili , that Y wente out fro thee ; and thei bileueden , that thou sentist me .
43017009	Y preie for hem , Y preye not for the world , but for hem that thou hast youun to me , for thei ben thine .
43017010	And alle my thingis ben thine , and thi thingis ben myne ; and Y am clarified in hem .
43017011	And now Y am not in the world , and these ben in the world , and Y come to thee . Hooli fadir , kepe hem in thi name , whiche thou yauest to me , that thei ben oon , as we ben .
43017012	While Y was with hem , Y kepte hem in thi name ; thilke that thou yauest to me , Y kepte , and noon of hem perischide , but the sone of perdicioun , that the scripture be fulfillid .
43017013	But now Y come to thee , and Y speke these thingis in the world , that thei haue my ioie fulfillid in hem silf .
43017014	Y yaf to hem thi word , and the world hadde hem in hate ; for thei ben not of the world , as Y am not of the world .
43017015	Y preye not , that thou take hem awei fro the world , but that thou kepe hem fro yuel .
43017016	They ben not of the world , as Y am not of the world .
43017017	Halewe thou hem in treuth ; thi word is treuthe .
43017018	As thou sentist me in to the world , also Y sente hem ` in to the world .
43017019	And Y halewe my silf for hem , that also thei ben halewid in treuthe .
43017020	And Y preye not oneli for hem , but also for hem that schulden bileue in to me bi the word of hem ;
43017021	that all ben oon , as thou , fadir , in me , and Y in thee , that also thei in vs be oon ; that the world bileue , that thou hast sent me .
43017022	And Y haue youun to hem the clerenesse , that thou hast youun to me , that thei ben oon ,
43017023	as we ben oon ; Y in hem , and thou in me , that thei be endid in to oon ; and that the world knowe , that thou sentist me , and hast loued hem , as thou hast loued also me .
43017024	Fadir , thei whiche thou yauest to me , Y wole that where Y am , that thei be with me , that thei see my clerenesse , that thou hast youun to me ; for thou louedist me bifor the makyng of the world .
43017025	Fadir , riytfuli the world knew thee not , but Y knew thee , and these knewen , that thou sentist me .
43017026	And Y haue maad thi name knowun to hem , and schal make knowun ; that the loue bi which thou ` hast loued me , be in hem , and Y in hem .
43018001	Whanne Jhesus hadde seid these thingis , he wente out with hise disciplis ouer the strond of Cedron , where was a yerd , in to which he entride , and hise disciplis .
43018002	And Judas , that bitrayede hym , knew the place , for ofte Jhesus cam thidur with hise disciplis .
43018003	Therfor whanne Judas hadde takun a cumpany of knyytis , and mynystris of the bischopis and of the Fariseis , he cam thidur with lanternys , and brondis , and armeris .
43018004	And so Jhesus witynge alle thingis that weren to come on hym , wente forth , and seide to hem , Whom seken ye ?
43018005	Thei answeriden to hym , Jhesu of Nazareth . Jhesus seith to hem , Y am . And Judas that bitraiede hym , stood with hem .
43018006	And whanne he seide to hem , Y am , thei wenten abak , and fellen doun on the erthe .
43018007	And eft he axide hem , Whom seken ye ? And thei seiden , Jhesu of Nazareth .
43018008	He answeride to hem , Y seide to you , that Y am ; therfor if ye seken me , suffre ye these to go awei .
43018009	That the word which he seide schulde be fulfillid , For Y loste not ony of hem , whiche thou ` hast youun to me .
43018010	Therfor Symount Petre hadde a swerd , and drow it out , and smoot the seruaunt of the bischop , and kittide of his riyt eer . And the name of the seruaunt was Malcus .
43018011	Therfor Jhesus seide to Petre , Putte thou thi swerd in to thi schethe ; wolt thou not , that Y drynke the cuppe , that my fadir yaf to me ?
43018012	Therfor the cumpenye of knyytis , and the tribune , and the mynystris of the Jewis , token Jhesu , and bounden hym ,
43018013	and ledden hym first to Annas ; for he was fadir of Caifas wijf , that was bischop of that yeer .
43018014	And it was Caifas , that yaf counsel to the Jewis , that it spedith , that o man die for the puple .
43018015	But Symount Petre suede Jhesu , and another disciple ; and thilke disciple was knowun to the bischop . And he entride with Jhesu , in to the halle of the bischop ;
43018016	but Petre stood at the dore with outforth . Therfor ` the tother disciple , that was knowun to the bischop , wente out , and seide to the womman that kepte the dore , and brouyte in Petre .
43018017	And the damysel , kepere of the dore , seide to Petre , Whether thou art also of this mannys disciplis ? He seide , Y am not .
43018018	And the seruantis and mynystris stooden at the coolis , for it was coold , and thei warmyden hem ; and Petre was with hem , stondynge and warmynge hym .
43018019	And the bischop axide Jhesu of hise disciplis , and of his techyng .
43018020	Jhesus answerde to hym , Y haue spokun opynli to the world ; Y tauyte euermore in the synagoge , and in the temple , whider alle the Jewis camen togidere , and in hiddlis Y spak no thing .
43018021	What axist thou me ? axe hem that herden , what Y haue spokun to hem ; lo ! thei witen , what thingis Y haue seid .
43018022	Whanne he hadde seid these thingis , oon of the mynystris stondynge niy , yaf a buffat to Jhesu , and seide , Answerist thou so to the bischop ?
43018023	Jhesus answeride to hym , If Y haue spokun yuel , bere thou witnessyng of yuel ; but if Y seide wel , whi smytist thou me ?
43018024	And Annas sente hym boundun to Caifas , the bischop .
43018025	And Symount Petre stood , and warmyde him ; and thei seiden to hym , Whether also thou art his disciple ? He denyede , and seide , Y am not .
43018026	Oon of the bischops seruantis , cosyn of hym , whos eere Petre kitte of , seide , Say Y thee not in the yerd with hym ?
43018027	And Petre eftsoone denyede , and anoon the cok crew .
43018028	Thanne thei ledden Jhesu to Cayfas , in to the moot halle ; and it was eerli , and thei entriden not in to the moot halle , that thei schulden not be defoulid , but that thei schulden ete pask .
43018029	Therfor Pilat wente out with outforth to hem , and seide , What accusyng brynge ye ayens this man ?
43018030	Thei answeriden , and seiden to hym , If this were not a mysdoere , we hadden not bitakun hym to thee .
43018031	Thanne Pilat seith to hem , Take ye hym , and deme ye him , after youre lawe . And the Jewis seiden to hym , It is not leueful to vs to sle ony man ;
43018032	that the word of Jhesu schulde be fulfillid , whiche he seide , signifiynge bi what deth he schulde die .
43018033	Therfor eftsoone Pilat entride in to the moot halle , and clepide Jhesu , and seide to hym , Art thou kyng of Jewis ?
43018034	Jhesus answerde , and seide to hym , Seist thou this thing of thi silf , ether othere han seid to thee of me ?
43018035	Pilat answeride , Whether Y am a Jewe ? Thi folc and bischops bitoken thee to me ; what hast thou don ?
43018036	Jhesus answeride , My kingdom is not of this world ; if my kingdom were of this world , my mynystris schulden stryue , that Y schulde not be takun to the Jewis ; but now my kingdom is not here .
43018037	And so Pilat seide to hym , Thanne ` thou art a king . Jhesus answeride , Thou seist , that Y am a king . To this thing Y am borun , and to this Y ` am comun in to the world , to bere witnessing to treuthe . Eche that is of treuthe , herith my vois .
43018038	Pilat seith to hym , What is treuthe ? And whanne he hadde seid this thing , eft he wente out to the Jewis , and seide to hem , Y fynde no cause in hym .
43018039	But it is a custom to you , that Y delyuere oon to you in pask ; therfor wole ye that Y delyuere to you the kyng of Jewis ?
43018040	Alle crieden eftsoone , and seiden , Not this , but Baraban . And Barabas was a theef .
43019001	Therfor Pilat took thanne Jhesu , and scourgide .
43019002	And kniytis writhen a coroun of thornes , and setten on his heed , and diden aboute hym a cloth of purpur ,
43019003	and camen to him , and seiden , Heil , kyng of Jewis . And thei yauen to him buffatis .
43019004	Eftsoone Pilat wente out , and seide to hem , Lo ! Y brynge hym out to you , that ye knowe , that Y fynde no cause in him .
43019005	And so Jhesus wente out , berynge a coroun of thornes , and a cloth of purpur . And he seith to hem , Lo ! the man .
43019006	But whanne the bischopis and mynystris hadden seyn hym , thei crieden , and seiden , Crucifie , crucifie hym . Pilat seith to hem , Take ye hym , and crucifie ye , for Y fynde no cause in hym .
43019007	The Jewis answeriden to hym . We han a lawe , and bi the lawe he owith to die , for he made hym Goddis sone .
43019008	Therfor whanne Pilat hadde herd this word , he dredde the more .
43019009	And he wente in to the moot halle eftsoone , and seide to Jhesu , Of whennus art thou ? But Jhesus yaf noon answere to him .
43019010	Pilat seith to him , Spekist thou not to me ? Woost thou not , that Y haue power to crucifie thee , and Y haue power to delyuere thee ?
43019011	Jhesus answeride , Thou schuldist not ` haue ony power ayens me , but it were youun to thee from aboue ; therfor he that bitook me to thee , hath the more synne .
43019012	Fro that tyme Pilat souyte to delyuere hym ; but the Jewis crieden , and seiden , If thou delyuerist this man , thou art not the emperouris freend ; for ech man that makith hym silf king , ayen seith the emperoure .
43019013	And Pilat , whanne he hadde herd these wordis , ledde Jhesu forth , and sat for domesman in a place , that is seid Licostratos , but in Ebrew Golgatha .
43019014	And it was pask eue , as it were the sixte our . And he seith to the Jewis , Lo ! youre king .
43019015	But thei crieden , and seiden , Take awei , take awei ; crucifie him . Pilat seith to hem , Schal I crucifie youre king ? The bischops answeriden , We han no king but the emperour .
43019016	And thanne Pilat bitook him to hem , that he schulde be crucified . And thei token Jhesu , and ledden him out .
43019017	And he bar to hym silf a cros , and wente out in to that place , that is seid of Caluarie , in Ebreu Golgatha ;
43019018	where thei crucifieden him , and othere tweyne with him , oon on this side and oon on that side , and Jhesus in the myddil .
43019019	And Pilat wroot a title , and sette on the cros ; and it was writun , Jhesu of Nazareth , king of Jewis .
43019020	Therfor manye of the Jewis redden this title , for the place where Jhesus was crucified , was niy the citee , and it was writun in Ebreu , Greek , and Latyn .
43019021	Therfor the bischops of the Jewis seiden to Pilat , Nyle thou write kyng of Jewis , but for he seide , Y am king of Jewis .
43019022	Pilat answeride , That that Y haue writun , Y haue writun .
43019023	Therfor the knyytis whanne thei hadden crucified hym , token hise clothis , and maden foure partis , to ech knyyt a part , and a coot . And the coot was without seem , and wouun al aboute .
43019024	Therfor thei seiden togidere , Kitte we not it , but caste we lot , whos it is ; that the scripture be fulfillid , seiynge , Thei partiden my clothis to hem , and on my cloth thei casten lot . And the kniytis diden these thingis .
43019025	But bisidis the cros of Jhesu stoden his modir , and the sistir of his modir , Marie Cleofe , and Marie Maudeleyne .
43019026	Therfor whanne Jhesu hadde seyn his modir , and the disciple stondynge , whom he louyde , he seith to hise modir , Womman , lo thi sone .
43019027	Aftyrward he seith to the disciple , Lo ! thi modir . And fro that our the disciple took hir in to his modir .
43019028	Aftirward Jhesus witynge , that now alle thingis ben endid , that the scripture were fulfillid , he seith , Y thirste .
43019029	And a vessel was set ful of vynegre . And thei ` leiden in isope aboute the spounge ful of vynegre , and putten to his mouth .
43019030	Therfor whanne Jhesus hadde ` takun the vynegre , he seid , It is endid . And ` whanne his heed was bowid doun , ` he yaf vp the goost .
43019031	Therfor for it was the pask eue , that the bodies schulden not abide on the cros in the sabat , for that was a greet sabat dai , the Jewis preiden Pilat , that the hipis of hem schulden be brokun , and thei takun awei .
43019032	Therfor knyytis camen , and thei braken the thies of the firste , and of the tothere , that was crucified with hym .
43019033	But whanne thei weren comun to Jhesu , as thei sayn him deed thanne , thei braken not hise thies ;
43019034	but oon of the knyytis openyde his side with a spere , and anoon blood and watir wenten out .
43019035	And he that saiy , bare witnessyng , and his witnessing is trewe ; and he woot that he seith trewe thingis , that ye bileue .
43019036	And these thingis weren don , that the scripture schulde be fulfillid , Ye schulen not breke a boon of hym .
43019037	And eftsoone another scripture seith , Thei schulen se in whom thei piyten thorow .
43019038	But after these thingis Joseph of Armathi preyede Pilat , that he schulde take awei the bodi of Jhesu , for that he was a disciple of Jhesu , but priui for drede of the Jewis . And Pilat suffride . And so he cam , and took awei the bodi of Jhesu .
43019039	And Nychodeme cam also , that hadde come to hym first bi nyyt , and brouyte a meddlynge of myrre and aloes , as it were an hundrid pound .
43019040	And thei token the bodi of Jhesu , and boundun it in lynun clothis with swete smellynge oynementis , as it is custom to Jewis for to birie .
43019041	And in the place where he was crucified , was a yerd , and in the yerd a newe graue , in which yit no man was leid .
43019042	Therfor there thei putten Jhesu , for the vigilie of Jewis feeste , for the sepulcre was niy .
43020001	And in o dai of the wouke Marie Maudeleyn cam eerli to the graue , whanne it was yit derk . And sche say the stoon moued awei fro the graue .
43020002	Therfor sche ran , and cam to Symount Petre , and to another disciple , whom Jhesus louede , and seith to hem , Thei han takun the Lord fro the graue , and we witen not , where thei han leid hym .
43020003	Therfor Petre wente out , and thilke other disciple , and thei camen to the graue .
43020004	And thei tweyne runnen togidre , and thilke othere disciple ran bifor Petre , and cam first to the graue .
43020005	And whanne he stoupide , he sai the schetis liynge , netheles he entride not .
43020006	Therfor Symount Petre cam suynge hym , and he entride in to the graue , and he say the schetis leid ,
43020007	and the sudarie that was on his heed , not leid with the schetis , but bi it silf wlappid in to a place .
43020008	Therfor thanne thilke disciple that cam first to the graue , entride , and sai , and bileuede .
43020009	For thei knewen not yit the scripture , that it behofte him to rise ayen fro deth .
43020010	Therfor the disciplis wenten eftsoone to hem silf .
43020011	But Marie stood at the graue with outforth wepynge . And the while sche wepte , sche bowide hir , and bihelde forth in to the graue .
43020012	And sche sai twei aungels sittinge in white , oon at the heed and oon at the feet , where the bodi of Jhesu was leid .
43020013	And thei seien to hir , Womman , what wepist thou ? Sche seide to hem , For thei han take awei my lord , and Y woot not , where thei han leid him .
43020014	Whanne sche hadde seid these thingis , sche turnede bacward , and sai Jhesu stondinge , and wiste not that it was Jhesu .
43020015	Jhesus seith to hir , Womman , what wepist thou ? whom sekist thou ? She gessynge that he was a gardynere , seith to him , Sire , if thou hast takun him vp , seie to me , where thou hast leid him , and Y schal take hym awei .
43020016	Jhesus seith to hir , Marie . Sche ` turnede , and seith to hym , Rabony , that is to seie , Maister .
43020017	Jhesus seith to hir , Nyle thou touche me , for Y haue not yit stied to my fadir ; but go to my britheren , and seie to hem , Y stie to my fadir and to youre fadir , to my God and to youre God .
43020018	Marie Maudeleyne cam , tellinge to the disciplis , That Y sai the Lord , and these thingis he seide to me .
43020019	Therfor whanne it was eue in that dai , oon of the sabatis , and the yatis weren schit , where the disciplis weren gaderid , for drede of the Jewis , Jhesus cam , and stood in the myddil of the disciplis , and he seith to hem , Pees to you .
43020020	And whanne he hadde seid this , he schewide to hem hondis and side ; therfor the disciplis ioieden , for the Lord was seyn .
43020021	And he seith to hem eft , Pees to you ; as the fadir sente me , Y sende you .
43020022	Whanne he had seid this , he blewe on hem , and seide , Take ye the Hooli Goost ;
43020023	whos synnes ye foryyuen , tho ben foryouun to hem ; and whos ye withholden , tho ben withholdun .
43020024	But Thomas , oon of the twelue , that is seid Didimus , was not with hem , whanne Jhesus cam .
43020025	Therfor the othere disciplis seiden , We han seyn the Lord . And he seide to hem , But Y se in hise hondis the fitchinge of the nailis , and putte my fyngur in to the places of the nailis , and putte myn hond in to his side , Y schal not bileue .
43020026	And after eiyte daies eftsoone hise disciplis weren with ynne , and Thomas with hem . Jhesus cam , while the yatis weren schit , and stood in the myddil , and seide , Pees to you .
43020027	Afterward he seith to Thomas , Putte in here thi fyngur , and se myn hondis , and putte hidur thin hond , and putte in to my side , and nyle thou be vnbileueful , but feithful .
43020028	Thomas answeride , and seide to him , My Lord and my God .
43020029	Jhesus seith to him , Thomas , for thou hast seyn me , thou bileuedist ; blessid ben thei , that seyn not , and han bileued .
43020030	And Jhesus dide many othere signes in the siyt of hise disciplis , whiche ben not writun in this book .
43020031	But these ben writun , that ye bileue , that Jhesus ` is Crist , the sone of God , and that ye bileuynge haue lijf in his name .
43021001	Afterward Jhesus eftsoone schewide hym to hise disciplis , at the see of Tiberias .
43021002	And he schewide him thus . There weren togidere Symount Petre , and Thomas , that is seid Didimus , and Nathanael , that was of the Cane of Galilee , and the sones of Zebedee , and tweyne othere of hise disciplis .
43021003	Symount Petre seith to hem , Y go to fische . Thei seyn to hym , And we comen with thee . And ` thei wenten out , ` and wenten in to a boot . And in that niyt thei token no thing .
43021004	But whanne the morewe was comun , Jhesus stood in the brenke ; netheles the disciplis knewen not , that it was Jhesus .
43021005	Therfor Jhesus seith to hem , Children , whethir ye han ony souping thing ? Thei answeriden to hym , Nay . He seide to hem ,
43021006	Putte ye the nett in to the riyt half of the rowing , and ye schulen fynde . And thei puttiden the nett ; and thanne thei miyten not drawe it for multitude of fischis .
43021007	Therfor thilke disciple , whom Jhesus louede , seide to Petre , It is the Lord . Symount Petre , whanne he hadde herd that it is the Lord , girte hym with a coote , for he was nakid , and wente in to the see .
43021008	But the othere disciplis camen bi boot , for thei weren not fer fro the lond , but as a two hundrid cubitis , drawinge the nett of fischis .
43021009	And as thei camen doun in to the lond , thei sayn coolis liynge , and a fisch leid on , and breed .
43021010	Jhesus seith to hem , Bringe ye of the fyschis , whiche ye han takun now .
43021011	Symount Petre wente vp , and drowy the nett in to the lond , ful of grete fischis , an hundrid fifti and thre ; and whanne thei weren so manye , the nett was not brokun .
43021012	Jhesus seith to hem , Come ye , ete ye . And no man of hem that saten at the mete , durste axe hym , Who art thou , witinge that it is the Lord .
43021013	And Jhesus cam , and took breed , an yaf to hem , and fisch also .
43021014	Now this thridde tyme Jhesus was schewid to hise disciplis , whanne he hadde risun ayen fro deth .
43021015	And whanne thei hadde etun , Jhesus seith to Simount Petre , Symount of Joon , louest thou me more than these ? He seith to him , Yhe , Lord , thou woost that Y loue thee . Jhesus seith to hym , Fede thou my lambren .
43021016	Eft he seith to hym , Symount of Joon , louest thou me ? He seith to him , Yhe , Lord , thou woost that Y loue thee . He seith to him , Fede thou my lambren .
43021017	He seith to him the thridde tyme , Simount of Joon , louest thou me ? Petre was heuy , for he seith to hym the thridde tyme , Louest thou me , and he seith to him , Lord , thou knowist alle thingis ; thou woost that Y loue thee . Jhesus seith to hym , Fede my scheep .
43021018	Treuli , treuli , Y seie to thee , whanne thou were yongere , thou girdidist thee , and wandridist where thou woldist ; but whanne thou schalt waxe eldere , thou schalt holde forth thin hondis , and another schal girde thee , and schal lede thee whidur thou wolt not .
43021019	He seide this thing , signifynge bi what deth he schulde glorifie God . And whanne he hadde seid these thingis , he seith to hym , Sue thou me .
43021020	Petre turnede , and say thilke disciple suynge , whom Jhesus louede , which also restid in the soper on his brest , and he seide to hym , Lord , who is it , that schal bitraie thee ?
43021021	Therfor whanne Petre hadde seyn this , he seith to Jhesu , Lord , but what this ?
43021022	Jhesus seith to him , So I wole that he dwelle til that Y come , what to thee ? sue thou me .
43021023	Therfor this word wente out among the britheren , that thilke disciple dieth not . And Jhesus seide not to hym , that he dieth not , but , So Y wole that he dwelle til Y come , what to thee ?
43021024	This is thilke disciple , that berith witnessyng of these thingis , and wroot hem ; and we witen , that his witnessyng is trewe .
43021025	And ther ben also manye othere thingis that Jhesus dide , whiche if thei ben writun bi ech bi hym silf , Y deme that the world hym silf schal not take tho bookis , that ben to be writun .
44001001	Theofle , first ` Y made a sermoun of alle thingis , that Jhesu bigan to do and to teche ,
44001002	in to the daie of his ascencioun , in which he comaundide bi the Hooli Goost to hise apostlis , whiche he hadde chosun ;
44001003	to whiche he schewide hym silf ` alyue aftir his passioun , by many argumentis , apperinge to hem fourti daies , and spekinge of the rewme of God .
44001004	And he ete with hem , and comaundide , that thei schulden not departe fro Jerusalem , but abide the biheest of the fadir , which ye herden , he seide , bi my mouth ;
44001005	for Joon baptiside in watir , but ye schulen be baptisid in the Hooli Goost , aftir these fewe daies .
44001006	Therfor thei that weren come to gidere , axiden hym , and seiden , Lord , whether in this time thou schalt restore the kingdom of Israel ?
44001007	And he seide to hem , It is not youre to knowe the tymes ether momentis , whiche the fadir hath put in his power ;
44001008	but ye schulen take the vertu of the Hooli Goost comynge fro aboue in to you , and ye schulen be my witnessis in Jerusalem , and in al Judee , and Samarie , and to the vtmeste of the erthe .
44001009	And whanne he had seid these thingis , in her siyt he was lift vp , and a cloude resseyuede him fro her iyen .
44001010	And whanne thei biheelden hym goynge in to heuene , lo ! ` twei men stoden bisidis hem in white clothing , and seiden ,
44001011	Men of Galile , what stonden ye biholdinge in to heuene ? This Jhesu , which is takun vp ` fro you in to heuene , schal come , as ye seyn hym goynge in to heuene .
44001012	Thanne thei turneden ayen to Jerusalem , fro the hille that is clepid ` the hille of Olyuete , which is bisidis Jerusalem an halidaies iourney .
44001013	And whanne thei weren entrid in to the hous , where thei dwelliden , thei wenten vp in to the soler , Petir and Joon , James and Andreu , Philip and Thomas , Bartholomew and Matheu , James of Alphei , and Symount Zelotes , and Judas of James .
44001014	Alle these weren lastingli contynuynge with o wille in preier , with wymmen , and Marie , the moder of Jhesu , and with hise britheren .
44001015	In tho daies Petre roos vp in the myddil of the britheren , and seide ; and ther was a company of men togidere , almest an hundrid and twenti ;
44001016	Britheren , it bihoueth that the scripture be fillid , whiche the Hooly Goost bifore seide bi the mouth of Dauith , of Judas that was ledere of hem that token Jhesu ;
44001017	and was noumbrid among vs , and gat a part of this seruyce .
44001018	And this Judas hadde a feeld of the hire of wickidnesse , and he was hangid , and ` to-brast the myddil , and alle hise entrailes weren sched abrood .
44001019	And it was maad knowun to alle men that dwelten in Jerusalem , so that the ilke feeld was clepid Acheldemak in the langage of hem , that is , the feeld of blood .
44001020	And it is writun in the book of Salmes , The abitacioun of hem be maad desert , and be ther noon that dwelle in it , and an other take his bishopriche .
44001021	Therfor it bihoueth of these men , that ben gaderid togidere with vs in al the tyme , in which the Lord Jhesu entride , and wente out among vs ,
44001022	and bigan fro the baptym of Joon til in to the dai in which he was takun vp fro vs , that oon of these be maad a witnesse of his resurreccioun with vs .
44001023	And thei ordeyneden tweyn , Joseph , that was clepid Barsabas , that was named Just , and Mathie .
44001024	And thei preieden , and seiden , Thou , Lord , that knowist the hertis of alle men , schewe whom thou hast chosun of these tweyne ,
44001025	that oon take the place of this seruyce and apostlehed , of which Judas trespasside , that he schulde go in to his place .
44001026	And thei yauen lottis to hem , and the lot felde on Mathie ; and he was noumbrid with enleuen apostlis .
44002001	And whanne the daies of Pentecost weren fillid , alle the disciplis weren togidre in the same place .
44002002	And sodeynli ther was maad a sown fro heuene , as of a greet wynde comynge , and it fillide al the hous where thei saten .
44002003	And diuerse tungis as fier apperiden to hem , and it sat on ech of hem .
44002004	And alle weren fillid with the Hooli Goost , and thei bigunnen to speke diuerse langagis , as the Hooli Goost yaf to hem for to speke .
44002005	And ther weren in Jerusalem dwellinge Jewis , religiouse men , of ech nacioun that is vndur heuene .
44002006	And whanne this vois was maad , the multitude cam togidere , and thei weren astonyed in thouyt , for ech man herde hem spekinge in his langage .
44002007	And alle weren astonyed , and wondriden , and seiden togidere , Whether not alle these that speken ben men of Galyle ,
44002008	and hou herden we ech man his langage in which we ben borun ?
44002009	Parthi , and Medi , and Elamyte , and thei that dwellen at Mesopotami , Judee , and Capodosie , and Ponte ,

44002012	And alle weren astonyed , and wondriden , ` and seiden togidere , What wole this thing be ?
44002013	And othere scorneden , and seiden , For these men ben ful of must .
44002014	But Petre stood with the enleuene , and reiside vp his vois , and spak to hem , Ye Jewis , and alle that dwellen at Jerusalem , be this knowun to you , and with eris perseyue ye my wordis .
44002015	For not as ye wenen , these ben dronkun , whanne it is the thridde our of the dai ;
44002016	but this it is , that was seid bi the prophete Johel ,
44002017	And it schal be in the laste daies , the Lord seith , Y schal helde out my spirit on ech fleisch ; and youre sones and youre douytris schulen prophesie , and youre yonge men schulen se visiouns , and youre eldris schulen dreme sweuenes .
44002018	And on my seruauntis and myn handmaidens in tho daies Y schal schede out of my spirit , and thei schulen prophecie .
44002019	And Y schal yyue grete wondris in heuene aboue , and signes in erthe bynethe , blood , and fier , and heete of smoke .
44002020	The sunne schal be turned in to derknessis , and the moone in to blood , bifor that the greet and the opyn dai of the Lord come .
44002021	And it schal be , ech man which euere schal clepe to help the name of the Lord , schal be saaf .
44002022	Ye men of Israel , here ye these wordis . Jhesu of Nazareth , a man preued of God bifor you bi vertues , and wondris , and tokenes , which God dide bi hym in the myddil of you ,
44002023	as ye witen , ye turmentiden , and killiden hym bi the hoondis of wyckid men , bi counseil determyned and bitakun bi the forknouwyng of God .
44002024	Whom God reiside , whanne sorewis of helle weren vnboundun , bi that that it was impossible that he were holdun of it .
44002025	For Dauid seith of hym , Y saiy afer the Lord bifore me euermore , for he is on my riythalf , that Y be not mouyd .
44002026	For this thing myn herte ioiede , and my tunge made ful out ioye , and more ouere my fleisch schal reste in hope .
44002027	For thou schalt not leeue my soule in helle , nethir thou schalt yiue thin hooli to se corrupcioun .
44002028	Thou hast maad knowun to me the weies of lijf , thou schalt fille me in myrthe with thi face .
44002029	Britheren , be it leueful boldli to seie to you of the patriark Dauid , for he is deed and biried , and his sepulcre is among vs in to this dai .
44002030	Therfore whanne he was a prophete , and wiste , that with a greet ooth God hadde sworn to hym , that of the fruyt of his leende schulde oon sitte on his seete ,
44002031	he seynge afer spak of the resurreccioun of Crist , for nether he was left in helle , nether his fleisch saiy corrupcioun .
44002032	God reiside this Jhesu , to whom we alle ben witnessis .
44002033	Therfor he was enhaunsid bi the riythoond of God , and thorouy the biheest of the Hooli Goost that he took of the fadir , he schedde out this spirit , that ye seen and heren .
44002034	For Dauid stiede not in to heuene ; but he seith , The Lord seide to my Lord ,
44002035	Sitte thou on my riyt half , til Y putte thin enemyes a stool of thi feet .
44002036	Therfor moost certeynli wite al the hous of Israel , that God made hym bothe Lord and Crist , this Jhesu , whom ye crucefieden .
44002037	Whanne thei herden these thingis , thei weren compunct in herte ; and thei seiden to Petre and othere apostlis , Britheren , what schulen we do ?
44002038	And Petre seide to hem , Do ye penaunce , and eche of you be baptisid in the name of Jhesu Crist , in to remissioun of youre synnes ; and ye schulen take the yifte of the Hooli Goost .
44002039	For the biheest is to you , and to youre sones , and to alle that ben fer , which euer oure Lord God hath clepid .
44002040	Also with othere wordis ful many he witnesside to hem , and monestide hem , and seide , Be ye sauyd fro this schrewid generacioun .
44002041	Thanne thei that resseyueden his word weren baptisid , and in that dai soulis weren encreesid , aboute thre thousinde ;
44002042	and weren lastynge stabli in the teching of the apostlis , and in comynyng of the breking of breed , in preieris .
44002043	And drede was maad to ech man . And many wondris and signes weren don bi the apostlis in Jerusalem , and greet drede was in alle .
44002044	And alle that bileueden weren togidre , and hadden alle thingis comyn .
44002045	Thei selden possessiouns and catel , and departiden tho thingis to alle men , as it was nede to ech .
44002046	And ech dai thei dwelliden stabli with o wille in the temple , and braken breed aboute housis , and token mete with ful out ioye and symplenesse of herte ,
44002047	and herieden togidere God , and hadden grace to al the folk . And the Lord encreside hem that weren maad saaf , ech dai in to the same thing .
44003001	And Petre and Joon wenten vp in to the temple , at the nynthe our of preiyng .
44003002	And a man that was lame fro the wombe of his modir , was borun , and was leid ech dai at the yate of the temple , that is seid feir , to axe almes of men that entriden in to the temple .
44003003	This , whanne he say Petre and Joon bigynnynge to entre in to the temple , preyede that he schulde take almes .
44003004	And Petre with Joon bihelde on hym , and seide , Biholde thou in to vs .
44003005	And he biheelde in to hem , and hopide , that he schulde take sumwhat of hem .
44003006	But Petre seide , Y haue nether siluer ne gold ; but that that Y haue , Y yiue to thee . In the name of Jhesu Crist of Nazareth , rise thou vp , and go .
44003007	And he took hym bi the riythoond , and heuede hym vp ; and anoon hise leggis and hise feet weren sowdid togidere ;
44003008	and he lippide , and stood , and wandride . And he entride with hem in to the temple , and wandride , and lippide , and heriede God .
44003009	And al the puple sai hym walkinge , and heriynge God .
44003010	And thei knewen hym , that he it was that sat at almes at the feire yate of the temple . And thei weren fillid with wondryng , and stoniynge , in that thing that byfelde to hym .
44003011	But whanne thei sien Petre and Joon , al the puple ran to hem at the porche that was clepid of Salomon , and wondriden greetli .
44003012	And Petre siy , and answeride to the puple , Men of Israel , what wondren ye in this thing ? ether what biholden ye vs , as by oure vertue ethir power we maden this man for to walke ?
44003013	God of Abraham , and God of Ysaac , and God of Jacob , God of oure fadris , hath glorified his sone Jhesu , whom ye bitraieden , and denyeden bifor the face of Pilat , whanne he demede hym to be delyuered .
44003014	But ye denyeden the hooli and the riytful , and axiden a mansleer to be youun to you .
44003015	And ye slowen the maker of lijf , whom God reiside fro deth , of whom we ben witnessis .
44003016	And in the feith of his name he hath confermyd this man , whom ye seen and knowen ; the name of hym , and the feith that is bi him , yaf to this man ful heelthe in the siyt of alle you .
44003017	And now , britheren , Y woot that bi vnwityng ye diden , as also youre princis .
44003018	But God that bifor telde bi the mouth of alle profetis , that his Crist schulde suffre , hath fillid so .
44003019	Therfor be ye repentaunt , and be ye conuertid , that youre synnes be don awei ,
44003020	that whanne the tymes of refresching schulen come from the siyt of the Lord , and he schal sende thilke Jhesu Crist ,
44003021	that is now prechid to you . Whom it bihoueth heuene to resseyue , in to the tymes of restitucioun of alle thingis , which the Lord spak bi the mouth of hise hooli prophetis fro the world .
44003022	For Moises seide , For the Lord youre God schal reise to you a profete , of youre britheren ; as me , ye schulen here hym bi alle thingis , what euer he schal speke to you .
44003023	And it schal be , that euery man that schal not here the ilke profete , schal be distried fro the puple .
44003024	And alle prophetis fro Samuel and aftirward , that spaken , telden these daies .
44003025	But ye ben the sones of prophetis , and of the testament , that God ordeynede to oure fadris , and seide to Abraham , In thi seed alle the meynes of erthe schulen be blessid .
44003026	God reiside his sone first to you , and sente hym blessynge you , that ech man conuerte hym from his wickidnesse .
44004001	And while thei spaken to the puple , the preestis and magistratis of the temple , and the Saduceis camen vpon hem , and soreweden ,
44004002	that thei tauyten the puple , and telden in Jhesu the ayenrisyng fro deth .
44004003	And thei leiden hondis on hem , and puttiden hem in to warde in to the morewe ; for it was thanne euentid .
44004004	But manye of hem that hadden herd the word , bileueden ; and the noumbre of men was maad fyue thousyndis .
44004005	And amorewe it was don , that the princis of hem , and eldre men and scribis weren gadirid in Jerusalem ;
44004006	and Annas , prince of preestis , and Caifas , and Joon , and Alisaundre , and hou manye euere weren of the kynde of preestis .
44004007	And thei settiden hem in the myddil , and axiden , In what vertue , ether in what name , han ye don this thing ?
44004008	Thanne Petre was fillid with the Hooli Goost , and seide to hem , Ye pryncis of the puple , and ye eldre men , here ye .
44004009	If we to dai be demyd in the good dede of a sijk man , in whom this man is maad saaf ,
44004010	be it knowun to you alle , and to al the puple of Israel , that in the name of Jhesu Crist of Nazareth , whom ye crucifieden , whom God reiside fro deth , in this this man stondith hool bifor you .
44004011	This is the stoon , which was repreued of you bildinge , which is maad in to the heed of the corner ;
44004012	and heelthe is not in ony othir . For nether other name vndur heuene is youun to men , in which it bihoueth vs to be maad saaf .
44004013	And thei siyen the stidfastnesse of Petre and of Joon , for it was foundun that thei weren men vnlettrid , and lewid men , and thei wondriden , and knewen hem that thei weren with Jhesu .
44004014	And thei siyen the man that was helid , stondinge with hem , and thei myyten no thing ayenseie .
44004015	But thei comaundiden hem to go forth with out the counsel . And thei spaken togidere ,
44004016	and seiden , What schulen we do to these men ? for the signe is maad knowun bi hem to alle men , that dwellen at Jerusalem ; it is opyn , and we moun not denye .
44004017	But that it be no more pupplischid in to the puple , manasse we to hem , that thei speke no more in this name to ony men .
44004018	And thei clepiden hem , and denounsiden to hem , that on no maner thei schulden speke , nether teche , in the name of Jhesu .
44004019	But Petre and Joon answeriden , and seiden to hem , If it be riytful in the siyt of God to here you rather than God , deme ye .
44004020	For we moten nedis speke tho thingis , that we han sayn and herd .
44004021	And thei manassiden , and leften hem , and foundun not hou thei schulden punische hem , for the puple ; for alle men clarifieden that thing that was don in that that was bifalle .
44004022	For the man was more than of fourty yeer , in which this signe of heelthe was maad .
44004023	And whanne thei weren delyuerid , thei camen to her felowis , and telden to hem , hou grete thingis the princis of preestis and the eldre men hadden seid to hem .
44004024	And whanne thei herden , with oon herte thei reiseden vois to the Lord , and seiden , Lord , thou that madist heuene and erthe , see , and alle thingis that ben in hem , which seidist bi the Hooli Goost ,
44004025	bi the mouth of oure fadir Dauid , thi child , Whi hethen men gnastiden with teeth togidre , and the puplis thouyten veyn thingis ?
44004026	Kyngis of the erthe stoden nyy , and princis camen togidre ` in to oon , ayens the Lord , and ayens his Crist .
44004027	For verili Eroude and Pounce Pilat , with hethene men , and puplis of Israel , camen togidre in this citee ayens thin hooli child Jhesu ,
44004028	whom thou anoyntidist , to do the thingis , that thin hoond and thi counsel demyden to be don .
44004029	And now , Lord , biholde in to the thretnyngis of hem , and graunte to thi seruauntis to speke thi word with al trist ,
44004030	in that thing that thou holde forth thin hond , that heelthis and signes and wondris be maad bi the name of thin hooli sone Jhesu .
44004031	And whanne thei hadden preyed , the place was moued , in which thei weren gaderid ; and alle weren fillid with the Hooli Goost , and spaken the word of God with trist .
44004032	And of al the multitude of men bileuynge was oon herte and oon wille ; nether ony man seide ony thingis of tho thingis that he weldide to be his owne , but alle thingis weren comyn to hem .
44004033	And with greet vertu the apostlis yeldiden witnessyng of the ayenrysyng of Jhesu Crist oure Lord , and greet grace was in alle hem .
44004034	For nether ony nedi man was among hem , for how manye euere weren possessouris of feeldis , ether of housis , thei seelden , and brouyten the pricis of tho thingis that thei seelden ,
44004035	and leiden bifor the feet of the apostlis . And it was departid to ech , as it was nede to ech .
44004036	Forsothe Joseph , that was named Barsabas of apostlis , that is to seie , the sone of coumfort , of the lynage of Leuy ,
44004037	a man of Cipre , whanne he hadde a feeld , seelde it , and brouyte the prijs , and leide it bifor the feet of apostlis .
44005001	But a man , Anany bi name , with Safira , his wijf ,
44005002	seelde a feeld , and defraudide of the prijs of the feeld ; and his wijf was witinge . And he brouyte a part , and leide bifor the feet of the apostlis .
44005003	And Petre seide to hym , Anany , whi hath Sathanas temptid thin herte , that thou lye to the Hooli Goost , and to defraude of the prijs of the feeld ?
44005004	Whethir it vnseld was not thin ; and whanne it was seld , it was in thi power ? Whi hast thou put this thing in thin herte ? Thou hast not lied to men , but to God .
44005005	Anany herde these wordis , and felde doun , and was deed . And greet drede was maad on alle that herden .
44005006	And yonge men risen , and mouyden hym awei , and baren hym out , and birieden .
44005007	And ther was maad as a space of thre ouris , and his wijf knewe not that thing that was don , and entride .
44005008	And Petre answerde to hir , Womman , seie to me , whether ye seelden the feeld for so mych ? And sche seide , Yhe , for so mych .
44005009	And Petre seide to hyr , What bifelde to you , to tempte the spirit of the Lord ? Lo ! the feet of hem that han birieden thin hosebonde ben at the dore , and thei schulen bere thee out .
44005010	Anoon sche felde doun at hise feet , and diede . And the yonge men entriden , and founden hir deed , and thei baren hir out , and birieden to hir hosebonde .
44005011	And greet drede was maad in al the chirche , and in to alle that herden these thingis .
44005012	And bi the hoondis of the apostlis signes and many wondris weren maad in the puple . And alle weren of oon acord in the porche of Salomon .
44005013	But no man of othere durste ioyne hymsilf with hem , but the puple magnyfiede hem .
44005014	And the multitude of men and of wymmen bileuynge in the Lord was more encreessid ,
44005015	so that thei brouyten out sike men in to stretis , and leiden in litle beddis and couchis , that whanne Petre cam , nameli the schadew of hym schulde schadewe ech of hem , and thei schulden be delyuerid fro her syknessis .
44005016	And the multitude of citees niy to Jerusalem ran , bryngynge sijk men , and that weren trauelid of vnclene spiritis , whiche alle weren heelid .
44005017	But the prince of preestis roos vp , and alle that weren with hym , that is the eresye of Saduceis , and weren fillid with enuye ;
44005018	and leiden hondis on the apostlis , and puttiden hem in the comyn warde .
44005019	But the aungel of the Lord openyde bi nyyt the yatis of the prisoun , and ledde hem out , and seide , Go ye ,
44005020	and stonde ye , and speke in the temple to the puple alle the wordis of this lijf .
44005021	Whom whanne thei hadden herd , thei entriden eerli in to the temple , and tauyten . And the prince of preestis cam , and thei that weren with him , and clepiden togidre the counsel , and alle the eldre men of the children of Israel ; and senten to the prisoun , that thei schulden be brouyt forth .
44005022	And whanne the mynystris camen , founden hem not , and for the prisoun was openyd , thei turneden ayen ,
44005023	and teelden , and seiden , We founden the prisoun schit with al diligence , and the keperis stondynge at the yatis ; but we opneden , and founden no man ther ynne .
44005024	And as the maiestratis of the temple , and the princis of preestis herden these wordis , thei doutiden of hem , what was don .
44005025	But a man cam , and teelde to hem , For lo ! tho men whiche ye han put in to prisoun , ben in the temple , and stonden , and techen the puple .
44005026	Thanne the magistrat wente with the mynystris , and brouyte hem with out violence ; for thei dredden the puple , lest thei schulden be stonyd .
44005027	And whanne thei hadden brouyt hem , thei settiden hem in the counsel ; and the princes of prestis axiden hem ,
44005028	and seiden , In comaundement we comaundiden you , that ye schulden not teche in this name , and lo ! ye han fillid Jerusalem with youre teching , and ye wolen bringe on vs the blood of this man .
44005029	And Petre answeride , and the apostlis , and seiden , It bihoueth to obeie to God , more than to men .
44005030	God of oure fadris reiside Jhesu , whom ye slowen , hangynge in a tre .
44005031	God enhaunside with his riythond this prince and sauyour , that penaunce were yyue to Israel , and remyssioun of synnes .
44005032	And we ben witnessis of these wordis , and the Hooli Goost , whom God yaf to alle obeischinge to him .
44005033	Whanne thei herden these thingis , thei weren turmentid , and thouyten to sle hem .
44005034	But a man roos in the counsel , a Farise , Gamaliel bi name , a doctour of the lawe , a worschipful man to al the puple , and comaundide the men to be put without forth for a while .
44005035	And he seide to hem , Ye men of Israel , take tent to you silf on these men , what ye schulen do .
44005036	For bifore these daies Teodas , that seide hym silf to be sum man , to whom a noumbre of men consentiden , aboute foure hundrid ; which was slayn , and alle that bileueden to hym , weren disparplit , and brouyt to nouyt .
44005037	Aftir this , Judas of Galilee was in the daies of professioun , and turnyde awei the puple aftir hym ; and alle hou manye euere consentiden to hym , weren scatered , and he perischide .
44005038	And now therfor Y seie to you , departe ye fro these men , and suffre ye hem ; for if this counsel ether werk is of men , it schal be vndon ;
44005039	but if it is of God , ye moun not vndo hem , lest perauenture ye be foundun to repugne God .
44005040	And thei consentiden to him ; and thei clepiden togidere the apostlis , and denounsiden to hem , that weren betun , that thei schulden no more speke in the name of Jhesu , and thei leten hem go .
44005041	And thei wenten ioiynge fro the siyt of the counsel , that thei weren had worthi to suffre dispisyng for the name of Jhesu .
44005042	But ech dai thei ceessiden not in the temple , and aboute housis , to teche and to preche Jhesu Crist .
44006001	But in tho daies , whanne the noumbre of disciplis encreesside , the Grekis grutchiden ayens the Ebrews , for that her widewis weren dispisid in euery daies mynystryng .
44006002	And the twelue clepiden togidere the multitude of disciplis , and seiden , It is not ryytful , that we leeuen the word of God , and mynystren to boordis .
44006003	Therfor , britheren , biholde ye men of you of good fame , ful of the Hooli Goost and of wisdom , whiche we schulen ordeyne on this werk ;
44006004	for we schulen be bisi to preier , and preche the word of God .
44006005	And the word pleside bifor al the multitude ; and thei chesiden Styuen , a man ful of feith and of the Hooli Goost , and Filip , and Procore , and Nycanor , and Tymon , and Parmanam , and Nycol , a comelyng , a man of Antioche .
44006006	Thei ordeyneden these bifor the siyt of apostlis , and thei preyeden , and leiden hoondis on hem .
44006007	And the word of the Lord wexide , and the noumbre of the disciplis in Jerusalem was myche multiplied ; also myche cumpany of preestis obeiede to the feith .
44006008	And Steuen , ful of grace and of strengthe , made wondris and grete signes in the puple .
44006009	But summe rysen of the synagoge , that was clepid of Libertyns , and Cirenensis , and of men of Alisaundre , and of hem that weren of Cilice and of Asie , and disputiden with Steuene .
44006010	And thei miyten not withstonde the wisdom and the spirit , that spak .
44006011	Thanne thei priueli senten men , that schulden seie , that thei herden hym seiynge wordis of blasfemye ayens Moises and God .
44006012	And so thei moueden togidere the puple , and the eldre men , and the scribis ; and thei rannen togidre , and token hym , and brouyten in to the counsel .
44006013	And thei ordeyneden false witnessis , that seiden , This man ceessith not to speke wordis ayens the hooli place , and the lawe .
44006014	For we herden hym seiynge , That this Jhesus of Nazareth schal destrye this place , and schal chaunge the tradiciouns , whiche Moyses bitook to us .
44006015	And alle men that seten in the counsel bihelden hym , and sayn his face as the face of an aungel .
44007001	And the prynce of prestis seide to Steuene , Whethir these thingis han hem so ?
44007002	Which seide , Britheren and fadris , here ye . God of glorie apperide to oure fadir Abraham , whanne he was in Mesopotamie , bifor that he dwelte in Carram , and seide to hym ,
44007003	Go out of thi loond , and of thi kynrede , and come in to the loond , which Y schal schewe to thee .
44007004	Thanne he wente out of the loond of Caldeis , and dwelte in Carram . And fro thens aftir that his fader was deed , he translatide him in to this loond , in which ye dwellen now .
44007005	And he yaf not to hym eritage in it , nethir a paas of a foot , but he bihiyte to yyue hym it in to possessioun , and to his seed aftir hym , whanne he hadde not a sone .
44007006	And God spak to hym , That his seed schal be comling in an alien lond , and thei schulen make hem suget to seruage , and schulen yuel trete hem , foure hundrid yeris and thritti ;
44007007	and Y schal iuge the folk , to which thei schulen serue , seith the Lord . And after these thingis thei schulen go out , and thei schulen serue to me in this place .
44007008	And he yaf to hym the testament of circumcisioun ; and so he gendride Ysaac , and circumcidide hym in the eiyt dai . And Isaac gendride Jacob , and Jacob gendride the twelue patriarkis .
44007009	And the patriarkis hadden enuye to Joseph , and selden hym in to Egipt .
44007010	And God was with hym , and delyuerede hym of alle hise tribulaciouns , and yaf to hym grace and wisdom in the siyt of Farao , king of Egipt . And he ordeynede hym souereyn on Egipt , and on al his hous .
44007011	And hungur cam in to al Egipt , and Canaan , and greet tribulacioun ; and oure fadris founden not mete .
44007012	But whanne Jacob hadde herd , that whete was in Egipt , he sente oure fadris first .
44007013	And in the secounde tyme Joseph was knowun of hise britheren , and his kyn was maad knowun to Farao .
44007014	And Joseph sente , and clepide Jacob , his fadir , and al his kynrede , seuenti and fyue men .
44007015	And Jacob cam doun in to Egipt , and was deed , he and oure fadris ;
44007016	and thei weren translatid in to Sichen , and weren leid in the sepulcre , that Abraham bouyte bi prijs of siluer of the sones of Emor , the sone of Sichen .
44007017	And whanne the tyme of biheeste cam niy , which God hadde knoulechid to Abraham , the puple waxede , and multipliede in Egipt ,
44007018	til another kyng roos in Egipt , which knewe not Joseph .
44007019	This bigilide oure kyn , and turmentide oure fadris , that thei schulden putte awey her yonge children , for thei schulden not lyue .
44007020	In the same tyme Moyses was borun , and he was louyd of God ; and he was norischid thre monethis in the hous of his fadir .
44007021	And whanne he was put out in the flood , the douyter of Farao took hym vp , and nurischide hym in to hir sone .
44007022	And Moises was lerned in al the wisdom of Egipcians , and he was myyti in his wordis and werkis .
44007023	But whanne the tyme of fourti yeer was fillid to hym , it roos vp ` in to his herte , that he schulde visite hise britheren , the sones of Israel .
44007024	And whanne he say a man suffringe wronge , he vengide hym , and dide veniaunce for hym that suffride the wronge , and he killide the Egipcian .
44007025	For he gesside that his britheren schulden vndurstonde , that God schulde yyue to hem helthe bi the hoond of hym ; but thei vndurstoden not .
44007026	For in the dai suynge he apperide to hem chidinge , and he acordide hem in pees , and seide , Men , ye ben britheren ; whi noyen ye ech othere ?
44007027	But he that dide the wronge to his neiybore , puttide hym awey , and seide , Who ordeynede thee prince and domesman on vs ?
44007028	Whethir thou wolt sle me , as yistirdai thou killidist the Egipcian ?
44007029	And in this word Moises flei , and was maad a comeling in the loond of Madian , where he bigat twei sones .
44007030	And whanne he hadde fillid fourti yeer , an aungel apperide to hym in fier of flawme of a buysch , in desert of the mount of Syna .
44007031	And Moises siy , and wondride on the siyt . And whanne he neiyede to biholde , the vois of the Lord was maad to hym ,
44007032	and seide , Y am God of youre fadris , God of Abraham , God of Ysaac , God of Jacob . Moises was maad tremblynge , and durste not biholde .
44007033	But God seide to hym , Do of the schoon of thi feet , for the place in which thou stondist is hooli erthe .
44007034	Y seynge say the turmentyng of my puple that is in Egipt , and Y herde the mornyng of hem , and Y cam doun to delyuere hem . And now come thou , and Y schal sende thee in to Egipt .
44007035	This Moises whom thei denyeden , seiynge , Who ordeynede thee prince and domesman on vs ? God sente this prince and ayenbiere , with the hoond of the aungel , that apperide to hym in the busch .
44007036	This Moises ledde hem out , and dide wondris and signes in the loond of Egipt , and in the reed see , and in desert fourti yeeris .
44007037	This is Moises , that seide to the sones of Israel , God schal reise to you a profete of youre bretheren , as me ye schulen here him .
44007038	This it is , that was in the chirche in wildirnesse , with the aungel that spak to hym in the mount of Syna , and with oure fadris ; which took words of lijf to yyue to vs .
44007039	To whom oure fadris wolden not obeie , but puttiden hym awei , and weren turned awei in hertis in to Egipt ,
44007040	seiynge to Aaron , Make thou to vs goddis , that schulen go bifore vs ; for to this Moyses that ledde vs out of the lond of Egipt , we witen not what is don to hym .
44007041	And thei maden a calf in tho daies , and offriden a sacrifice to the mawmet ; and thei weren glad in the werkis of her hondis .
44007042	And God turnede , and bitook hem to serue to the knyythod of heuene , as it is writun in the book of profetis , Whether ye , hous of Israel , offriden to me slayn sacrificis , ether sacrificis , fourti yeris in desert ?
44007043	And ye han take the tabernacle of Moloc , and the sterre of youre god Renfam , figuris that ye han maad to worschipe hem ; and Y schal translate you in to Babiloyn .
44007044	The tabernacle of witnessing was with oure fadris in desert , as God disposide to hem , and spak to Moyses , that he schulde make it aftir the fourme that he say .
44007045	Which also oure fadris token with Jhesu , and brouyten in to the possessioun of hethene men , whiche God puttide awey fro the face of oure fadris , til in to the daies of Dauid ,
44007046	that fonde grace anentis God , and axide that he schulde fynde a tabernacle to God of Jacob .
44007047	But Salomon bildide the hous ` to hym .
44007048	But the hiy God dwellith not in thingis maad bi hoond ,
44007049	as he seith bi the profete , Heuene is a seete to me , and the erthe is the stool of my feet ; what hous schulen ye bilde to me , seith the Lord , ether what place is of my restyng ?
44007050	Whether myn hoond made not alle these thingis ?
44007051	With hard nol , and vncircumcidid hertis and eris ye withstoden eueremore the Hooli Goost ; and as youre fadris , so ye .
44007052	Whom of the profetis han not youre fadris pursued , and han slayn hem that bifor telden of the comyng of the riytful man , whos traitouris and mansleeris ye weren now ?
44007053	Whiche token the lawe in ordynaunce of aungels , and han not kept it .
44007054	And thei herden these thingis , and weren dyuersli turmentid in her hertis , and grenneden with teeth on hym .
44007055	But whanne Steuene was ful of the Hooli Goost , he bihelde in to heuene , and say the glorie of God , and Jhesu stondinge on the riythalf of the vertu of God .
44007056	And he seide , Lo ! Y se heuenes openyd , and mannus sone stondynge on the riythalf of the vertu of God .
44007057	And thei crieden with a greet vois , and stoppiden her eris , and maden with o wille an assauyt in to hym .
44007058	And thei brouyten hym out of the citee , and stonyden . And the witnessis diden of her clothis , bisidis the feet of a yong man , that was clepid Saule .
44007059	And thei stonyden Steuene , that clepide God to help , seiynge , Lord Jhesu , resseyue my spirit .
44007060	And he knelide , and criede with a greet vois , and seide , Lord , sette not to hem this synne . And whanne he hadde seid this thing , he diede .	
44008001	But Saul was consentynge to his deth . And greet persecucioun was maad that dai in the chirche , that was in Jerusalem . And alle men weren scatered bi the cuntrees of Judee and Samarie , outakun the apostlis .
44008002	But good men birieden Steuene , and maden greet mornyng on hym .
44008003	But Saul greetli distruyede the chirche , and entryde bi housis , and drowe men and wymmen , and bitook hem in to prisoun .
44008004	And thei that weren scaterid , passiden forth , prechynge the word of God .
44008005	And Filip cam doun in to a citee of Samarie , and prechide to hem Crist .
44008006	And the puple yaf tent to thes thingis that weren seid of Filip , with o wille herynge and seynge the signes that he dide .
44008007	For manye of hem that hadden vnclene spirits , crieden with a greet vois , and wenten out .
44008008	And manye sijk in the palsi , and crokid , weren heelid .
44008009	Therfor greet ioye was maad in that citee . But there was a man in that citee , whos name was Symount , a witche , that hadde disseyued the folc of Samarie , seiynge , that him silf was sum greet man .
44008010	Whom alle herkeneden , fro the leest to the moost , and seiden , This is the vertu of God , which is clepid greet .
44008011	And thei leueden hym , for long tyme he hadde maddid hem with his witche craftis .
44008012	But whanne thei hadden bileued to Filip , ` that prechide of the kingdom of God , men and wymmen weren baptisid in the name of Jhesu Crist .
44008013	And thanne also Symount him silf bileued ; and whanne he was baptisid , he drouy to Filip ; and he sai also that signes and grete vertues weren don , he was astonyed , and wondride .
44008014	But whanne the apostlis that weren at Jerusalem , hadden herd that Samarie hadde resseyued the word of God , thei senten to hem Petre and Joon .
44008015	And whanne thei camen , thei preieden for hem , that thei schulden resseyue the Hooli Goost ;
44008016	for he cam not yit in to ony of hem , but thei weren baptisid oonli in the name of the Lord Jhesu .
44008017	Thanne thei leiden hoondis on hem , and thei resseyueden the Hooli Goost .
44008018	And whanne Symount hadde seyn , that the Hooly Goost was youun bi leiyng on of the hoondis of the apostlis , and he proferide to hem money , and seide ,
44008019	Yyue ye also to me this power , that whom euere Y schal leye on myn hoondis , that he resseyue the Hooli Goost .
44008020	But Petir seide to hym , Thi money be with thee into perdicioun , for thou gessidist the yifte of God schulde be had for monei .
44008021	Ther is no part , ne sort to thee , in this word , for thin herte is not riytful bifor God .
44008022	Therfor do thou penaunce for this wickidnesse of thee , and preie God , if perauenture this thouyt of thin herte be foryouun to thee .
44008023	For Y se that thou art in the gall of bitternesse and in the boond of wickidnesse .
44008024	And Symount answeride , and seide , Preie ye for me to the Lord , that no thing of these thingis that ye han seid , com on me .
44008025	And thei witnessiden , and spaken the word of the Lord , and yeden ayen to Jerusalem , and prechiden to many cuntrees of Samaritans .
44008026	And an aungel of the Lord spak to Filip , and seide , Ryse thou , and go ayens the south , to the weie that goith doun fro Jerusalem in to Gasa ; this is desert .
44008027	And he roos , and wente forth . And lo ! a man of Ethiopie , a myyti man seruaunt , a yelding of Candace , the queen of Ethiopiens , which was on alle her richessis , cam to worschipe in Jerusalem .
44008028	And he turnede ayen , sittinge on his chare , and redinge Isaie , the profete .
44008029	And the spirit seide to Filip , Neiye thou , and ioyne thee to this chare .
44008030	And Filip ` ran to , and herde hym redynge Ysaie , the prophete . And he seide , Gessist thou , whether thou vndirstondist , what thingis thou redist ?
44008031	And he seide , How may Y , if no man schewe to me ? And he preiede Filip , that he schulde come vp , and sitte with hym .
44008032	And the place of the scripture that he redde , was this , As a scheep he was led to sleyng , and as a lomb bifor a man that scherith him is doumb with out vois , so he openyde not his mouth .
44008033	In mekenesse his dom was takun vp ; who schal telle out the generacioun of hym ? For his lijf schal be takun awei fro the erthe .
44008034	And the gelding answeride to Filip , and seide , Y biseche thee , of ` what profete seith he this thing ? of him silf , ethir of ony othere ?
44008035	And Filip openyde his mouth , and bigan at this scripture , and prechide to him Jhesu .
44008036	And the while thei wenten bi the weie , thei camen to a water . And the gelding seide , Lo ! watir ; who forbedith me to be baptisid ?
44008037	And Filip seide , If thou bileuest of al the herte , it is leueful . And he answeride , and seide , Y bileue that Jhesu Crist is the sone of God .
44008038	And he comaundide the chare to stonde stille . And thei wenten doun bothe into the watir , Filip and the gelding , and Filip baptiside hym .
44008039	And whanne thei weren come vp of the watir , the spirit of the Lord rauyschide Filip , and the gelding say hym no more .
44008040	And Filip was foundun in Azotus ; and he passide forth , and prechide to alle citees , til he cam to Cesarie .
44009001	But Saul , yit a blower of manassis and of betingis ayens the disciplis of the Lord ,
44009002	cam to the prince of preestis , and axide of hym lettris in to Damask , to the synagogis ; that if he fond ony men and wymmen of this lijf , he schulde lede hem boundun to Jerusalem .
44009003	And whanne he made his iourney , it bifelde , that he cam nyy to Damask . And sudenli a liyt from heuene schoon aboute hym ;
44009004	and he fallide to the erthe , and herde a vois seiynge to hym , Saul , Saul , what pursuest thou me ?
44009005	And he seide , Who art thou , Lord ? And he seide , Y am Jhesu of Nazareth , whom thou pursuest . It is hard to thee , to kike ayens the pricke .
44009006	And he tremblide , and wondride , and seide , Lord , what wolt thou that Y do ?
44009007	And the Lord seide to hym , Rise vp , and entre in to the citee , and it schal be seide to thee , what it bihoueth thee to do . And tho men that wenten with hym , stoden astonyed ; for thei herden a vois , but thei sien no man .
44009008	And Saul roos fro the earth ; and whanne hise iyen weren opened , he say no thing . And thei drowen hym bi the hondis , and ledden hym in to Damask .
44009009	And he was thre daies not seynge ; ` and he eete not , nether drank .
44009010	And a disciple , Ananye bi name , was at Damask . And the Lord seide to hym in ` a visioun , Ananye . And he seide , Lo !
44009011	Y , Lord . And the Lord seide to hym , Rise thou , and go in to a streete that is clepid Rectus ; and seke , in the hous of Judas , Saul bi name of Tharse . For lo ! he preieth ; and he say a man ,
44009012	Ananye bi name , entringe and leiynge on hym hoondis , that he resseyue siyt .
44009013	And Ananye answerde , Lord , Y haue herd of many of this man , how greete yuelis he dide to thi seyntis in Jerusalem ;
44009014	and this hath power of the princis of preestis , to bynde alle men that clepen thi name to helpe .
44009015	And the Lord seide to hym , Go thou , for this is to me a vessel of chesing , that he bere my name bifore hethene men , and kingis , and tofore the sones of Israel .
44009016	For Y schal schewe to hym , how grete thingis it bihoueth hym to suffre for my name .
44009017	And Ananye wente , and entride in to the hous ; and leide on hym his hondis , and seide , Saul brothir , the Lord Jhesu sente me , that apperide to thee in the weie , in which thou camest , that thou se , and be fulfillid with the Hooli Goost .
44009018	And anoon as the scalis felden fro hise iyen , he resseyuede siyt . And he roos , and was baptisid .
44009019	And whanne he hadde takun mete , he was coumfortid . And he was bi sum daies with the disciplis , that weren at Damask .
44009020	And anoon he entride in to the synagogis , and prechide the Lord Jhesu , for this is the sone of God .
44009021	And alle men that herden hym , wondriden , and seiden , Whether this is not he that impugnede in Jerusalem hem that clepiden to help this name ? and hidir he cam for this thing , that he schulde leede hem boundun to the princis of preestis ?
44009022	But Saul myche more wexede strong , and confoundide the Jewis that dwelliden at Damask , and affermyde that this is Crist .
44009023	And whanne manye daies weren fillid , Jewis maden a counsel , that thei schulden sle hym .
44009024	And the aspies of hem weren maad knowun to Saul . And thei kepten the yatis dai and niyt , that thei schulden sle him .
44009025	But hise disciplis token hym bi nyyt , and delyuereden hym , and leeten him doun in a leep bi the wal .
44009026	And whanne he cam in to Jerusalem , he assaiede to ioyne hym to the disciplis ; and alle dredden hym , and leueden not that he was a disciple .
44009027	But Barnabas took , and ledde hym to the apostlis , and telde to hem , how in the weie he hadde seyn the Lord , and that he spak to hym , and hou in Damask he dide tristili in the name of Jhesu .
44009028	And he was with hem , and entride , and yede out in Jerusalem , and dide tristili in the name of Jhesu .
44009029	And he spak with hethene men , and disputide with Grekis . And thei souyten to sle hym .
44009030	Which thing whanne the britheren hadden knowe , thei ledden hym bi nyyt to Cesarie , and leten hym go to Tarsis .
44009031	And the chirche bi al Judee , and Galilee , and Samarie , hadde pees , and was edefied , and walkide in the drede of the Lord , and was fillid with coumfort of the Hooli Goost .
44009032	And it bifelde , that Petre , the while he passide aboute alle , cam to the hooli men that dwelliden at Lidde .
44009033	And he foond a man , Eneas bi name , that fro eiyte yeer he hadde leie ` in bed ; and he was sijk in palsy .
44009034	And Petre seide to hym , Eneas , the Lord Jhesu Crist heele thee ; rise thou , and araye thee . And anoon he roos .
44009035	And alle men that dwelten at Lidde , and at Sarone , saien hym , whiche weren conuertid to the Lord .
44009036	And in Joppe was a disciplesse , whos name was Tabita , that is to seie , Dorcas . This was ful of good werkis and almesdedis , that sche dide .
44009037	And it bifelde in tho daies , that sche was sijk , and diede . And whanne thei hadden waischun hir , thei leiden hir in a soler .

44009039	And Petre roos vp , and cam with hem . And whanne he was comun , thei ledden hym in to the soler . And alle widewis stoden aboute hym , wepynge , and schewynge cootis and clothis , which Dorcas made to hem .
44009040	And whanne alle men weren put with out forth , Petre knelide , and preiede . And he turnede to the bodi , and seide , Tabita , rise thou . And sche openyde hir iyen , and whanne sche siy Petre , sche sat vp ayen .
44009041	And he took hir bi the hond , and reiside hir . And whanne he hadde clepid the hooli men and widewis , he assignede hir alyue .
44009042	And it was maad knowun bi al Joppe ; and many bileueden in the Lord .
44009043	And it was maad , that many daies he dwellide in Joppe , at oon Symount , a curiour .
44010001	A man was in Cesarie , Cornelie bi name , a centurien of the cumpanye of knyytis , that is seid of Italie ;

44010005	And now sende thou men in to Joppe , and clepe oon Symount , that is named Petre .
44010006	This is herborid at a man Symount , curiour , whos hous is bisidis the see . This schal seie to thee , what it bihoueth thee to do .
44010007	And whanne the aungel that spak to hym , was gon awei , he clepide twei men of his hous , and a knyyt that dredde the Lord , whiche weren at his bidding .
44010008	And whanne he hadde told hem alle these thingis , he sente hem in to Joppe .
44010009	And on the dai suynge , while thei maden iournei , and neiyeden to the citee , Petre wente vp in to the hiest place of the hous to preie , aboute the sixte our .

44010019	And while Petre thouyte on the visioun , the spirit seide to hym , Lo ! thre men seken thee .
44010020	Therfor ryse thou , and go doun , and go with hem , and doute thou no thing , for Y sente hem .
44010021	And Petre cam doun to the men , and seide , Lo ! Y am , whom ye seken ; what is the cause , for which ye ben come ?

44010026	But Petre reiside hym , and seide , Aryse thou , also Y my silf am a man , as thou .
44010027	And he spak with hym , and wente in , and foonde many that weren come togidere .
44010028	And he seide to hem , Ye witen , how abhomynable it is to a Jewe , to be ioyned ether to come to an alien ; but God schewide to me , that no man seye a man comyn , ethir vnclene .

44010032	Therfor sende thou in to Joppe , and clepe Symount , that is named Petre ; this is herborid in the hous of Symount coriour , bisidis the see . This , whanne he schal come , schal speke to thee .
44010033	Therfor anoon Y sente to thee , and thou didist wel in comynge to vs . ` Now therfor we alle ben present in thi siyt , to here the wordis , what euer ben comaundid to thee of the Lord .
44010034	And Petre openyde his mouth , and seide , In trewthe Y haue foundun , that God is no acceptor of persoones ;
44010035	but in eche folk he that dredith God , and worchith riytwisnesse , is accept to hym .
44010036	God sente a word to the children of Israel , schewinge pees bi Jhesu Crist ; this is Lord of alle thingis .
44010037	Ye witen the word that is maad thorou al Judee , and bigan at Galile , aftir the baptym that Joon prechide , Jhesu of Nazareth ;
44010038	hou God anoyntide hym with the Hooli Goost , and vertu ; which passide forth in doynge wel , and heelynge alle men oppressid of the deuel , for God was with hym .
44010039	And we ben witnessis of alle thingis , whiche he dide in the cuntrei of Jewis , and of Jerusalem ; whom thei slowen , hangynge in a tre .
44010040	And God reiside this in the thridde dai , and yaf hym to be maad knowun ,
44010041	not to al puple , but to witnessis bifor ordeyned of God ; to vs that eeten and drunken with hym , after that he roos ayen fro deth .
44010042	And he comaundide to vs to preche to the puple , and to witnesse , that he it is , that is ordeyned of God domesman of the quyk and of deede .
44010043	To this alle prophetis beren witnessing , that alle men that bileuen in hym , schulen resseyue remyssioun of synnes bi his name .
44010044	And yit while that Petre spak these wordis , the Hooli Goost felde on alle that herden the word .
44010045	And the feithful men of circumcisioun , that camen with Petre , wondriden , that also in to naciouns the grace of the Hooli Goost is sched out .
44010046	For thei herden hem spekynge in langagis , and magnyfiynge God .
44010047	Thanne Petre answeride , Whether ony man may forbede watir , that these ben not baptisid , that han also resseyued the Hooli Goost as we ?
44010048	And he comaundide hem to be baptisid in the name of the Lord Jhesu Crist . Thanne thei preieden hym , that he schulde dwelle with hem sum daies .
44011001	And the apostlis , and the britheren that weren in Judee , herden that also hethene men resseyueden the word of God , and thei glorifieden God .
44011002	But whanne Petre cam to Jerusalem , thei that weren of circumcisioun , disputiden ayens hym ,
44011003	and seiden , Whi entridist thou to men that han prepucie , and hast eete with hem ?
44011004	And Petre bigan , and expownede to hem bi ordre ,
44011005	and seide , Y was in the citee of Joppe , and preiede , and Y sai in rauysching of my mynde a visioun , that a vessel cam doun , as a greet scheete with foure coordis , and was sent doun fro heuene ; and it cam to me .
44011006	In to which Y lokinge biheld , and sai foure footid beestis of the erthe , and beestis , and crepynge beestis , and volatils of heuene .
44011007	And Y herde also a vois that seide to me , Petre , rise thou , and sle , and eete .
44011008	But Y seide , Nay , Lord ; for comyn thing ether vnclene entride neuer in to my mouth .
44011009	And the vois answeride the secounde tyme fro heuene , That thing that God hath clensid , seie thou not vnclene .
44011010	And this was don bi thries , and alle thingis weren resseyued ayen in to heuene .
44011011	And lo ! thre men anoon stooden in the hous , in which Y was ; and thei weren sent fro Cesarie to me .
44011012	And the spirit seide to me , that Y schulde go with hem , and doute no thing . Yhe , and these sixe britheren camen with me , and we entriden in to the hous of the man .
44011013	And he telde to vs , how he say an aungel in his hous , stondinge and seiynge to hym , Sende thou in to Joppe , and clepe Symount , that is named Petre , which schal speke to thee wordis ,

44011015	And whanne Y hadde bigunnun to speke , the Hooli Goost felle on hem , as in to vs in the bigynnyng .
44011016	And Y bithouyte on the word of the Lord , as he seide , For Joon baptiside in watir , but ye schulen be baptisid in the Hooli Goost .
44011017	Therfor if God yaf to hem the same grace , as to vs that bileueden in the Lord Jhesu Crist , who was Y , that myyte forbeede the Lord , that he yyue not the Hooli Goost to hem that bileueden in the name of Jhesu Crist ?
44011018	Whanne these thingis weren herd , thei helden pees , and glorifieden God , and seiden , Therfor also to hethene men God hath youun penaunce to lijf .
44011019	And thei that weren scaterid of the tribulacioun that was maad vndir Steuene , walkiden forth to Fenyce , and to Cipre , and to Antioche , and spaken the word to no man , but to Jewis aloone .
44011020	But sum of hem weren men of Cipre , and of Cirenen ; whiche whanne thei hadden entride in to Antioche , thei spaken to the Grekis , and prechiden the Lord Jhesu .
44011021	And the hond of the Lord was with hem , and myche noumbre of men bileuynge was conuertid to the Lord .
44011022	And the word cam to the eris of the chirche , that was at Jerusalem , on these thingis ; and thei senten Barnabas to Antioche .
44011023	And whanne he was come , and siy the grace of the Lord , he ioyede , and monestide alle men to dwelle in the Lord in purpos of herte ;
44011024	for he was a good man , and ful of the Hooli Goost , and of feith . And myche puple was encresid to the Lord .
44011025	And he wente forth to Tharsis , to seke Saul ; and whanne he hadde foundun hym , he ledde to Antioche .
44011026	And al a yeer thei lyueden ther in the chirche , and tauyten myche puple , so that the disciplis weren namyd first at Antioche cristen men .
44011027	And in these daies profetis camen ouer fro Jerusalem to Antioche .
44011028	And oon of hem roos vp , Agabus bi name , and signefiede bi the spirit a greet hungur to comynge in al the world , which hungur was maad vndur Claudius .
44011029	And alle the disciplis purposiden , after that ech hadde , for to sende in to mynysterie to britheren that dwelliden in Judee .
44011030	Which thing also thei diden , and sente it to the eldre men , bi the hoondis of Barnabas and Saul .
44012001	And in the same tyme Eroude the king sente power , to turmente sum men of the chirche .
44012002	And he slowe bi swerd James , the brothir of Joon .
44012003	And he siy that it pleside to Jewis , and keste to take also Petre ; and the daies of therf looues weren .
44012004	And whanne he hadde cauyte Petre , he sente hym in to prisoun ; and bitook to foure quaternyouns of knyytis , to kepe hym , and wolde aftir pask bringe hym forth to the puple .
44012005	And Petre was kept in prisoun ; but preier was maad of the chirche with out ceessing to God for hym .
44012006	But whanne Eroude schulde bringe hym forth , in that nyyt Petre was slepinge bitwixe twei knyytis , and was boundun with twei cheynes ; and the keperis bifor the dore kepten the prisoun .

44012008	And the aungel seide to hym , Girde thee , and do on thin hoosis . And he dide so . And he seide to hym , Do aboute thee thi clothis , and sue me .
44012009	And he yede out , and suede hym ; and he wiste not that it was soth , that was don bi the aungel ; for he gesside hym silf to haue sey a visioun .
44012010	And thei passiden the first and the secounde warde , and camen to the iren yate that ledith to the citee , which anoon was opened to hem . And thei yeden out , and camen in to o street , and anoon the aungel passide awei fro hym .
44012011	And Petre turnede ayen to hym silf , and seide , Now Y woot verili , that the Lord sente his aungel , ` and delyueride me fro the hoond of Eroude , and fro al the abiding of the puple of Jewis .
44012012	And he bihelde , and cam to the hous of Marie , modir of Joon , that is named Marcus , where many weren gaderid togidre , and preiynge .
44012013	And whanne he knockid at the dore of the yate , a damysel , Rode bi name , cam forth to se .
44012014	And whanne sche knewe the vois of Petre , for ioye sche openyde not the yate , but ran in , and telde , that Petre stood at the yate .
44012015	And thei seiden ` to hir , Thou maddist . But sche affermyde , that it was so . And thei seiden , It is his aungel .
44012016	But Petre abood stille , and knockide . And whanne thei hadden opened the dore , thei sayen hym , and wondriden .
44012017	And he bekenyde to hem with his hoond to be stille , and telde hou the Lord hadde led hym out of the prisoun . And he seide , Telle ye to James and to the britheren these thingis . And he yede out , and wente in to an othere place .
44012018	And whanne the dai was come , ther was not lytil troubling among the knyytis , what was don of Petre .
44012019	And whanne Eroude hadde souyt hym , and foonde not , aftir that he hadde made enqueryng of the keperis , he comaundide hem to be brouyt to hym . And he cam doun fro Judee in to Cesarie , and dwellide there .
44012020	And he was wroth to men of Tyre and of Sidon . And thei of oon acord camen to hym , whanne thei hadden counseilid with Bastus , that was the kingis chaumbirleyn , thei axiden pees , for as myche that her cuntrees weren vitailid of hym .
44012021	And in a dai that was ordeyned , Eroude was clothid with kyngis clothing , and sat for domesman , and spak to hem .
44012022	And the puple criede , The voicis of God , and not of man .
44012023	And anoon an aungel of the Lord smoot hym , for he hadde not youun onour to God ; and he was wastid of wormes , and diede .
44012024	And the word of the Lord waxide , and was multiplied .
44012025	And Barnabas and Saul turneden ayen fro Jerusalem , whanne the mynystrie was fillid , and token Joon , that was named Marcus .
44013001	And profetis and doctouris weren in the chirche that was at Antioche , in which Barnabas , and Symount , that was clepid Blac , and Lucius Cironense , and Manaen , that was the soukynge fere of Eroude tetrarke , and Saul weren .
44013002	And whanne thei mynystriden to the Lord , and fastiden , the Hooli Goost seide to hem , Departe ye to me Saul and Barnabas , in to the werk to which Y haue takun hem .
44013003	Thanne thei fastiden , and preieden , and leiden hondis on hem , and leten hem go .
44013004	But thei weren sent of the Hooli Goost , and wenten forth to Seleucia , and fro thennus thei wenten bi boot to Cipre .
44013005	And whanne thei camen to Salamyne , thei prechiden the word of God in the synagogis of Jewis ; and thei hadden also Joon in mynystrie .
44013006	And whanne thei hadden walkid bi al the ile to Pafum , thei founden a man , a witche , a false profete , a Jewe , to whom the name was Bariesu ,
44013007	that was with the proconsul Sergius Paule , a prudent man . This clepide Barnabas and Poul , and desiride to here the word of God .
44013008	But Elymas witche withstoode hem ; for his name is expowned so ; and he souyte to turne awei the proconsul fro bileue .
44013009	But Saul , which is seid also Paul , was fillid with the Hooli Goost , and bihelde in to hym , and seide , A !
44013010	thou ful of al gile , and al falsnesse , thou sone of the deuel , thou enemye of al riytwisnesse , thou leeuest not to turne vpsodoun the riytful weies of the Lord .
44013011	And now lo ! the hoond of the Lord is on thee , and thou schalt be blynde , and not seynge the sunne in to a tyme . And anoon myste and derknesse felden doun on hym ; and he yede aboute , and souyte hym that schulde yyue hoond to hym .
44013012	Thanne the proconsul , whanne he hadde seyn the dede , bileuede , wondringe on the techyng of the Lord .
44013013	And whanne fro Pafum Poul hadde go bi a boot , and thei that weren with hym , thei camen to Pergen of Pamfilie ; but Joon departide fro hem , and turnede ayen to Jerusalem .
44013014	And thei yeden to Pergen , and camen to Antioche of Persidie ; and thei entriden in to the synagoge in the dai of sabatis , and saten .
44013015	And after the redyng of the lawe and of the prophetis , the princis of the synagoge senten to hem , and seiden , Britheren , if ony word of exortacioun to the puple is in you , seie ye .
44013016	And Poul roos , and with hoond baad silence , and seide , Men of Israel , and ye that dreden God , here ye .
44013017	God of the puple of Israel chees oure fadris , and enhaunside the puple , whanne thei weren comelingis in the loond of Egipt , and in an hiy arme he ledde hem out of it ;
44013018	and bi the tyme of fourti yeeris he suffride her maneres in desert .
44013019	And he destriede seuene folkis in the loond of Canaan , and bi sort departide to hem her lond ,
44013020	as aftir foure hundrid and fifti yeeris . And aftir these thingis he yaf domesmen , to Samuel , the profete .
44013021	And fro that tyme thei axiden a kyng , and God yaf to hem Saul , the sone of Cis , a man of the lynage of Beniamyn , bi fourti yeeris .
44013022	And whanne he was don awei , he reiside to hem Dauid king , to whom he bar witnessing , and seide , Y haue foundun Dauid , the sone of Jesse , a man aftir myn herte , which schal do alle my willis .
44013023	Of whos seed bi the biheest God hath led out to Israel a sauyoure Jhesu ,
44013024	whanne Joon prechide bifor the face of his comyng the baptym of penaunce to al the puple of Israel .
44013025	But whanne Joon fillide his cours , he seide , Y am not he , whom ye demen me to be ; but lo ! he cometh aftir me , and Y am not worthi to doon of the schoon of hise feet .
44013026	Britheren , and sones of the kynde of Abraham , and whiche that in you dreden God , to you the word of helthe is sent .
44013027	For thei that dwelliden at Jerusalem , and princis of it , that knewen not this Jhesu , and the voicis of prophetis , that by euery sabat ben red , demyden , and filliden ;
44013028	and thei founden in hym no cause of deth , and axiden of Pilat , that thei schulden sle hym .
44013029	And whanne thei hadden endid alle thingis that weren writun of hym , thei token hym doun of the tre , and leiden hym in a graue .
44013030	And God reiside hym fro deth in the thridde dai ; which was seyn bi mony daies to
44013031	hem that wenten vp togidere with hym fro Galilee in to Jerusalem , which ben til now his witnessis to the puple .
44013032	And we schewen to you the biheest that was maad to oure fadris ;
44013033	for God hath fulfillid this to her sones , and ayenreisid Jhesu ; as in the secounde salm it is writun , Thou art my sone , to dai Y bigat thee .
44013034	And he ayenreiside hym fro deth , that he schulde not turne ayen in to corrupcioun , seide thus , For Y schal yyue to you the hooli trewe thingis of Dauid .
44013035	And therfor and on an othere stide he seith , Thou schalt not yyue thin hooli to se corrupcioun .
44013036	But Dauid in his generacioun , whanne he hadde mynstrid to the wille of God , diede , and was leid with hise fadris , and say corrupcioun ;
44013037	but he whom God reiside fro deth , say not corrupcioun .
44013038	Therfor , britheren , be it knowun to you , that bi hym remyssioun of synnes is teld to you , fro alle synnes , of whiche ye myyten not be iustified in the lawe of Moises .
44013039	In this ech man that bileueth , is iustified .
44013040	Therfor se ye , that it come not to you , that is biforeseid in the profetis ,
44013041	Ye dispiseris , se ye , and wondre ye , and be ye scaterid abrood ; for Y worche a werk in youre daies , a werk that ye schulen not bileue , if ony man schal telle it to you .
44013042	And whanne thei yeden out , thei preieden , that in the sabat suynge thei schulden speke to hem these wordis .
44013043	And whanne the synagoge was left , manye of Jewis and of comelingis worschypynge God supeden Poul and Barnabas ; that spaken , and counseliden hem , that thei schulden dwelle in the grace of God .
44013044	And in the sabat suynge almest al the citee cam togidir , to here the word of God .
44013045	And Jewis sien the puple , and weren fillid with enuye , and ayenseiden these thingis that weren seyd of Poul , and blasfemyden .
44013046	Thanne Poul and Barnabas stidfastli seiden , To you it bihofte first to speke the word of God ; but for ye putten it awei , and han demyd you vnworthi to euerlastinge lijf , lo ! we turnen to hethen men .
44013047	For so the Lord comaundide vs , Y haue set thee in to liyt to hethen men , that thou be in to helthe to the vtmest of erthe .
44013048	And hethen men herden , ` and ioieden , and glorifieden the word of the Lord ; and bileueden , as manye as weren bifore ordeyned to euerlastinge lijf .
44013049	And the word of the Lord was sowun bi al the cuntre .
44013050	But the Jewis stiriden religiouse wymmen , and onest , and the worthiest men of the citee , and stireden persecucioun ayens Poul and Barnabas , and dryuen hem out of her cuntreis .
44013051	And thei schoken awei in to hem the duste of her feet , and camen to Yconye .
44013052	And the disciplis weren fillid with ioye and the Hooli Goost .
44014001	But it bifelde at Yconye , that thei entriden togidir in to the synagoge of Jewis , and spaken , so that ful greet multitude of Jewis and Grekis bileueden .
44014002	But the Jewis that weren vnbileueful , reiseden persecucioun , and stiriden to wraththe the soulis of hethene men ayens the britheren ; but the Lord yaf soone pees .
44014003	Therfor thei dwelliden myche tyme , and diden tristili in the Lord , berynge witnessyng to the word of his grace , yyuynge signes and wondris to be maad bi the hondis of hem .
44014004	But the multitude of the citee was departid , and sum weren with the Jewis , and sum with the apostlis .
44014005	But whanne ther was maad ` an asaute of the hethene men and the Jewis , with her princis , to turmenten and to stonen hem ,
44014006	thei vndurstoden , and fledden togidere to the citees of Licaonye , and Listris , and Derben , and into al the cuntre aboute .
44014007	And thei prechiden there the gospel , and al the multitude was moued togider in the teching of hem . Poul and Barnabas dwelten at Listris .
44014008	And a man at Listris was sijk in the feet , and hadde sete crokid fro his modris wombe , which neuer hadde goen .
44014009	This herde Poul spekinge ; and Poul biheld hym , and siy that he hadde feith , that he schulde be maad saaf ,
44014010	and seide with a greet vois , Rise thou ` vp riyt on thi feet . And he lippide , and walkide .
44014011	And the puple , whanne thei hadde seyn that that Poul dide , reriden her vois in Licaon tunge , and seiden , Goddis maad lijk to men ben comun doun to vs .
44014012	And thei clepiden Barnabas Jubiter , and Poul Mercurie , for he was ledere of the word .
44014013	And the preest of Jubiter that was bifor the citee , brouyte boolis and crownes bifor the yatis , with puplis , and wolde haue maad sacrifice .
44014014	And whanne the apostlis Barnabas and Poul herden this , thei to-renten her cootis ; and thei skipten out among the puple ,
44014015	and crieden , and seiden , Men , what don ye this thing ? and we ben deedli men lijk you , and schewen to you , that ye be conuertid fro these veyn thingis to the lyuynge God , that maad heuene , and erthe , and the see , and alle thingis that ben in hem ;

44014017	And yit he lefte not hym silf with out witnessing in wel doyng , for he yaf reyns fro heuene , and times beringe fruyt , and fulfillide youre hertis with meete and gladnesse .
44014018	And thei seiynge these thingis , vnnethis swagiden the puple , that thei offriden not to hem .
44014019	But sum Jewis camen ouer fro Antioche and Iconye , and counseilden the puple , and stonyden Poul , and drowen out of the citee , and gessiden that he was deed .
44014020	But whanne disciplis weren comun aboute him , he roos , and wente in to the citee ; and in the dai suynge he wente forth with Barnabas in to Derben .
44014021	And whanne thei hadden prechid to the ilk citee , and tauyte manye , thei turneden ayen to Listris , and Iconye , and to Antioche ; confermynge the soulis of disciplis ,

44014023	And whanne thei hadden ordeined prestis to hem bi alle citees , and hadden preied with fastyngis , thei bitoken hem to the Lord , in whom thei bileueden .
44014024	And thei passiden Persidie , and camen to Pamfilie ;

44014026	And fro thennys thei wenten bi boot to Antiochie , fro whennus thei weren takun to the grace of God , in to the werk that thei filliden .
44014027	And whanne thei weren comun , and hadden gaderid the chirche , thei telden hou grete thingis God dide with hem , and that he hadde openyde to hethene men the dore of feith .

44015004	And whanne thei camen to Jerusalem , thei weren resseyued of the chirche and of the apostlis , and of the eldre men , and telden , hou greet thingis God dide with hem .
44015005	But summe of the erise of Fariseis , that bileueden , risen vp , and seiden , That it bihoueth hem to be circumsidid , and to comaunde to kepe also the lawe of Moises .
44015006	And the apostlis and eldre men camen togidre , to se of ` this word .
44015007	And whanne there was maad a greet sekyng herof , Petre roos , and seide to hem , Britheren , ye witen , that of elde daies in you God chees bi my mouth hethene , to here the word of the gospel , and to bileue ;

44015010	Now thanne what tempten ye God , to putte a yok on the necke of the disciplis , which nether we , nether oure fadris miyten bere ?
44015011	But bi the grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist we bileuen to be saued , as also thei .
44015012	And al the multitude helde pees , and herden Barnaban and Poul , tellinge hou grete signes and wondris God dide bi hem in hethene men .
44015013	And aftir that thei helden pees , James answeride , and seide , Britheren , here ye me .
44015014	Symount telde , hou God visitide , first to take of hethene men a puple to his name .
44015015	And the wordis of prophetis acorden to him ,
44015016	as it is writun , Aftir this Y schal turne ayen , and bilde the tabernacle of Dauid , that felle doun ; and Y schal bilde ayen the cast doun thingis of it , and Y schal reise it ;
44015017	that other men seke the Lord , and alle folkis on which my name is clepid to helpe ; the Lord doynge this thing , seith .
44015018	Fro the world , the werk of the Lord is knowun to the Lord .
44015019	For which thing Y deme hem that of hethene men ben conuertid to God ,
44015020	to be not disesid , but to write to hem , that thei absteyne hem fro defoulingis of maumetis , and fro fornicacioun , and stranglid thingis , and blood .
44015021	For Moyses of elde tymes hath in alle citees hem that prechen him in synagogis , where bi ech sabat he is red .
44015022	Thanne it pleside to the apostlis , and to the eldre men , with al the chirche , to chees men of hem , and sende to Antioche , with Poul and Barnabas , Judas , that was named Barsabas , and Silas , the firste men among britheren ;
44015023	and wroten bi the hondis of hem , Apostlis and eldre britheren to hem that ben at Antioche , and Sirie , and Silice , britheren of hethen men , greting .
44015024	For we herden that summe wenten out fro vs , and trobliden you with wordis , and turneden vpsodoun youre soulis , to whiche men we comaundiden not ,
44015025	it pleside to vs gaderid in to oon , to chese men , and sende to you , with oure most dereworthe Barnabas and Poul ,
44015026	men that yauen her lyues for the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
44015027	Therfor we senten Judas and Silas , and thei schulen telle the same thingis to you bi wordis .
44015028	For it is seyn to the Hooly Goost and to vs , to putte to you no thing more of charge , than these nedeful thingis ,
44015029	that ye absteyne you fro the offrid thingis of maumetis , and blood stranglid , and fornicacioun . Fro whiche ye kepinge you , schulen do wel . Fare ye wel .
44015030	Therfor thei weren let go , and camen doun to Antioche ; and whanne the multitude was gaderid , thei token the epistle ;
44015031	which whanne thei hadden red , thei ioyden on the coumfort .
44015032	And Judas and Silas and thei , for thei weren prophetis , coumfortiden britheren , and confermyden with ful many wordis .
44015033	But aftir that thei hadden be there a lytil while , thei weren let go of britheren with pees , to hem that hadden sent hem .
44015034	But it was seyn to Silas , to dwelle there ; and Judas wente aloone to Jerusalem .
44015035	And Poul and Barnabas dwelten at Antioche , techinge and prechinge the word of the Lord , with othere manye .
44015036	But after summe daies , Poul seide to Barnabas , Turne we ayen , and visite britheren bi alle citees , in whiche we han prechid the word of the Lord , hou thei han hem .
44015037	And Barnabas wolde take with hym Joon , that was named Marcus .
44015038	But Poul preiede him , that he that departide fro hem fro Pamfilie , and wente not with hem in to the werk , schulde not be resseyued .
44015039	And dissencioun was maad , so that thei departiden a twynny . And Barnabas took Mark , and cam bi boot to Cipre .
44015040	And Poul chees Silas , and wente forth fro the britheren , and was bitakun to the grace of God .
44015041	And he wente bi Sirie and Silice , and confermyde the chirche , comaundinge to kepe the heestis of apostlis and eldre men .
44016001	And he cam in to Derben and Listram . And lo ! a disciple was there , bi name Timothe , the sone of a Jewesse cristen , and of the fadir hethen .
44016002	And britheren that weren in Listris and Iconye , yeldiden good witnessing to hym .
44016003	And Poul wolde that this man schulde go forth with him , and he took , and circumsidide hym , for Jewis that weren in the places . For alle wisten , that his fadir was hethen .
44016004	Whanne thei passiden bi citees , thei bitoken to hem to kepe the techingis , that weren demyd of apostlis and eldre men , that weren at Jerusalem .
44016005	And the chirches weren confermed in feith , and encreseden in noumbre eche dai .
44016006	And thei passiden Frigie , and the cuntre of Galathi , and weren forbedun of the Hooli Goost to speke the word of God in Asie .
44016007	And whanne thei camen in to Mysie , thei assaieden to go in to Bithynye , and the spirit of Jhesu suffride not hem .
44016008	But whanne thei hadden passid bi Mysie , thei camen doun to Troade ;
44016009	and a visioun ` bi nyyt was schewid to Poul . But a man of Macedonye that stoode , preiede hym , and seide , Go thou in to Macedonye , and helpe vs .
44016010	And as he hadde sei the visioun , anoon we souyten to go forth in to Macedonye , and weren maad certeyn , that God hadde clepid vs to preche to hem .
44016011	And we yeden bi schip fro Troade , and camen to Samatrachia with streiyt cours ; and the dai suynge to Neapolis ;
44016012	and fro thennus to Filippis , that is the firste part of Macedonye , the citee colonye . And we weren in this citee summe daies , and spaken togidere .
44016013	And in the dai of sabotis we wenten forth with out the yate bisidis the flood , where preier semyde to be ; and we saten , and spaken to wymmen that camen togidere .
44016014	And a womman , Lidda bi name , a purpuresse of the cite of Tiatirens , worschipinge God , herde ; whos herte the Lord openyde to yyue tente to these thingis , that weren seid of Poul .
44016015	And whanne sche was baptisid and hir hous , sche preyede , and seide , If ye han demyd that Y am feithful to the Lord , entre ye in to myn hous , and dwelle .
44016016	And sche constreynede vs . And it was don , whanne we yeden to preier , that a damysel that hadde a spirit of diuynacioun , mette vs , which yaf greet wynnyng to her lordis in dyuynynge .
44016017	This suede Poul and vs , and criede , and seide , These men ben seruauntis of the hiy God , that tellen to you the weie of helthe .
44016018	And this sche dide in many daies . And Poul sorewide , and turnede , and seide to the spirit , Y comaunde thee in the name of Jhesu Crist , that thou go out of hir .
44016019	And he wente out in the same our . And the lordis of hir siyen , that the hope of her wynnyng wente awei , and thei token Poul and Silas , and ledden in to the ` dom place , to the princis .
44016020	And thei brouyten hem to the magistratis , and seiden , These men disturblen oure citee ,
44016021	for thei ben Jewis , and schewen a custom , which it is not leueful to vs to resseyue , nether do , sithen we ben Romayns .
44016022	And the puple ` and magistratis runnen ayens hem , and when thei hadden to-rente the cootis of hem , thei comaundiden hem to be betun with yerdis .
44016023	And whanne thei hadden youun to hem many woundis , thei senten hem into prisoun , and comaundiden to the kepere , that he schulde kepe hem diligentli .
44016024	And whanne he hadde take siche a precept , he putte hem into the ynnere prisoun , and streynede the feet of hem in a tre .
44016025	And at mydniyt Poul and Silas worschipide , and heriden God ; and thei that weren in kepyng herden hem .
44016026	And sudenli a greet erthe mouyng was maad , so that the foundementis of the prisoun weren moued . And anoon alle the doris weren openyd , and the boondis of alle weren lousid .
44016027	And the kepere of the prisoun was awakid , and siy the yatis ` of the prisoun openyd , and with a swerd drawun out he wolde haue slawe hym silf , and gesside that the men that weren boundun , hadden fled .
44016028	But Poul criede with a greet vois , and seide , Do thou noon harm to thi silf , for alle we ben here .
44016029	And he axide liyt , and entride , and tremblide , and felle doun to Poul and to Silas at her feet .
44016030	And he brouyte hem with out forth , and seide , Lordis , what bihoueth me to do , that Y be maad saaf ?
44016031	And thei seiden , Bileue thou in the Lord Jhesu , and thou schalt be saaf , and thin hous .
44016032	And thei spaken to hym the word of the Lord , with alle that weren in his hous .
44016033	And he took hem in the ilke our of the niyt , and waschide her woundis . And he was baptisid , and al his hous anoon .
44016034	And whanne he hadde led hem in to his hous , he settide to hem a boord . And he was glad with al his hous , and bileuede to God .
44016035	And whanne dai was come , the magistratis senten catchepollis , and seiden , Delyuere thou tho men .
44016036	And the kepere of the prisoun telde these wordis to Poul , That the magistratis han sent , that ye be delyuered ; now therfor go ye out , and go ye in pees .
44016037	And Poul seide to hem , Thei senten vs men of Rome in to prisoun , that weren betun openli and vndampned , and now priueli thei bringen vs out ; not so , but come thei hem silf , and delyuere vs out .
44016038	And the catchepollis telden these wordis to the magistratis ; and thei dredden , for thei herden that thei weren Romayns .
44016039	And thei camen , and bisechiden hem , and thei brouyten hem out , and preieden , that thei schulden go out of the citee .
44016040	And thei yeden out of the prisoun , and entriden to Lidie . And whanne thei siyen britheren , thei coumfortiden hem , and yeden forth .
44017001	And whanne thei hadden passid bi Amfipolis and Appollonye , thei camen to Thessolonyk , where was a synagoge of Jewis .
44017002	And bi custom Poul entride to hem , and bi thre sabatis he declaride to hem of scripturis ,
44017003	and openyde , and schewide that it bihofte Crist to suffre , and rise ayen fro deth , and that this is Jhesus Crist , whom Y telle to you .
44017004	And summe of hem bileueden , and weren ioyned to Poul and to Silas ; and a greet multitude of hethene men worschipide God , and noble wymmen not a fewe .
44017005	But the Jewis hadden enuye , and token of the comyn puple summe yuele men , and whanne thei hadden maad a cumpenye , thei moueden the citee . And thei camen to Jasouns hous , and souyten hem to brynge forth among the puple .
44017006	And whanne thei founden hem not , thei drowen Jasoun and summe britheren to the princis of the citee , and crieden , That these it ben , that mouen the world , and hidir thei camen ,
44017007	whiche Jason resseyuede . And these alle don ayens the maundementis of the emperour , and seien , that Jhesu is anothir king .
44017008	And thei moueden the puple , and the princis of the citee , herynge these thingis .
44017009	And whanne satisfaccioun was takun of Jason , and of othere , thei leten Poul and Silas go .
44017010	And anoon bi niyt britheren leten Silas go in to Beroan . And whanne thei camen thidur , thei entriden in to the synagoge of the Jewis .
44017011	But these weren the worthier of hem that ben at Thessolonik , whiche resseyueden the word with al desire , eche dai sekinge scripturis , if these thingis hadden hem so .
44017012	And manye of hem bileueden and of hethen wymmen onest and men not a fewe .
44017013	But whanne the Jewis in Tessalonyk hadden knowe , that also at Bero the word of God was prechid of Poul , thei camen thidir , mouynge and disturblynge the multitude .
44017014	And tho anoon britheren delyuerden Poul , that he schulde go to the see ; but Sylas and Tymothe dwelten there .
44017015	And thei that ledden forth Poul , ledden hym to Atenes . And whanne thei hadden take maundement of him to Silas and to Tymothe , that ful hiyyngli thei schulden come to hym , thei wenten forth .
44017016	And while Poul abood hem at Atenys , his spirit was moued in him , for he saiy the citee youun to ydolatrie .
44017017	Therfor he disputide in the synagoge with the Jewis , and with men that worschipiden God , and in the dom place , by alle daies to hem that herden .
44017018	And summe Epeicureis , and Stoisens , and filosofris disputiden with hym . And summe seiden , What wole this sowere of wordis seie ? And othere seiden , He semeth to be a tellere of newe fendis ; for he telde to hem Jhesu , and the ayenrisyng .
44017019	And thei token , and ledden hym to Ariopage , and seide , Moun we wite , what is this newe doctryne , that is seid of thee ?
44017020	For thou bringist ynne summe newe thingis to oure eeris ; therfor we wolen wite , what these thingis wolen be .
44017021	For alle men of Athenys and comlingis herborid yauen tent to noon other thing , but ether to seie , ethir to here , sum newe thing .
44017022	And Poul stood in the myddil of Ariopage , and seide , Men of Athenys , bi alle thingis Y se you as veyn worschipers .
44017023	For Y passide , and siy youre maumetis , and foond an auter , in which was writun , To the vnknowun God . Therfor which thing ye vnknowynge worschipen , this thing Y schew to you .
44017024	God that made the world and alle thingis that ben in it , this , for he is Lord of heuene and of erthe , dwellith not in templis maad with hoond ,
44017025	nethir is worschipid bi mannus hoondis , nether hath nede of ony thing , for he yyueth lijf to alle men , and brethinge , and alle thingis ;
44017026	and made of oon al the kinde of men to enhabite on al the face of the erthe , determynynge tymes ordeyned , and termes of the dwellynge of hem ,
44017027	to seke God , if perauenture thei felen hym , ether fynden , thouy he be not fer fro eche of you .
44017028	For in hym we lyuen , and mouen , and ben . As also summe of youre poetis seiden , And we ben also the kynde of hym .
44017029	Therfor sithen we ben the kynde of God , we schulen not deme , that godli thing is lijk gold , and siluer , ethir stoon , ethir to grauyng of craft and thouyt of man .
44017030	For God dispisith the tymes of this vnkunnyng , and now schewith to men , that alle euery where doon penaunce ; for that he hath ordeyned a dai ,
44017031	in which he schal deme the world in equite , in a man in which he ordeynede , and yaf feith to alle men , and reiside hym fro deth .
44017032	And whanne thei hadden herd the ayenrysing of deed men , summe scorneden , and summe seiden , We schulen here thee eft of this thing .
44017033	So Poul wente out of the myddil of hem .
44017034	But summen drowen to hym , and bileueden . Among whiche Dynyse Aropagite was , and a womman , bi name Damaris , and othere men with hem .
44018001	Aftir these thingis Poul yede out of Atenes , and cam to Corinthie .
44018002	And he fonde a man , a Jewe , Aquila bi name , of Ponte bi kynde , that late cam from Ytalie , and Priscille , his wijf , for that Claudius comaundide alle Jewis to departe fro Rome ; and he cam to hem .
44018003	And for he was of the same craft , he dwellide with hem , and wrouyte ; and thei weren of roopmakeris craft .
44018004	And he disputide in the synagoge bi ech sabat , puttynge among the name of the Lord Jhesu ; and he counselide Jewis and Grekis .
44018005	And whanne Silas and Tymothe camen fro Macedonye , Poul yaf bisynesse to the word , and witnesside to the Jewis , that Jhesu is Crist .
44018006	But whanne thei ayenseiden and blasfemyden , he schoke awei hise clothis , and seide to hem , Youre blood be on youre heed ; Y schal be clene from hennus forth , and schal go to hethene men .
44018007	And he passide fro thennus , and entride in to the hous of a iust man , Tite bi name , that worschipide God , whos hous was ioyned to the synagoge .
44018008	And Crispe , prince of the synagoge , bileuede to the Lord , with al his hous . And many of the Corinthies herden , and bileueden , and weren cristened .
44018009	And the Lord seide bi nyyt to Poul bi a visioun , Nyle thou drede , but speke , and be not stille ;
44018010	for Y am with thee , and no man schal be put to thee to noye thee , for myche puple is to me in this citee .
44018011	And he dwellide there a yeer and sixe monethis , techinge among hem the word of God .
44018012	But whanne Gallion was proconsul of Acaye , Jewis risen vp with oo wille ayens Poul , and ledden hym to the doom ,
44018013	and seiden , Ayens the lawe this counselith men to worschipe God .
44018014	And whanne Poul bigan to opene his mouth , Gallion seide to the Jewis , If there were ony wickid thing , ether yuel trespas , ye Jewis , riytli Y schulde suffre you ;
44018015	but if questiouns ben of the word , and of names of youre lawe , bisee you silf ; Y wole not be domesman of these thingis .
44018016	And he droof hem fro the doom place .
44018017	And alle token Sostenes , prince of the synagoge , and smoten him bifor the doom place ; and no thing of these was to charge to Gallion .
44018018	And whanne Poul hadde abidun many daies , he seide fare wel to britheren , and bi boot cam to Syrie . And Priscille and Aquila camen with hym , whiche hadden clippid his heed in Tencris ; for he had a vow .
44018019	And he cam to Effesie , and there he lefte hem ; and he yede in to the synagoge , and disputide with Jewis .
44018020	And whanne thei preieden , that he schulde dwelle more time ,
44018021	he consentide not , but he made ` fare wel , and seide , Eft Y schal turne ayen to you , if God wole ; and he wente forth fro Effesi .
44018022	And he cam doun to Cesarie , and he yede vp , and grette the chirche , and cam doun to Antiochie .
44018023	And whanne he hadde dwellide there sumwhat of time , he wente forth , walkinge bi rewe thorou the cuntrei of Galathie , and Frigie , and confermyde alle the disciplis .
44018024	But a Jewe , Apollo bi name , a man of Alisaundre of kinde , a man eloquent , cam to Effesie ; and he was myyti in scripturis .
44018025	This man was tauyt the weie of the Lord , and was feruent in spirit , and spak , and tauyte diligentli tho thingis that weren of Jhesu , and knew oonli the baptym of Joon .
44018026	And this man bigan to do tristili in the synagoge . Whom whanne Priscille and Aquila herden , thei token hym , and more diligentli expowneden to hym the weie of the Lord .
44018027	And whanne he wolde go to Acaie , britheren excitiden , and wroten to the disciplis , that thei schulden resseyue hym ; which whanne he cam , yaf myche to hem that bileueden .
44018028	For he greetli ouercam Jewis , and schewide opynli bi scripturis , that Jhesu is Crist .
44019001	And it bifelle , whanne Apollo was at Corinthi , that Poul whanne he hadde go the hiyer coostis , he cam to Efesie , and foond summe of disciplis .
44019002	And he seide to hem , Whethir ye that bileuen han resseyued the Hooli Goost ? And thei seiden to hym , But nether ` han we herd , if the Hooli Goost is .
44019003	And he seide , Therfor in what thing ben ye baptisid ? And thei seiden , In the baptym of Joon .
44019004	And Poul seide , Joon baptiside the puple in baptym of penaunce , and tauyte , that thei schulden bileue in hym that was to comynge ` after hym , that is , in Jhesu .
44019005	Whanne thei herden these thingis , thei weren baptisid in the name of the Lord Jhesu .
44019006	And whanne Poul hadde leid on hem his hoondis , the Hooli Goost cam in hem , and thei spaken with langagis , and profecieden .
44019007	And alle weren almest twelue men .
44019008	And he yede in to the synagoge , and spak with trist thre monethis , disputinge and tretinge of the kingdom of God .
44019009	But whanne summe weren hardid , and bileueden not , and cursiden the weie of the Lord bifor the multitude , he yede awei fro hem , and departide the disciplis , and disputide in the scole of a myyti man eche dai .
44019010	This was doon bi twei yeeris , so that alle that dwelliden in Asie herden the word of the Lord , Jewis and hethene men .
44019011	And God dide vertues not smale bi the hoond of Poul ,
44019012	so that on sijk men the sudaries weren borun fro his bodye , and sijknessis departiden fro hem , and wickid spiritis wenten out .
44019013	But also summe of the Jewis exorsisists yeden aboute , and assaieden to clepe the name of the Lord Jhesu Crist on hem that hadden yuele spiritis , and seiden , Y coniure you bi Jhesu , whom Poul prechith .
44019014	And ther weren seuene sones of a Jewe , Steuen , a prince of preestis , that diden this thing .
44019015	But the yuel spirit answeride , and seide to hem , Y knowe Jhesu , and Y knowe Poul ; but who ben ye ?
44019016	And the man in which was the worste deuel , lippide on hem , and hadde victorie of bothe , and was stronge ayens hem , that thei nakid and woundid fledden awei fro that hous .
44019017	And this thing was maad knowun to alle the Jewis and to hethene men , that dwelliden at Effesie ; and drede felle doun on hem alle , and thei magnyfieden the name of the Lord Jhesu .
44019018	And many men bileueden , and camen , knowlechinge and tellynge her dedis .
44019019	And manye of them that sueden curiouse thingis , brouyten togidere bookis , and brenneden hem bifor alle men ; and whanne the prices of tho weren acountid , thei founden monei of fifti thousynd pens ;
44019020	so strongli the word of God wexide , and was confermyd .
44019021	And whanne these thingis weren fillid , Poul purposide in spirit , aftir that Macedony was passid and Acaie , to go to Jerusalem , and seide , For aftir that Y schal be there , it bihoueth me ` to se also Rome .
44019022	And he sente in to Macedonye twey men , that mynystriden to hym , Tymothe , and Eraste , and he dwellide for a tyme in Asie .
44019023	And a greet troubling was maad in that dai , of the weie of the Lord .
44019024	For a man , Demetrie bi name , a worcher in siluer , makide siluer housis to Diane , and yaf to crafti men myche wynnyng ;
44019025	which he clepide togidere ` hem that weren suche maner werkmen , and seide , Men , ye witen that of this craft wynnyng is to vs ;
44019026	and ye seen and heren , that this Poul counseilith and turneth awei myche puple , not oonli of Effesie , but almest of al Asie , and seith , that thei ben not goddis , that ben maad with hoondis .
44019027	And not oonli this part schal be in perel to vs , to come in to repreef , but also the temple of the greet Dian schal be acountid in to nouyt ; yhe , and the maieste of hir schal bigynne to be destried , whom al Asie and the world worschipith .
44019028	Whanne these thingis weren herd , thei weren fillid with ire , and crieden , and seiden , Greet is the Dian of Effesians .
44019029	And the citee was fillid with confusioun , and thei maden an asaut with oon wille in to the teaatre , and tooken Gayus and Aristark , men of Macedonye , felawis of Poul .
44019030	And whanne Poul would haue entrid in to the peple , the disciplis suffriden not .
44019031	And also summe of the princis of Asie , that weren hise freendis , senten to him . and preieden , that he schulde not yyue hym silf in to the teatre .
44019032	And othere men crieden othir thing ; for the chirche was confusid , and many wisten not for what cause thei weren come togidere .
44019033	But of the puple thei drowen awei oon Alisaundre , while Jewis puttiden hym forth . And Alisaundre axide with his hoond silence , and wolde yelde a resoun to the puple .
44019034	And as thei knewen that he was a Jew , o vois of alle men was maad , criynge as bi tweyn ouris , Greet Dian of Effesians .
44019035	And whanne the scribe hadde ceessid the puple , he seide , Men of Effesie , what man is he , that knowith not , that the citee of Effesians is the worschipere of greet Dian , and of the child of Jubiter ?
44019036	Therfor whanne it may not be ayenseid to these thingis , it behoueth you to be ceessid , and to do no thing folili ;
44019037	for ye han brouyt these men , nethir sacrilegeris , nethir blasfemynge youre goddesse .
44019038	That if Demetrie , and the werk men that ben with hym , han cause ayens ony man , there ben courtis , and domes , and iugis ; accusen thei eche other .
44019039	If ye seken ouyt of ony othir thing , it may be assoylid in the lawful chirche .
44019040	For whi we ben in perel to be repreuyd of this daies dissencioun , sithen no man is gilti , of whom we moun yelde resoun of this rennyng togidre . And whanne he hadde seid this thing , he lete the puple go .
44019041	
44020001	And aftir the noise ceesside , Poul clepide the disciplis , and monestide hem , and seide fare wel ; and he wente forth , to go in to Macedonye .
44020002	And whanne he hadde walkid bi tho coostis , and hadde monestid hem bi many wordis , he cam to Greece .
44020003	Where whanne he hadde be thre monethis , the Jewis leiden aspies for hym , that was to saile in to Sirie ; and he hadde counsel to turne ayen bi Macedonye .
44020004	And Sosipater of Pirri Boroense folowide hym ; of Thessolonycenses , Astirak , and Secoundus , and Gayus Derbeus , and Tymothe ; and Asians , Titicus and Trofimus .
44020005	These for thei wenten bifore , aboden vs at Troade .
44020006	For we schippiden aftir the daies of therf looues fro Filippis , and cam to hem at Troade in fyue daies , where we dwelten seuene daies .
44020007	And in the first dai of the woke , whanne we camen to breke breed , Poul disputide with hem , and schulde go forth in the morew ;
44020008	and he drow along the sermoun til in to mydnyyt . And many laumpes weren in the soler , where we weren gaderyd togidir .
44020009	And a yong man , Euticus bi name , sat on the wyndowe , whanne he was fallun in to an heuy sleep , while Poul disputide long , al slepynge he felle doun fro the thridde stage ; and he was takun vp , and was brouyt deed .
44020010	To whom whanne Poul cam doun , he lay on hym , and biclippide , and seide , Nyle ye be troblid ; for his soule is in hym .
44020011	And he wente vp , and brak breed , and eete , and spak ynowy vnto the dai ; and so he wente forth .
44020012	And thei brouyten the childe alyue , and thei weren coumfortid greetli .
44020013	And we wenten vp in to a schip , and schippiden in to Asson , to take Poul fro thennus ; for so he hadde disposid to make iourney bi loond .
44020014	And whanne he foond vs in Asson , we token hym , and camen to Mitilene .
44020015	And fro thennus we schippiden in the dai suynge , and we camen ayens Chyum , and another dai we hauenyden at Samum , and in the dai suynge we camen to Mylete .
44020016	And Poul purposide to schip ouer to Efesi , lest ony tariyng were maad to hym in Asie ; for he hiyede , if it were possible to hym , that he schulde be in the dai of Pentecost at Jerusalem .
44020017	Fro Mylete he sente to Effesi , and clepide the grettest men of birthe of the chirche .
44020018	And whanne thei camen to hym , and weren togidir , he seide to hem , Ye witen fro the firste dai , in which Y cam in to Asie , hou with you bi eche tyme Y was ,
44020019	seruynge to the Lord with al mekenesse , and mildnesse , and teeris , and temptaciouns , that felden to me of aspiyngis of Jewis ;
44020020	hou Y withdrowe not of profitable thingis to you , that Y telde not to you , and tauyte you opynli , and bi housis ;
44020021	and Y witnesside to Jewis and to hethene men penaunce in to God , and feith in to oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
44020022	And now lo ! Y am boundun in spirit , and go in to Jerusalem ; and Y knowe not what thingis schulen come to me in it ,
44020023	but that the Hooli Goost ` bi alle citees witnessith to me , and seith , that boondis and tribulaciouns at Jerusalem abiden me .
44020024	But Y drede no thing of these , nether Y make my lijf preciousere than my silf , so that Y end my cours , and the mynysterie of the word , which Y resseyuede of the Lord Jhesu , to witnesse the gospel of the grace of God .
44020025	And ` now lo ! Y woot , that ye schulen no more se my face , alle ye bi whiche Y passide , prechynge the kingdom of God .
44020026	Wherfor Y witnesse to you this day , that Y am cleen of the blood of alle men .
44020027	For Y fley not awey , that Y telde not to you al the counsel of God .
44020028	Take ye tente to you , and to al the flocke , in which the Hooli Goost hath set you bischops , to reule the chirche of God , which he purchaside with his blood .
44020029	Y woot , that aftir my departyng , rauyschinge wolues schulen entre in to you , ` and spare not the flok ;
44020030	and men spekinge schrewid thingis schulen rise of you silf , that thei leden awei disciplis aftir hem .
44020031	For which thing wake ye , holdinge in mynde that bi thre yeer nyyt and dai Y ceesside not with teeris monestinge ech of you .
44020032	And now Y bitake you to God and to the word of his grace , that is myyti to edifie and yyue eritage in alle that ben maad hooli .
44020033	And of no man Y coueitide siluer , and gold , ether cloth , as you silf witen ;
44020034	for to tho thingis that weren nedeful to me , and to these that ben with me , these hoondis mynystriden .
44020035	Alle these thingis Y schewide to you , for so it bihoueth men trauelinge to resseyue sike men , and to haue mynde of the ` word of the Lord Jhesu ; for he seide , It is more blesful to yyue , than to resseyue .
44020036	And whanne he hadde seid these thingis , he knelide , and he preiede with alle hem .
44020037	And greet weping of alle men was maad ; and thei felden on the necke of Poul , and kissiden hym ,
44020038	and sorewiden moost in the word that he seide , for thei schulen no more se his face . And thei ledden hym to the schip .
44021001	And whanne it was don , that we schulden seile , and weren passid awei fro hem , with streiyt cours we camen to Choum , and the day suynge to Rodis , and fro thennus to Patiram , and fro thennus to Myram .
44021002	And whanne we founden a schip passinge ouer to Fenyce , we wenten vp in to it , and sailden forth .
44021003	And whanne we apperiden to Cipre , we leften it at the left half , and seiliden in to Sirie , and camen to Tire . For there the schip schulde be vnchargid .
44021004	And whanne we foundun disciplis , we dwelliden there seuene daies ; whiche seiden bi spirit to Poul , that he schulde not go vp to Jerusalem .
44021005	And whanne the daies weren fillid , we yeden forth , and alle men with wyues and children ledden forth vs with outen the citee ; and we kneliden in the see brenke , and we preieden .
44021006	And whanne we hadden maad fare wel togidre , we wenten vp into the schip ; and thei turneden ayen in to her owne places .
44021007	And whanne the schip sailinge was fillid fro Tire , we camen doun to Tolamayda , and whanne we hadden gret wel the britheren , we dwelliden o dai at hem .
44021008	And another dai we yeden forth , and camen to Cesarie . And we entriden in to the hous of Filip euangelist , that was oon of the seuene , and dwelliden at hym .
44021009	And to hym weren foure douytris , virgyns , that profecieden .
44021010	And whanne we dwelliden there bi summe daies , a profete , Agabus bi name , cam ouer fro Judee .
44021011	This whanne he cam to vs , took the girdil of Poul , and boond togidere hise feet and hoondis , and seide , The Hooli Goost seith these thingis , Thus Jewis schulen bynde in Jerusalem the man , whos is this girdil ; and thei schulen bytake into hethene mennys hoondis .
44021012	Which thing whanne we herden , we preieden , and thei that weren of that place , that he schulde not go vp to Jerusalem .
44021013	Thanne Poul answeride , and seide , What doen ye , wepinge and turmentinge myn herte ? For Y am redi , not oonli to be boundun , but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jhesu .
44021014	And whanne we myyten not counseile hym , we weren stille , and seiden , The wille of the Lord be don .
44021015	And aftir these daies we weren maad redi , and wenten vp to Jerusalem .
44021016	And summe of the disciplis camen with vs fro Cesarie , and ledden with hem a man , Jason of Cipre , an elde disciple , at whom we schulden be herborid .
44021017	And whanne we camen to Jerusalem , britheren resseyueden vs wilfulli .
44021018	And in the dai suynge Poul entride with vs to James , and alle the eldre men weren gaderid .
44021019	Whiche whanne he hadde gret , he telde bi alle thingis , what God hadde doon in hethene men , bi the mynysterie of hym .
44021020	And whanne thei herden , thei magnyfiden God , and seiden to hym , Brothir , thou seest how many thousyndis ben in Jewis , that han bileued to God , and alle ben loueris of the lawe .
44021021	And thei herden of thee , that thou techist departing fro Moises of thilk Jewis that ben bi hethene men , that seien , that thei owen not circumcide her sones , nether owen to entre by custom .
44021022	Therfor what is ? It bihoueth that the multitude come togidre ; for thei schulen here , that thou art come .
44021023	Therfor do thou this thing , that we seien to thee . Ther ben to vs foure men , that han a vow on hem .
44021024	Take thou these men , and halowe thee with hem ; honge on hem , that thei schaue her heedis ; and that alle men wite , that the thingis that thei herden of thee ben false , but that thou walkist , and thi silf kepist the lawe .
44021025	But of these that bileueden of hethene men , we writen , demynge that thei absteyne hem fro thing offrid to idols , and fro blood , and also fro stranglid thing , and fro fornicacioun .
44021026	Thanne Poul took the men , and in the dai suynge he was purified with hem , and entride in to the temple , and schewide the filling of daies of purifying , til the offring was offrid for ech of hem .
44021027	And whanne seuene daies weren endid , the Jewis that weren of Asie , whanne thei saien him in the temple , stiriden al the puple , and leyden hondis on hym ,
44021028	and crieden , Men of Israel , helpe ye vs . This is the man , that ayens the puple and the lawe and this place techith euery where alle men , more ouer and hath led hethene men in to the temple , and hath defoulid this hooli place .
44021029	For thei seyen Trofimus of Effesi in the citee with hym , whom thei gessiden that Poul hadde brouyt in to the temple .
44021030	And al the citee was moued , and a rennyng togider of the puple was maad . And thei token Poul , and drowen him out of the temple ; and anoon the yatis weren closid .
44021031	And whanne thei souyten to sle hym , it was teld to the tribune of the cumpany of knyytis , that al Jerusalem is confoundid .
44021032	Which anoon took knyytis , and centuriens , and ran to hem . And whanne thei hadden seen the tribune , and the knyytis , thei ceessiden to smyte Poul .
44021033	Thanne the tribune cam , and cauyte hym , and comaundide , that he were boundun with twei cheynes ; and axide , who he was , and what he hadde don .
44021034	But othere crieden other thing among the puple . And whanne he miyte ` knowe no certeyn thing for the noise , he comaundide hym to be led in to the castels .
44021035	And whanne Poul cam to the grees , it bifel that he was borun of kniytis , for strengthe of the puple .
44021036	For the multitude of the puple suede hym , and criede , Take hym awei .
44021037	And whanne Poul bigan to be led in to the castels , he seide to the tribune , Whether it is leueful ` to me , to speke ony thing to thee ?
44021038	And he seide , Kanst thou Greek ? Whether thou art not the Egipcian , which bifor these daies mouedist a noise , and leddist out in to desert foure thousynde of men , mensleeris ?
44021039	And Poul seide to hym , For Y am a Jew , of Tharse of Cilicie , a citeseyn , which citee is not vnknowun . And Y preye thee , suffre me to speke to the puple .
44021040	And whanne he suffride , Poul stood in the grees , and bikenede with the hoond to the puple . And whanne a greet silence was maad , he spak in Ebrew tunge , and seide ,
44022001	Britheren and fadris , here ye what resoun Y yelde now to you .
44022002	And whanne sum herden that in Ebrew tunge he spak to hem , thei yauen the more silence .
44022003	And he seide , Y am a man a Jew , borun at Tharse of Cilicie , nurischid and in this citee bisidis the feet of Gamaliel , tauyt bi the treuthe of fadris lawe , a louyere of the lawe , as also ye alle ben to dai .
44022004	And Y pursuede this weie til to the deth , byndynge and bitakinge ` in to holdis men and wymmen ,
44022005	as the prince of prestis yeldith witnessyng to me , and alle the grettest in birth . Of whom also Y took pistlis to britheren , and wente to Damask , to bring fro thennys men boundun in to Jerusalem , that thei schulden be peyned .
44022006	And it was don , while Y yede , and neiyede to Damask , at myddai sudeynli fro heuene a greet plente of liyt schoon aboute me .
44022007	And Y felde doun to the erthe , and herde a voice fro heuene , seiynge to me , Saul , Saul , what pursuest thou me ? It is hard to thee to kike ayens the pricke .
44022008	And Y answeride , Who art thou , Lord ? And he seide to me , Y am Jhesu of Nazareth , whom thou pursuest .
44022009	And thei that weren with me sien but the liyt , but thei herden not the vois of hym , that spak with me .
44022010	And Y seide , Lord , what schal Y do ? And the Lord seide to me , Rise thou , and go to Damask ; and there it schal be seid to thee , of alle thingis which it bihoueth thee to do .
44022011	And whanne Y saye not , for the clerete of that liyt , Y was led bi the hond of felowis , and Y cam to Damask .
44022012	And a man , Ananye , that bi the lawe hadde wytnessyng of alle Jewis dwellinge in Damask ,
44022013	cam to me , and stood niy , and seide to me , Saul , brother , biholde . And Y in the same our biheelde in to hym .
44022014	And he seide , God of oure fadris hath bifor ordeyned thee , that thou schuldist knowe the wille of him , and schuldist se the riytful man , and here the vois of his mouth .
44022015	For thou schalt be his witnesse to alle men , of tho thingis that thou hast seyn and herd .
44022016	And now , what dwellist thou ? Rise vp , and be baptisid , and waische awei thi synnes , bi the name of hym clepid to help .
44022017	And it was don to me , as Y turnede ayen in to Jerusalem , and preyede in the temple , that Y was maad in rauysching of soule ,
44022018	and Y siy him seiynge to me , Hiye thou , and go out faste of Jerusalem , for thei schulen not resseyue thi witnessing of me .
44022019	And Y seide , Lord , thei witen , that Y was closing togidir ` in to prisoun , and betinge bi synagogis hem that bileueden ` in to thee .
44022020	And whanne the blood of Steuene , thi witnesse , was sched out , Y stood niy , and consentide , and kept the clothis of men that slowen hym .
44022021	And he seide to me , Go thou , for Y schal sende thee fer to naciouns .
44022022	And thei herden him til this word ; and thei reiseden her vois , and seiden , Take awei fro the erthe siche a maner man ; for it is not leueful , that he lyue .
44022023	And whanne thei crieden , and kesten awei her clothis , and threwen dust in to the eir ,
44022024	the tribune comaundide hym to be led in to castels , and to be betun with scourgis , and to be turmentid , that he wiste , for what cause thei crieden so to him .
44022025	And whanne thei hadden boundun hym with cordis , Poul seide to a centurien stondinge niy to hym , Whether it is leueful to you , to scourge a Romayn , and vndampned ?
44022026	And whanne this thing was herd , the centurien wente to the tribune , and telde to hym , and seide , What art thou to doynge ? for this man is a citeseyn of Rome .
44022027	And the tribune cam niy , and seide to hym , Seie thou to me , whether thou art a Romayn ?
44022028	And he seide , Yhe . And the tribune answeride , Y with myche summe gat this fredom . And Poul seide , And Y was borun a citeseyn of Rome .
44022029	Therfor anoon thei that schulden haue turmentid hym , departiden awei fro hym . And the tribune dredde , aftir that he wiste , that he was a citeseyn of Rome , and for he hadde boundun hym .
44022030	But in the dai suynge he wolde wite more diligentli , for what cause he were accusid of the Jewis , and vnbounde hym , and comaundide prestis and al the counsel to come togidir . And he brouyte forth Poul , and sette hym among hem .
44023001	And Poul bihelde in to the counsel , and seide , Britheren , Y with al good conscience haue lyued bifore God , ` til in to this dai .
44023002	And Anany , prince of prestis , comaundide to men that stoden nyy hym , that thei schulden smyte his mouth .
44023003	Thanne Poul seide to hym , Thou whitid wal , God smyte thee ; thou sittist , and demest me bi the lawe , and ayens the law thou comaundist me to be smytun .
44023004	And thei that stoden niy , seiden , Cursist thou the hiyest prest of God ?
44023005	And Poul seide , Britheren , Y wiste not , that he is prince of preestis ; for it is writun , Thou schalt not curse the prince of thi puple .
44023006	But Poul wiste , that o parti was of Saduceis , and the othere of Fariseis ; and he criede in the counsel , Britheren , Y am a Farisee , the sone of Farisees ; Y am demyd of the hope and of the ayen rising of deed men .
44023007	And whanne he hadde seid this thing , dissencioun was maad bitwixe the Fariseis and the Saduceis , and the multitude was departid .
44023008	For Saduceis seien , that no ` rysing ayen of deed men is , nether aungel , nether spirit ; but Fariseis knowlechen euer eithir .
44023009	And a greet cry was maad . And summe of Farisees rosen vp , and fouyten , seiynge , We fynden no thing of yuel in this man ; what if a spirit , ether an aungel spak to hym ?
44023010	And whanne greet discencioun was maad , the tribune dredde , lest Poul schulde be to-drawun of hem ; and he comaundide knyytis to go doun , and to take hym fro the myddil of hem , and to lede hym in to castels .
44023011	And in the niyt suynge the Lord stood niy to hym , and seide , Be thou stidfast ; for as thou hast witnessid of me in Jerusalem , so it bihoueth thee to witnesse also at Rome .
44023012	And whanne the dai was come , summe of the Jewis gaderiden hem , and maden ` avow , and seiden , that thei schulden nether eete , ne drinke , til thei slowen Poul .
44023013	And there weren mo than fourti men , that maden this sweryng togider .
44023014	And thei wenten to the princis of prestis , and eldre men , and seiden , With deuocioun we han a vowid , that we schulen not taste ony thing , til we sleen Poul .
44023015	Now therfor make ye knowun to the tribune , with the counsel , that he bringe hym forth to you , as if ye schulden knowe sum thing more certeynli of hym ; and we ben redi to sle hym , bifor that he come .
44023016	And whanne the sone of Poulis sister hadde herd the aspies , he cam , and entride in to the castels , and telde to Poul .
44023017	And Poul clepide to hym oon of the centuriens , and seide , Lede this yonge man to the tribune , for he hath sum thing to schewe to hym .
44023018	And he took hym , and ledde to the tribune , and seide , Poul , that is boundun , preide me to lede to thee this yonge man , that hath sum thing to speke to thee .
44023019	And the tribune took his hoond , and wente with hym asidis half , and axide hym , What thing is it , that thou hast to schewe to me ?
44023020	And he seide , The Jewis ben acordid to preye thee , that to morewe thou brynge forth Poul in to the counsel , as if thei schulden enquere sum thing more certeynli of hym .
44023021	But bileue thou not to hem ; for mo than fourti men of hem aspien hym , which han a vowid , that thei schulen not eete nether drynke , til thei sleen hym ; and now thei ben redi , abidinge thi biheest .
44023022	Therfor the tribune lefte the yonge man , and comaundide , that he schulde speke to no man , that he hadde maad these thingis knowun to hym .
44023023	And he clepide togidre twei centuriens , and he seide to hem , Make ye redi twei hundrid knyytis , that thei go to Cesarie , and horse men seuenti , and spere men twey hundrid , fro the thridde our of the nyyt .
44023024	And make ye redy an hors , for Poul to ride on , to lede hym saaf to Felix , the presydent .
44023025	For the tribune dredde , lest the Jewis wolden take hym bi the weie , and sle hym , and aftirward he miyte be chalengid , as he hadde take money .
44023026	And wroot hym ` a pistle , conteynynge these thingis . Claudius Lisias to the beste Felix , president , heelthe .
44023027	This man that was take of the Jewis , and bigan to be slayn , Y cam vpon hem with myn oost , and delyuerede hym fro hem , whanne Y knewe that he was a Romayn .
44023028	And Y wolde wite the cause , which thei puttiden ayens hym ; and Y ledde hym to the counsel of hem .
44023029	And Y foond , that he was accusid of questiouns of her lawe , but he hadde no cryme worthi the deth , ethir boondis .
44023030	And whanne it was teeld me of the aspies , that thei arayden for hym , Y sente hym to thee , and Y warnede also the accuseris , that thei seie at thee . Fare wel .
44023031	And so the knyytis , as thei weren comaundid , token Poul , and ledde hym bi nyyt into Antipatriden .
44023032	And in the dai suynge , whanne the horsmen weren left , that schulden go with hym , thei turneden ayen to the castels .
44023033	And whanne thei camen to Cesarie , thei token the pistle to the president , and thei setten also Poul byfore him .
44023034	And whanne he hadde red , and axide , of what prouynce he was , and knewe that he was of Cilicie ,
44023035	Y schal here thee , he seide , whanne thin accuseris comen . And he comaundide hym to be kept in the moot halle of Eroude .
44024001	And aftir fyue daies , Ananye , prince of preestis , cam doun with summe eldere men , and Terculle , a feir speker , which wenten to the precident ayens Poul .
44024002	And whanne Poul was somened , Terculle bigan to accuse hym , and seide , Whanne in myche pees we doon bi thee , and many thingis ben amendid bi thi wisdom , euere more and euery where ,
44024003	thou best Felix , we han resseyued with al doyng of thankingis .
44024004	But lest Y tarie thee lengere , Y preie thee , schortly here vs for thi mekenesse .
44024005	We han foundun this wickid man stirynge dissencioun to alle Jewis in al the world , and auctour of dissencioun of the secte of Nazarenus ; and he also enforside to defoule the temple ;
44024006	whom also we token , and wolden deme , after oure lawe .
44024007	But Lisias , the trybune , cam with greet strengthe aboue , and delyuerede hym fro oure hoondis ;
44024008	and comaundide hise accuseris to come to thee , of whom thou demynge , maist knowe of alle these thingis , of whiche we accusen hym .
44024009	And Jewis putten to , and seiden , that these thingis hadden hem so .
44024010	And Poul answeride , whanne the president grauntide hym to seie , Of mony yeeris Y knowe thee , that thou art domesman ` to this folk , and Y schal do ynowy for me with good resoun .
44024011	For thou maist knowe , for to me ben not more than twelue daies , sithen Y cam vp to worschipe in Jerusalem ;
44024012	and nether in the temple thei founden me disputinge with ony man , nether makynge concours of puple , nether in synagogis , nether in citee ;
44024013	nether thei moun preue to thee , of the whiche thingis thei now accusen me .
44024014	But Y knowleche to thee this thing , that aftir the secte which thei seien eresie , so Y serue to God the fadir , ` and Y bileue to alle thingis that ben writun in the lawe and profetis ; and Y haue hope in God ,
44024015	whiche also thei hem silf abiden , the ayenrisyng ` to comynge of iust men and wickid .
44024016	In this thing Y studie with outen hirtyng , to haue concience to God , and to men euermore .
44024017	But after many yeeris , Y cam to do almes dedis to my folc , and offryngis , and auowis ;
44024018	in whiche thei founden me purified in the temple , not with company , nether with noise . And thei cauyten me , and thei crieden , and seiden , Take awei oure enemye .
44024019	And summe Jewis of Asie , whiche it behofte to be now present at thee , and accuse , if thei hadden ony thing ayens me ,
44024020	ether these hem silf seie , if thei founden in me ony thing of wickidnesse , sithen Y stonde ` in the counsel ,
44024021	but oneli of this vois , by which Y criede stondynge among hem , For of the ayenrisyng of deed men Y am demyd this dai of you .
44024022	Sothely Felix delayede hem , and knewe moost certeynli of the weie , and seide , Whanne Lisias , the tribune , schal come doun , Y schal here you .
44024023	And he comaundide to a centurien to kepe hym , and that he hadde reste , nethir to forbede ony man to mynystre of his owne thingis to him .
44024024	And after summe dayes Felix cam , with Drussille his wijf , that was a Jewesse , and clepide Poul , and herde of him the feith that is in Crist Jhesu .
44024025	And while he disputide of riytwisnesse , and chastite , and of dom to comynge , Felix was maad tremblinge , and answerde , That perteneth now , go ; but in tyme couenable Y schal clepe thee .
44024026	Also he hopide , that money schulde be youun to hym of Poul ; for which thing eft he clepide hym , and spak with hym .
44024027	And whanne twei yeeris weren fillid , Felix took a successoure , Porcius Festus ; and Felix wolde yyue grace to Jewis , and lefte Poul boundun .
44025001	Therfor whanne Festus cam in to the prouynce , aftir the thridde dai he wente vp to Jerusalem fro Cesarie .
44025002	And the princis of prestis , and the worthieste of the Jewis wenten to hym ayens Poul , and preieden hym ,
44025003	and axiden grace ayens hym , that he schulde comaunde hym to be led to Jerusalem ; and thei settiden aspies to sle hym in the weie .
44025004	But Festus answerde , that Poul schulde be kept in Cesarie ; sotheli that he hym silf schulde procede more auisili . Therfor he seide , Thei that in you ben myyti ,
44025005	come doun togidere ; and if ony crime is in the man , accuse thei hym .
44025006	And he dwellede among hem no more than eiyte ether ten daies , and cam doun to Cesarie ; and the tother dai he sat for domesman , and comaundide Poul to be brouyt .
44025007	And whanne he was brouyt forth , Jewis stoden aboute hym , whiche camen doun fro Jerusalem , puttynge ayens hym many and greuouse causis , whiche thei miyten not preue .
44025008	For Poul yeldide resoun in alle thingis , That nether ayens the lawe of Jewis , nether ayens the temple , nether ayens the emperoure , Y synnede ony thing .
44025009	But Festus wolde do grace to the Jewis , and answeride to Poul , and seide , Wolt thou gon vp to Jerusalem , and there be demyd of these thingis bifore me ?
44025010	And Poul seide , At the domplace of the emperour Y stonde , where it bihoueth me to be demed . Y haue not noied the Jewis , as thou knowist wel .
44025011	For if Y haue noyed , ether don ony thing worthi deth , Y forsake not to die ; but if no thing of tho is , that thei accusen me , no man may yyue me to hem . Y appele to the emperour .
44025012	Thanne Festus spak with the counsel , and answerde , To the emperoure thou hast appelid , to the emperoure thou schalt go .
44025013	And whanne summe daies weren passid , Agrippa kyng , and Beronyce camen doun to Cesarie , to welcome Festus .
44025014	And whanne thei dwelliden there many daies , Festus schewide to the king of Poul , and seide , A man is left boundun of Felix ,
44025015	of which , whanne Y was at Jerusalem , princis of preestis and the eldre men of Jewis camen to me , and axiden dampnacioun ayens hym .
44025016	To whiche Y answeride , That it is not custom to Romayns , to dampne ony man , bifore that he that is accusid haue hise accuseris present , and take place of defending , to putte awei the crymes , that ben putte ayens hym .
44025017	Therfor whanne thei camen togidere hidir , withouten ony delaye , in the dai suynge Y sat for domesman , and comaundide the man to be brouyt .
44025018	And whanne hise accuseris stoden , thei seiden no cause , of whiche thingis Y hadde suspicioun of yuel .
44025019	But thei hadden ayens hym summe questiouns of her veyn worschiping , and of oon Jhesu deed , whom Poul affermyde to lyue .
44025020	And Y doutide of siche maner questioun , and seide , Whether he wolde go to Jerusalem , and ther be demyd of these thingis ?
44025021	But for Poul appelide , that he schulde be kept to the knowing of the emperoure , Y comaundide him to be kept , til Y sende hym to the emperoure .
44025022	And Agrippa seide to Festus , Y my silf wolde here the man . And he seide , To morew thou schalt here hym .
44025023	And on the tother day , whanne Agrippa and Beronyce camen with greet desire , and entriden in to the auditorie , with tribunes and the principal men of the citee , whanne Festus bad , Poul was brouyt .
44025024	And Festus seide , King Agrippa , and alle men that ben with vs , ye seen this man , of which al the multitude of Jewis preyede me at Jerusalem , and axide , and criede , that he schulde lyue no lenger .
44025025	But Y foond , that he hadde don no thing worthi of deth ; and Y deme to sende hym to the emperoure , for he appelide this thing .
44025026	Of which man Y haue not certeyne , what thing Y schal write to the lord . For which thing Y brouyte hym to you , and moost to thee , thou king Agrippa , that whanne axing is maad , Y haue what Y schal write .
44025027	For it is seyn to me with out resoun , to sende a boundun man , and not to signifie the cause of hym .
44026001	And Agrippa seide to Poul , It is suffrid to thee , to speke for thi silf . Thanne Poul helde forth the hoond , and bigan to yelde resoun .
44026002	Of alle thingis , in whiche Y am accusid of the Jewis , thou king Agrippa , Y gesse me blessid at thee , whanne Y schal defende me this dai ;
44026003	moost for thou knowist alle thingis that ben among Jewis , customes and questiouns . For which thing , Y biseche , here me pacientli .
44026004	For alle Jewis that bifor knewen me fro the bigynnyng , knewen my lijf fro yongthe ; that fro the bigynnyng was in my folc in Jerusalem ,
44026005	if thei wolen bere witnessing , that bi the moost certeyn sect of oure religioun , Y lyuede a Farisee .
44026006	And now for the hope of repromyssioun , that is maad to oure fadris of God , Y stonde suget in dom ;
44026007	in which hope oure twelue lynagis seruynge niyt and dai hopen to come ; of which hope , sir king , Y am accusid of the Jewis .
44026008	What vnbileueful thing is demed at you , if God reisith deed men ?
44026009	And sotheli Y gesside , that Y ouyte do many contrarie thingis ayens the name of Jhesu Nazarene .
44026010	Which thing also Y dide in Jerusalem , and Y encloside manye of the seyntis in prisoun , whanne Y hadde take powere of the princis of preestis . And whanne thei weren slayn , Y brouyte the sentence .
44026011	And bi alle synagogis ofte Y punyschide hem , and constreynede to blasfeme ; and more Y wex wood ayens hem , and pursuede in to alien citees .
44026012	In whiche , the while Y wente to Damask , with power and suffring of princis of preestis ,
44026013	at myddai , in the weie Y say , sir king , that fro heuene liyt schynede aboute me , passing the schynyng of the sunne , and aboute hem that weren togidir with me .
44026014	And whanne we alle hadden falle doun in to the erthe , Y herde a vois seiynge to me in Ebrew tunge , Saul , Saul , what pursuest thou me ? it is hard to thee , to kicke ayens the pricke .
44026015	And Y seide , Who art thou , Lord ? And the Lord seide , Y am Jhesus , whom thou pursuest .
44026016	But rise vp , and stoond on thi feet . For whi to this thing Y apperide to thee , that Y ordeyne thee mynystre and witnesse of tho thingis that thou hast seyn , and of tho in whiche Y schal schewe to thee .
44026017	And Y schal delyuere thee fro puplis and folkis , to whiche now Y sende thee ,
44026018	to opene the iyen of hem , that thei ben conuertid fro derknesse to liyt , and fro power of Sathnas to God , that thei take remyssioun of synnes , and part among seyntis , bi feith that is in me .
44026019	Wherfor , sir kyng Agrippa , Y was not vnbileueful to the heuenli visioun ;
44026020	but Y tolde to hem that been at Damask first , and at Jerusalem , and bi al the cuntre of Judee , and to hethene men , that thei schulden do penaunce , and be conuertid to God , and do worthi werkis of penaunce .
44026021	For this cause Jewis token me , whanne Y was in the temple , to sle me .
44026022	But Y was holpun bi the helpe of God in to this dai , and stonde , witnessinge to lesse and to more . And Y seye no thing ellis than whiche thingis the prophetis and Moises spaken that schulen come ,
44026023	if Crist is to suffre , if he is the firste of the ayenrising of deed men , that schal schewe liyt to the puple and to hethene men .
44026024	Whanne he spak these thingis , and yeldide resoun , Festus seide with greet vois , Poul , thou maddist ; many lettris turnen thee to woodnesse .
44026025	And Poul seide , Y madde not , thou beste Festus , but Y speke out the wordis of treuthe and of sobernesse .
44026026	For also the king , to whom Y speke stidfastli , woot of these thingis ; for Y deme , that no thing of these is hid fro hym ; for nether in a cornere was ouyt of these thingis don .
44026027	Bileuest thou , king Agrippa , ` to prophetis ? Y woot that thou bileuest .
44026028	And Agrippa seide to Poul , In litil thing thou counseilist me to be maad a cristen man .
44026029	And Poul seide , Y desire anentis God , bothe in litil and in greet , not oneli thee , but alle these that heren to dai , to be maad sich as Y am , outakun these boondis .
44026030	And the kyng roos vp , and the president , and Beronyce , and thei that saten niy to hem .
44026031	And whanne thei wenten awei , thei spaken togider , and seiden , That this man hath not don ony thing worthi deth , nether boondis .
44026032	And Agrippa seide to Festus , This man miyt be delyuerid , if he hadde not appelid to the emperour .
44027001	But as it was demed hym to schippe into Ytalie , thei bitoken Poul with othere kepers to a centurien , bi name Julius , of the cumpeny of knyytis of the emperoure .
44027002	And we wenten vp in to the schip of Adrymetis , and bigunnen to seile , and weren borun aboute the placis of Asie , while Aristark of Macedonye , Tessalonycence , dwellide stille with vs .
44027003	And in the dai suynge , we camen to Sydon ; and Julius tretyde curteisli Poul , and suffride to go to frendis , and do his nedis .
44027004	And whanne we remouede fro thennus , we vndurseiliden to Cipre , for that wyndis weren contrarie .
44027005	And we seiliden in the see of Silicie and Pamfilie , and camen to Listris , that is Licie .
44027006	And there the centurien foond a schip of Alisaundre , seilinge in to Ytalie , and puttide vs ouer in to it .
44027007	And whanne in many daies we seilden slowli , and vnnethe camen ayens Guydum , for the winde lettide vs , we seiliden to Crete , bisidis Salomona .
44027008	And vnnethe we seilden bisidis , and camen into a place , that is clepid of good hauen , to whom the cite Tessala was niy .
44027009	And whanne miche time was passid , and whanne seiling thanne was not sikir , for that fasting was passid , Poul coumfortide hem ,
44027010	and seide to hem , Men , Y se that seiling bigynneth to be with wrong and myche harm , not oonli of charge and of the schip , but also of oure lyues .
44027011	But the centurien bileuede more to the gouernour , and to the lord of the schip , thanne to these thingis that weren seid of Poul .
44027012	And whanne the hauene was not able to dwelle in wynter , ful many ordeyneden counsel to seile fro thennus , if on ony maner thei miyten come to Fenyce , to dwelle in wynter at the hauene of Crete , which biholdith to Affrik , and to Corum .
44027013	And whanne the south blew , thei gessiden hem to holde purpos ; and whanne thei hadden removed fro Asson , thei seiliden to Crete .
44027014	And not aftir miche , the wynde Tifonyk , that is clepid north eest , was ayens it .
44027015	And whanne the schip was rauyschid , and myyte not enforse ayens the wynde , whanne the schip was youun to the blowynges of the wynde , we weren borun with cours into an ile ,
44027016	that is clepid Canda ; and vnethe we miyten gete a litil boot .
44027017	And whanne this was takun vp , thei vsiden helpis , girdinge togidere the schippe ; and dredden , lest thei schulden falle into sondi placis . And whanne the vessel was vndur set , so thei weren borun .
44027018	And for we weren throwun with strong tempest , in the dai suynge thei maden casting out .
44027019	And the thridde dai with her hoondis thei castiden awei the instrumentis of the schip .
44027020	And whanne the sunne nether the sterris weren seie bi many daies , and tempest not a litil neiyede , now al the hope of oure helthe was don awei .
44027021	And whanne myche fasting hadde be , thanne Poul stood in the myddil of hem , and seide , A ! men , it bihofte , whanne ye herden me , not to haue take awei the schip fro Crete , and gete this wronge and casting out .
44027022	And now Y counsel you to be of good coumfort , for los of no persoone of you schal be , outakun of the schip .
44027023	For an aungel of God , whos Y am , and to whom Y serue , stood niy to me in this niyt , and seide , Poul , drede thou not ;
44027024	it bihoueth thee to stonde bifore the emperour . And lo ! God hath youun to thee alle that ben in the schip with thee .
44027025	For which thing , ye men , be ye of good coumfort ; for Y bileue to my God , that so it schal be , as it is seid to me .
44027026	And it bihoueth vs to come into sum yle .
44027027	But aftirward that in the fourtenthe dai the niyt cam on vs seilinge in the stony see , aboute mydniyt the schipmen supposiden sum cuntre to appere to hem .
44027028	And thei kesten doun a plommet , and founden twenti pasis of depnesse . And aftir a litil thei weren departid fro thennus , and foundun fiftene pasis .
44027029	And thei dredden , lest we schulden haue fallun in to scharp placis ; and fro the last parti of the schip thei senten foure ankeris , and desiriden that the dai hadde be come .
44027030	And whanne the schipmen souyten to fle fro the schip , whanne thei hadden sent a litil boot in to the see , vndur colour as thei schulden bigynne to stretche forth the ankeris fro the formere part of the schip ,
44027031	Poul seide to the centurien and to the knyytis , But these dwellen in the schip , ye moun not be maad saaf .
44027032	Thanne knyytis kittiden awei the cordis of the litil boot , and suffriden it to falle awei .
44027033	And whanne the dai was come , Poul preiede alle men to take mete , and seide , The fourtenthe dai this dai ye ` abiden , and dwellen fastinge , and taken no thing .
44027034	Wherfor Y preie you to take mete , for youre helthe ; for of noon of you the heer of the heed schal perische .
44027035	And whanne he hadde seid these thingis , Poul took breed , and dide thankyngis to God in the siyt of alle men ; and whanne he hadde brokun , he bigan to eete .
44027036	And alle weren maad of betere coumfort , and thei token mete .
44027037	And we weren alle men in the schip , two hundrid seuenti and sexe .
44027038	And thei weren fillid with mete , and dischargiden the schip , and castiden whete in to the see .
44027039	And whanne the dai was comun , thei knewen no lond ; and thei bihelden an hauene that hadde a watir bank , in to which thei thouyten , if thei miyten , to bringe vp the schip .
44027040	And whanne thei hadden take vp the ankeris , thei bitoken hem to the see , and slakiden togidir the ioyntours of gouernails . And with a litil seil lift vp , bi blowyng of the wynde thei wenten to the bank .
44027041	And whanne we felden into a place of grauel gon al aboute with the see , thei hurtliden the schip . And whanne the formere part was fitchid , it dwellide vnmouable , and the last part was brokun of strengthe of the see .
44027042	And counsel of the kniytis was , to sle men that weren in warde , lest ony schulde ascape , whanne he hadde swymmed out .
44027043	But the centurien wolde kepe Poul , and forbede it to be don . And he comaundide hem that miyte swymme , to go in to the see , and scape , and go out to the loond .
44027044	And thei baren summe othere on boordis , summe on tho thingis that weren of the schip . And so it was don , that alle men ascapiden to the lond .
44028001	And whanne we hadden ascapid , thanne we knewen that the ile was clepid Militene . And the hethene men diden to vs not litil curtesie .
44028002	And whanne a fier was kyndelid , thei refreschiden vs alle , for the reyn that cam , and the coold .
44028003	But whanne Poul hadde gederid ` a quantite of kittingis of vines , and leide on the fier , an edder sche cam forth fro the heete , and took hym bi the hoond .
44028004	And whanne the hethene men of the ile siyen the beest hangynge in his hoond , thei seiden togidir , For this man is a manquellere ; and whanne he scapide fro the see , Goddis veniaunce suffrith hym not to lyue in erthe .
44028005	But he schoke awei the beest in to the fier , and hadde noon harm .
44028006	And thei gessiden that he schulde be turned ` in to swellyng , and falle doun sudenli , and die . But whanne thei abiden longe , and sien that no thing of yuel was don in him , thei turneden hem togider , and seiden , that he was God .
44028007	And in tho placis weren maners of the prince of the ile , Puplius bi name , which resseyuede vs bi thre daies benygnli , and foond vs .
44028008	And it bifel , that the fader of Pupplius lai trauelid with fyueris and blodi flux . To whom Poul entride , and whanne he hadde preied , and leid his hondis on hym , he helide hym .
44028009	And whanne this thing was don , alle that in the ile hadden sijknesses , camen , and weren heelid .
44028010	Which also onouriden vs in many worschipis , and puttiden what thingis weren necessarie to vs , whanne we schippiden .
44028011	And after thre monethis we schippiden in a schip of Alisaundre , that hadde wyntrid in the ile , to which was an excellent singne of Castours .
44028012	And whanne we camen to Siracusan , we dwelliden there thre daies .
44028013	Fro thennus we seiliden aboute , and camen to Regyum ; and aftir oo dai , while the south blew , in the secounde dai we camen to Puteolos .
44028014	Where whanne we founden britheren , we weren preied to dwelle there anentis hem seuene daies . And so we camen to Rome .
44028015	And fro thennus whanne britheren hadden herd , thei camen to vs to the cheping of Appius , and to the Thre tauernes .
44028016	And whanne Poul hadde seyn hem , he dide thankyngis to God , and took trist . And whanne ` we camen to Rome , it was suffrid to Poul to dwelle bi hym silf , with a kniyt kepinge him .
44028017	And after the thridde dai , he clepide togidir the worthieste of the Jewis . And whanne thei camen , he seide to hem , Britheren , Y dide no thing ayens the puple ether custom of fadris , and Y was boundun at Jerusalem , and was bitakun in to the hondis of Romayns .
44028018	And whanne thei hadden axid of me , wolden haue delyuerid me , for that no cause of deth was in me .
44028019	But for Jewis ayenseiden , Y was constreyned to appele to the emperour ; not as hauynge ony thing to accuse my puple .
44028020	Therfor for this cause Y preiede to se you , and speke to you ; for for the hope of Israel Y am gird aboute with this chayne .
44028021	And thei seiden to hym , Nether we han resseyued lettris of thee fro Judee , nether ony of britheren comynge schewide , ether spak ony yuel thing of thee .
44028022	But we preyen to here of thee , what thingis thou felist ; for of this sect it is knowun to vs , that euerywhere me ayenseith it .
44028023	And whanne thei hadden ordeined a dai to hym , many men camen to hym in to the in . To whiche he expownede , witnessinge the kyngdom ` of God , and counseilide hem of Jhesu , of the lawe of Moyses , and profetis , for the morewe til to euentid .
44028024	And summe bileueden to these thingis that weren seid of Poul , summe bileueden not .
44028025	And whanne thei weren not consentinge togidir , thei departiden . And Poul seide o word , For the Hooli Goost spak wel bi Ysaye , the profete , to oure fadris ,
44028026	and seide , Go thou to this puple , and seie to hem , With eere ye schulen here , and ye schulen not vndirstonde ; and ye seynge schulen se , and ye schulen not biholde .
44028027	For the herte of this puple is greetli fattid , and with eeris thei herden heuyli , and thei closiden togider her iyen , lest perauenture thei se with iyen , and with eeris here , and bi herte vndurstonde , and be conuertid , and Y hele hem .
44028028	Therfor be it knowun to you , that this helthe of God is sent to hethen men , and thei schulen here .
44028029	And whanne he hadde seid these thingis , Jewis wenten out fro hym , and hadden myche questioun , ethir musyng , among hem silf .
44028030	And he dwellide ful twei yeer in his hirid place ; and he resseyuede alle that entryden to hym ,
44028031	and prechide the kingdom of God , and tauyte tho thingis that ben of the Lord Jhesu Crist , with al trist , with out forbedyng . Amen .
45001001	Poul , the seruaunt of Jhesu Crist , clepid an apostle , departid in to the gospel of God ;
45001002	which he hadde bihote tofore bi his profetis in holi scripturis of his sone ,
45001003	which is maad to hym of the seed of Dauid bi the flesch ,
45001004	and he was bifor ordeyned the sone of God in vertu , bi the spirit of halewyng of the ayenrisyng of deed men , of Jhesu Crist oure Lord ,
45001005	bi whom we han resseyued grace and the office of apostle , to obeie to the feith in alle folkis for his name ,
45001006	among whiche ye ben also clepid of Jhesu Crist ,
45001007	to alle that ben at Rome , derlyngis of God , and clepid hooli , grace to you , and pees of God oure fadir , and of the Lord Jhesu Crist .
45001008	First Y do thankyngis to my God , bi Jhesu Crist , for alle you , for youre feith is schewid in al the world .
45001009	For God is a witnesse to me , to whom Y serue in my spirit , in the gospel of his sone ,
45001010	that with outen ceessyng Y make mynde of you euere in my preieris , and biseche , if in ony maner sum tyme Y haue a spedi weie in the wille of God to come to you .
45001011	For Y desire to se you , to parten sumwhat of spiritual grace ,
45001012	that ye be confermyd , that is , to be coumfortid togidere in you , bi feith that is bothe youre and myn togidere .
45001013	And , britheren , Y nyle , that ye vnknowun , that ofte Y purposide to come to you , and Y am lett to this tyme , that Y haue sum fruyt in you , as in othere folkis .
45001014	To Grekis and to barberyns , to wise men and to vnwise men ,
45001015	Y am dettour , so that that is in me is redi to preche the gospel also to you that ben at Rome .
45001016	For Y schame not the gospel , for it is the vertu of God in to heelthe to ech man that bileueth , to the Jew first , and to the Greke .
45001017	For the riytwisnesse of God is schewid in it , of feith in to feith ,
45001018	as it is writun , For a iust man lyueth of feith . For the wraththe of God is schewid fro heuene on al vnpite and wickidnesse of tho men , that withholden the treuthe of God in vnriytwisnes .
45001019	For that thing of God that is knowun , is schewid to hem , for God hath schewid to hem .
45001020	For the vnuysible thingis of hym , that ben vndurstondun , ben biholdun of the creature of the world , bi tho thingis that ben maad , yhe , and the euerlastynge vertu of hym and the godhed , so that thei mowe not be excusid .
45001021	For whanne thei hadden knowe God , thei glorifieden hym not as God , nether diden thankyngis ; but thei vanyschiden in her thouyts , and the vnwise herte of hem was derkid .
45001022	For thei ` seiynge that hem silf weren wise , thei weren maad foolis .
45001023	And thei chaungiden the glorie of ` God vncorruptible in to the licnesse of an ymage of a deedli man , and of briddis , and of foure footid beestis , and of serpentis .
45001024	For which thing God bitook hem in to the desiris of her herte , in to vnclennesse , that thei punysche with wrongis her bodies in hem silf .
45001025	The whiche chaungiden the treuthe of God in to leesyng , and herieden and serueden a creature rathere than to the creatoure , that is blessid in to worldis of worldis .
45001026	Amen . Therfor God bitook hem in to passiouns of schenschipe . For the wymmen of hem chaungiden the kyndli vss in to that vss that is ayens kynde .
45001027	Also the men forsoken the kyndli vss of womman , and brenneden in her desiris togidere , and men in to men wrouyten filthehed , and resseyueden in to hem silf the meede that bihofte of her errour .
45001028	And as thei preueden that thei hadden not God in knowyng , God bitook hem in to a repreuable wit , that thei do tho thingis that ben not couenable ; that thei ben fulfillid with al wickidnesse ,
45001029	malice , fornycacioun , coueitise , weiwardnesse , ful of enuye , mansleyngis , strijf , gile , yuel wille , preuy bacbiteris , detractouris ,
45001030	hateful to God , debateris , proude , and hiy ouer mesure , fynderis of yuele thingis , not obeschynge to fadir and modir ,
45001031	vnwise , vnmanerli , withouten loue , withouten boond of pees , with outen merci .
45001032	The whiche whanne thei hadden knowe the riytwisnesse of God , vndirstoden not , that thei that don siche thingis ben worthi the deth , not oneli thei that don tho thingis , but also thei that consenten to the doeris .
45002001	Wherfor thou art vnexcusable , ech man that demest , for in what thing thou demest anothir man , thou condempnest thi silf ; for thou doist the same thingis whiche thou demest .
45002002	And we witen , that the doom of God is aftir treuthe ayens hem , that don siche thingis .
45002003	But gessist thou , man , that demest hem that doen siche thingis , and thou doist tho thingis , that thou schalt ascape the doom of God ?
45002004	Whether ` dispisist thou the richessis of his goodnesse , and the pacience , and the long abidyng ? Knowist thou not , that the benygnyte of God ledith thee to forthenkyng ?
45002005	But aftir thin hardnesse and vnrepentaunt herte , thou tresorist to thee wraththe in the dai of wraththe and of schewyng of the riytful doom of God ,
45002006	that schal yelde to ech man aftir his werkis ;
45002007	sotheli to hem that ben bi pacience of good werk , glorie , and onour , and vncorrupcioun , to hem that seken euerlastynge lijf ;
45002008	but to hem that ben of strijf , and that assenten not to treuthe , but bileuen to wickidnesse , wraththe and indignacioun , tribulacioun and angwisch ,
45002009	in to ech soule of man that worchith yuel , to the Jew first , and to the Greke ;
45002010	but glorie , and honour , and pees , to ech man that worchith good thing , to the Jew first , and to the Greke .
45002011	For accepcioun of persones is not anentis God .
45002012	For who euere han synned without the lawe , schulen perische withouten the lawe ; and who euere han synned in the lawe , thei schulen be demyd bi the lawe .
45002013	For the hereris of lawe ben not iust anentis God , but the doeris of the lawe schulen be maad iust .
45002014	For whanne hethene men that han not lawe , don kyndli tho thingis that ben of the lawe , thei not hauynge suche manere lawe , ben lawe to hem silf ,
45002015	that schewen the werk of the lawe writun in her hertis . For the conscience of hem yeldith to hem a witnessyng bytwixe hem silf of thouytis that ben accusynge or defendynge ,
45002016	in the dai whanne God schal deme the priuy thingis of men aftir my gospel , bi Jhesu Crist .
45002017	But if thou art named a Jew , and restist in the lawe , and hast glorie in God ,
45002018	and hast knowe his wille , and thou lerud bi lawe preuest the more profitable thingis ,
45002019	and tristist thi silf to be a ledere of blynde men , the liyt of hem that ben in derknessis ,
45002020	a techere of vnwise men , a maistir of yonge children , that hast the foorme of kunnyng and of treuthe in the lawe ;
45002021	what thanne techist thou another , and techist not thi silf ? Thou that prechist that me schal not stele , stelist ?
45002022	Thou that techist that me schal ` do no letcherie , doist letcherie ? Thou that wlatist maumetis , doist sacrilegie ?
45002023	Thou that hast glorie in the lawe , vnworschipist God bi brekyng of the lawe ?
45002024	For the name of God is blasfemed bi you among hethene men , as is writun .
45002025	For circumcisioun profitith , if thou kepe the lawe ; but if thou be a trespassour ayens the lawe , thi circumsicioun is maad prepucie .
45002026	Therfor if prepucie kepe the riytwisnessis of the lawe , whethir his prepucie schal not be arettid in to circumcisioun ?
45002027	And the prepucie of kynde that fulfillith the lawe , schal deme thee , that bi lettre and circumcisioun art trespassour ayens the lawe .
45002028	For he that is in opene is not a Jew , nether it is circumsicioun that is openli in the fleisch ;
45002029	but he that is a Jew in hid , and the circumcisioun of herte , in spirit , not bi the lettre , whos preisyng is not of men , but of God .
45003001	What thanne is more to a Jew , or what profit of circumcisioun ?
45003002	Myche bi al wise ; first , for the spekyngis of God ` weren bitakun to hem .
45003003	And what if summe of hem bileueden not ? Whethir the vnbileue of hem hath auoidid the feith of God ?
45003004	God forbede . For God is sothefast , but ech man a liere ; as it is writun , That thou be iustified in thi wordis , and ouercome , whanne thou art demed .
45003005	But if oure wickidnesse comende the riytwisnesse of God , what shulen we seie ? Whether God is wickid , that bryngith in wraththe ?
45003006	Aftir man Y seie . God forbede . Ellis hou schal God deme this world ?
45003007	For if the treuthe of God hath aboundid in my lessyng , in to the glorie of hym , what yit am Y demed as a synner ?
45003008	And not as we ben blasfemed , and as summen seien that we seien , Do we yuele thingis , that gode thingis come . Whos dampnacioun is iust .
45003009	What thanne ? Passen we hem ? Nay ; for we han schewid bi skile , that alle bothe Jewis and Grekis ben vndur synne ,
45003010	as it is writun , For ther is no man iust ;
45003011	ther is no man vndurstondynge , nethir sekynge God .
45003012	Alle bowiden a wey , togidere thei ben maad vnprofitable ; ther is noon that doith good thing , there is noon ` til to oon .
45003013	The throte of hem is an opyn sepulcre ; with her tungis thei diden gilefuli ; the venym of snakis is vndur her lippis .
45003014	The mouth of whiche is ful of cursyng and bitternesse ;
45003015	the feet of hem ben swifte to schede blood .
45003016	Sorewe and cursidnesse ben in the weies of hem , and thei knewen not the weie of pees ;
45003017	
45003018	the drede of God is not bifor her iyen .
45003019	And we witen , that what euere thingis the lawe spekith , it spekith to hem that ben in the lawe , that ech mouth be stoppid , and ech world be maad suget to God .
45003020	For of the werkis of the lawe ech fleisch schal not be iustified bifor hym ; for bi the lawe ther is knowyng of synne .
45003021	But now with outen the lawe the riytwisnesse of God is schewid , that is witnessid of the lawe and the profetis .
45003022	And the riytwisnesse of God is bi the feith of Jhesu Crist in to alle men and on alle men that bileuen in hym ; for ther is no departyng .
45003023	For alle men synneden , and han nede to the glorie of God ;
45003024	and ben iustified freli bi his grace , bi the ayenbiyng that is in ` Crist Jhesu .
45003025	Whom God ordeynede foryyuer , bi feith in his blood , to the schewyng of his riytwisnesse , for remyssioun of biforgoynge synnes ,
45003026	in the beryng up of God , to the schewyng of his riytwisnesse in this tyme , that he be iust , and iustifyynge hym that is of the feith of Jhesu Crist .
45003027	Where thanne is thi gloriyng ? It is excludid . Bi what lawe ? Of dedis doyng ? Nay , but by the lawe of feith .
45003028	For we demen a man to be iustified bi the feith , with outen werkis of the lawe .
45003029	Whethir of Jewis is God oneli ? Whether he is not also of hethene men ? Yhis , and of hethene men .
45003030	For ` oon God is , that iustefieth circumcisioun bi feith , and prepucie bi feith .
45003031	Distruye we therfor the lawe bi the feith ? God forbede ; but we stablischen the lawe .
45004001	What thanne schulen we seie , that Abraham oure fadir aftir the flesch foond ?
45004002	For if Abraham is iustified of werkis of the lawe , he hath glorie , but not anentis God .
45004003	For what seith the scripture ? Abraham bileued to God , and it was arettid to him to riytwisnesse .
45004004	And to hym that worchith mede is not arettid bi grace , but bi dette .
45004005	Sotheli to hym that worchith not , but bileueth in to hym that iustefieth a wickid man , his feith is arettid to riytwisnesse , aftir the purpos of Goddis grace .
45004006	As Dauid seith the blessidnesse of a man , whom God acceptith , he yyueth to hym riytwisnesse with outen werkis of the lawe ,
45004007	Blessid ben thei , whos wickidnessis ben foryouun , and whos synnes ben hid .
45004008	Blessid is that man , to whom God arettide not synne .
45004009	Thanne whether dwellith this blisfulnesse oneli in circumcisioun , or also in prepucie ? For we seien , that the feith was arettid to Abraham to riytwisnesse .
45004010	Hou thanne was it arettid ? in circumcisioun , or in prepucie ? Not in circumcisioun , but in prepucie .
45004011	And he took a signe of circumcisioun , a tokenyng of riytwisnesse of the feith which is in prepucie , that he be fadir of alle men bileuynge bi prepucie , that it be arettid also to hem to riytwisnesse ;
45004012	and that he be fadir of circumcisioun , not onely to hem that ben of circumcisioun , but also to hem that suen the steppis of the feith , which feith is in prepucie of oure fader Abraham .
45004013	For not bi the lawe is biheest to Abraham , or to his seed , that he schulde be eir of the world , but bi the riytwisnesse of feith .
45004014	For if thei that ben of the lawe , ben eiris , feith is distried , biheest is don awey .
45004015	For the lawe worchith wraththe ; for where is no lawe , there is no trespas , nethir is trespassyng .
45004016	Therfor riytfulnesse is of the feith , that bi grace biheeste be stable to ech seed , not to that seed oneli that is of the lawe , but to that that is of the feith of Abraham , which is fadir of vs alle .
45004017	As it is writun , For Y haue set thee fadir of many folkis , bifor God to whom thou hast bileued . Which God quykeneth deed men , and clepith tho thingis that ben not , as tho that ben .
45004018	Which Abraham ayens hope bileuede in to hope , that he schulde be maad fader of many folkis , as it was seid to hym , Thus schal thi seed be , as the sterris of heuene , and as the grauel that is in the brenke of the see .
45004019	And he was not maad vnstidfast in the bileue , nether he biheelde his bodi thanne nyy deed , whanne he was almost of an hundrid yeer , ne the wombe of Sare nyy deed .
45004020	Also in the biheeste of God he doutide not with vntrist ; but he was coumfortid in bileue ,
45004021	yyuynge glorie to God , witynge moost fulli that what euere thingis God hath bihiyt , he is myyti also to do .
45004022	Therfor it was arettid to hym to riytwisnesse .
45004023	And it is not writun oneli for him , that it was arettid to hym to riytwisnesse ,
45004024	but also for vs , to whiche it schal be arettid , that bileuen in him that reiside oure Lord Jhesu Crist fro deeth .
45004025	Which was bitakun for oure synnes , and roos ayen for oure iustefiyng .
45005001	Therfor we , iustified of feith , haue we pees at God bi oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
45005002	Bi whom we han niy goyng to , bi feith in to this grace , in which we stonden , and han glorie in the hope of the glorie of Goddis children .
45005003	And not this oneli , but also we glorien in tribulaciouns , witynge that tribulacioun worchith pacience ,
45005004	and pacience preuyng , and preuyng hope .
45005005	And hope confoundith not , for the charite of God is spred abrood in oure hertis bi the Hooli Goost , that is youun to vs .
45005006	And while that we weren sijk aftir the tyme , what diede Crist for wickid men ?
45005007	For vnnethis dieth ony man for the iust man ; and yit for a good man perauenture summan dar die .
45005008	But God comendith his charite in vs ; for if whanne we weren yit synneris ,
45005009	aftir the tyme Crist was deed for vs , thanne myche more now we iustified in his blood , schulen be saaf fro wraththe bi him .
45005010	For if whanne we weren enemyes , we ben recounselid to God bi the deth of his sone , myche more we recounselid schulen be saaf in the lijf of hym .
45005011	And not oneli this , but also we glorien in God , bi oure Lord Jhesu Crist , bi whom we han resseyued now recounseling .
45005012	Therfor as bi o man synne entride in to this world , and bi synne deth , and so deth passide forth in to alle men , in which man alle men synneden .
45005013	For ` til to the lawe synne was in the world ; but synne was not rettid , whanne lawe was not .
45005014	But deth regnyde from Adam ` til to Moises , also in to hem that synneden not in licnesse of the trespassyng of Adam , the which is licnesse of Crist to comynge .
45005015	But not as gilt , so the yifte ; for if thorouy the gilt of oon manye ben deed , myche more the grace of God and the yifte in the grace of o man Jhesu Crist hath aboundid in to many men .
45005016	And not as bi o synne , so bi the yifte ; for the doom of oon in to condempnacioun , but grace of many giltis in to iustificacioun .
45005017	For if in the gilt of oon deth regnede thorouy oon , myche more men that takyn plente of grace , and of yyuyng , and of riytwisnesse , schulen regne in lijf bi oon Jhesu Crist .
45005018	Therfor as bi the gilt of oon in to alle men in to condempnacioun , so bi the riytwisnesse of oon in to alle men in to iustifiyng of lijf .
45005019	For as bi inobedience of o man manye ben maad synneris , so bi the obedience of oon manye schulen be iust .
45005020	And the lawe entride , that gilt schulde be plenteuouse ; but where gilt was plenteuouse ,
45005021	grace was more plenteuouse . That as synne regnede in to deth , so grace regne bi riytwisnesse in to euerlastynge lijf , bi ` Crist Jhesu oure Lord .
45006001	Therfor what schulen we seie ? Schulen we dwelle in synne , that grace be plenteuouse ?
45006002	God forbede . For hou schulen we that ben deed to synne , lyue yit ther ynne ?
45006003	Whether , britheren , ye knowen not , that whiche euere we ben baptisid in Crist Jhesu , we ben baptisid in his deth ?
45006004	For we ben togidere biried with hym bi baptym ` in to deth ; that as Crist aroos fro deth bi the glorie of the fadir , so walke we in a newnesse of lijf .
45006005	For if we plauntid togidere ben maad to the licnesse of his deth , also we schulen be of the licnesse of his risyng ayen ;
45006006	witynge this thing , that oure olde man is crucified togidere , that the bodi of synne be distruyed , that we serue no more to synne .
45006007	For he that is deed , is iustefied fro synne .
45006008	And if we ben deed with Crist , we bileuen that also we schulen lyue togidere with hym ;
45006009	witinge for Crist , rysynge ayen fro deth , now dieth not , deeth schal no more haue lordschip on hym .
45006010	For that he was deed to synne , he was deed onys ; but that he lyueth , he liueth to God .
45006011	So ye deme you silf to be deed to synne , but lyuynge to God in ` Jhesu Crist oure Lord .
45006012	Therfor regne not synne in youre deedli bodi , that ye obeische to hise coueityngis .
45006013	Nether yyue ye youre membris armuris of wickidnesse to synne , but yyue ye you silf to God , as thei that lyuen of deed men , and youre membris armuris of riytwisnesse to God .
45006014	For synne schal not haue lordschipe on you ; for ye ben not vndur the lawe , but vndur grace .
45006015	What therfor ? Schulen we do synne , for we ben not vndur the lawe , but vndur grace ?
45006016	God forbede . Witen ye not , that to whom ye yyuen you seruauntis to obeie to , ye ben seruauntis of that thing , to which ye han obeschid , ether of synne to deth , ether of obedience to riytwisnesse ?
45006017	But Y thanke God , that ye weren seruauntis of synne ; but ye han obeischid of herte in to that fourme of techyng , in which ye ben bitakun .
45006018	And ye delyuered fro synne , ben maad seruauntis of riytwisnesse .
45006019	Y seie that thing that is of man , for the vnstidefastnesse of youre fleisch . But as ye han youun youre membris to serue to vnclennesse , and to wickidnesse ` in to wickidnesse , so now yyue ye youre membris to serue to riytwisnesse in to hoolynesse .
45006020	For whanne ye weren seruauntis of synne , ye weren fre of riytfulnesse .
45006021	Therfor what fruyt hadden ye thanne in tho thingis , in whiche ye schamen now ? For the ende of hem is deth .
45006022	But now ye delyuered fro synne , and maad seruauntis to God , han your fruyt in to holinesse , and the ende euerlastinge lijf .
45006023	For the wagis of synne is deth ; the grace of God is euerlastynge lijf in Crist Jhesu our Lord .
45007001	Britheren , whethir ye knowun not ; for Y speke to men ` that knowen the lawe ; for the lawe hath lordschip in a man , as long tyme as it lyueth ?
45007002	For that womman that is vndur an hosebonde , is boundun to the lawe , while the hosebonde lyueth ; but if hir hosebonde is deed , sche is delyuered fro the lawe of the hosebonde .
45007003	Therfor sche schal be clepid auoutresse , if sche be with another man , while the hosebonde lyueth ; but if hir hosebonde is deed , sche is delyuered fro the lawe of the hosebonde , that sche be not auoutresse , if sche be with another man .
45007004	And so , my britheren , ye ben maad deed to the lawe bi the bodi of Crist , that ye ben of another , that roos ayen fro deth , that ye bere fruyt to God .
45007005	For whanne we weren in fleisch , passiouns of synnes , that weren bi the lawe , wrouyten in oure membris , to bere fruyt to deth .
45007006	But now we ben vnboundun fro the lawe of deth , in which we weren holdun , so that we seruen in newnesse of spirit , and not in eldnesse of lettre .
45007007	What therfor schulen we seie ? The lawe is synne ? God forbede . But Y knew not synne , but bi lawe ; for Y wiste not that coueitynge was synne , but for the lawe seide , Thou schalt not coueyte .
45007008	And thoruy occasioun takun , synne bi the maundement hath wrouyt in me al coueytise ; for withouten the lawe , synne was deed .
45007009	And Y lyuede withouten the lawe sumtyme ; but whanne the comaundement was comun , synne lyuede ayen .
45007010	But Y was deed , and this comaundement that was to lijf , was foundun to me , to be to deth .
45007011	For synne , thorouy occasioun takun bi the comaundement , disceyuede me , and bi that it slow me .
45007012	Therfor the lawe is hooli , and the comaundement is hooli , and iust , and good .
45007013	Is thanne that thing that is good , maad deth to me ? God forbede . But synne , that it seme synne , thorouy good thing wrouyte deth to me , that me synne ouer maner thorouy the comaundement .
45007014	And we witen , that the lawe is spiritual ; but Y am fleischli , seld vndur synne .
45007015	For Y vndurstonde not that that Y worche ; for Y do not the good thing that Y wole , but Y do thilke yuel thing that Y hate .
45007016	And if Y do that thing that Y wole not , Y consente to the lawe , that it is good .
45007017	But now Y worche not it now , but the synne that dwellith in me .
45007018	But and Y woot , that in me , that is , in my fleisch , dwellith no good ; for wille lieth to me , but Y fynde not to performe good thing .
45007019	For Y do not thilke good thing that Y wole , but Y do thilke yuel thing that Y wole not .
45007020	And if Y do that yuel thing that Y wole not , Y worche not it , but the synne that dwellith in me .
45007021	Therfor Y fynde the lawe to me willynge to do good thing , for yuel thing lieth to me .
45007022	For Y delite togidere to the lawe of God , aftir the ynnere man . But Y se another lawe in my membris ,
45007023	ayenfiytynge the lawe of my soule , and makynge me caitif in the lawe of synne , that is in my membris .
45007024	Y am an vnceli man ; who schal delyuer me fro the bodi of this synne ?
45007025	The grace of God , bi Jhesu Crist oure Lord . Therfor Y my silf bi the soule serue to the lawe of God ; but bi fleisch to the lawe of synne .
45008001	Therfor now no thing of dampnacioun is to hem that ben in Crist Jhesu , whiche wandren not after the flesch .
45008002	For the lawe of the spirit of lijf in Crist Jhesu hath delyuerid me fro the lawe of synne , and of deth .
45008003	For that that was vnpossible to the lawe , in what thing it was sijk bi flesch , God sente his sone in to the licknesse of fleisch of synne , and of synne dampnede synne in fleisch ;
45008004	that the iustefiyng of the lawe were fulfillid in vs , that goen not aftir the fleisch , but aftir the spirit .
45008005	For thei that ben aftir the fleisch , saueren tho thingis that ben of the fleisch ; but thei that ben after the spirit , feelen tho thingis that ben of the spirit . For the prudence of fleisch is deth ;
45008006	but the prudence of spirit is lijf and pees .
45008007	For the wisdom of the fleisch is enemye to God ; for it is not suget to the lawe of God , for nether it may .
45008008	And thei that ben in fleisch , moun not plese to God .
45008009	But ye ben not in fleisch , but in spirit ; if netheles the spirit of God dwellith in you . But if ony hath not the spirit of Crist , this is not his .
45008010	For if Crist is in you , the bodi is deed for synne , but the spirit lyueth for iustefiyng .
45008011	And if the spirit of hym that reiside Jhesu Crist fro deth dwellith in you , he that reiside Jhesu Crist fro deth , shal quykene also youre deedli bodies , for the spirit of hym that dwellith in you .
45008012	Therfor , britheren , we ben dettouris , not to the flesch , that we lyuen aftir the flesch .
45008013	For if ye lyuen aftir the fleisch , ye schulen die ; but if ye bi the spirit sleen the dedis of the fleisch , ye schulen lyue .
45008014	For who euere ben led bi the spirit of God , these ben the sones of God .
45008015	For ye han not take eftsoone the spirit of seruage in drede , but ye han taken the spirit of adopcioun of sones , in which we crien , Abba , fadir .
45008016	And the ilke spirit yeldith witnessyng to oure spirit , that we ben the sones of God ;
45008017	if sones , and eiris , ` and eiris of God , and eiris togidere with Crist ; if netheles we suffren togidere , that also we ben glorified togidere .
45008018	And Y deme , that the passiouns of this tyme ben not worthi to the glorie to comynge , that schal be schewid in vs .
45008019	For the abidyng of creature abidith the schewyng of the sones of God .
45008020	But the creature is suget to vanyte , not willynge , but for hym that made it suget in hope ;
45008021	for the ilke creature schal be delyuered fro seruage of corrupcioun in to liberte of the glorie of the sones of God .
45008022	And we witen , that ech creature sorewith , and trauelith with peyne til yit .
45008023	And not oneli it , but also we vs silf , that han the first fruytis of the spirit , and we vs silf sorewen with ynne vs for the adopcioun of Goddis sonys , abidynge the ayenbiyng of oure bodi .
45008024	But bi hope we ben maad saaf . For hope that is seyn , is not hope ; for who hopith that thing , that he seeth ?
45008025	And if we hopen that thing that we seen not , we abiden bi pacience .
45008026	And also the spirit helpith oure infirmyte ; for what we schulen preie , as it bihoueth , we witen not , but the ilke spirit axith for vs with sorewyngis , that moun not be teld out .
45008027	For he that sekith the hertis , woot what the spirit desirith , for bi God he axith for hooli men .
45008028	And we witen , that to men ` that louen God , alle thingis worchen togidere in to good , to hem that aftir purpos ben clepid seyntis .
45008029	For thilke that he knewe bifor , he bifor ordenede bi grace to be maad lijk to the ymage of his sone , that he be the first bigetun among many britheren .
45008030	And thilke that he bifore ordeynede to blis , hem he clepide ; and whiche he clepide , hem he iustifiede ; and whiche he iustifiede , and hem he glorifiede .
45008031	What thanne schulen we seie to these thingis ? If God for vs , who is ayens vs ?
45008032	The which also sparide not his owne sone , but ` for vs alle bitook hym , hou also yaf he not to vs alle thingis with hym ?
45008033	Who schal accuse ayens the chosun men of God ? It is God that iustifieth ,
45008034	who is it that condempneth ? It is Jhesus Crist that was deed , yhe , the which roos ayen , the which is on the riyt half of God , and the which preieth for vs .
45008035	Who thanne schal departe vs fro the charite of Crist ? tribulacioun , or anguysch , or hungur , or nakidnesse , or persecucioun , or perel , or swerd ?
45008036	As it is writun , For we ben slayn al dai for thee ; we ben gessid as scheep of slauytir .
45008037	But in alle these thingis we ouercomen , for hym that louyde vs .
45008038	But Y am certeyn , that nethir deeth , nether lijf , nether aungels , nethir principatus , nether vertues , nether present thingis , nether thingis to comynge , nether strengthe ,
45008039	nether heiyth , nether depnesse , nether noon othir creature may departe vs fro the charite of God , that is in ` Crist Jhesu oure Lord .
45009001	I seie treuthe in Crist Jhesu , Y lye not , for my conscience berith witnessyng to me in the Hooli Goost ,
45009002	for greet heuynesse is to me , and contynuel sorewe to my herte .
45009003	For Y my silf desiride to be departid fro Crist for my britheren , that ben my cosyns aftir the fleisch , that ben men of Israel ;
45009004	whos is adopcioun of sones , and glorie , and testament , and yyuyng of the lawe , and seruyce , and biheestis ;
45009005	whos ben the fadris , and of which is Crist after the fleisch , that is God aboue alle thingis , blessid in to worldis .
45009006	Amen . But not that the word of God hath falle doun . For not alle that ben of Israel , these ben Israelitis .
45009007	Nethir thei that ben seed of Abraham , ` alle ben sonys ; but in Ysaac the seed schal be clepid to thee ;
45009008	that is to seie , not thei that ben sones of the fleisch , ben sones of God , but thei that ben sones of biheeste ben demed in the seed .
45009009	For whi this is the word of biheest , Aftir this tyme Y schal come , and a sone schal be to Sare .
45009010	And not oneli sche , but also Rebecca hadde twey sones of o liggyng bi of Ysaac , oure fadir .
45009011	And whanne thei weren not yit borun , nether hadden don ony thing of good ether of yuel , that the purpos of God schulde dwelle bi eleccioun ,
45009012	not of werkis , but of God clepynge , it was seid to hym ,
45009013	that the more schulde serue the lesse , as it is writun , Y louede Jacob , but Y hatide Esau .
45009014	What therfor schulen we seie ? Whether wickidnesse be anentis God ?
45009015	God forbede . For he seith to Moyses , Y schal haue merci on whom Y haue merci ; and Y schal yyue merci on whom Y schal haue merci .
45009016	Therfor it is not nether of man willynge , nethir rennynge , but of God hauynge mercy .
45009017	And the scripture seith to Farao , For to this thing Y haue stirid thee , that Y schewe in thee my vertu , and that my name be teld in al erthe .
45009018	Therfor of whom God wole , he hath merci ; and whom he wole , he endurith .
45009019	Thanne seist thou to me , What is souyt yit ? for who withstondith his wille ?
45009020	O ! man , who art thou , that answerist to God ? Whether a maad thing seith to hym that made it , What hast thou maad me so ?
45009021	Whether a potter of cley hath not power to make of the same gobet o vessel in to honour , an othere in to dispit ?
45009022	That if God willynge to schewe his wraththe , and to make his power knowun , hath suffrid in greet pacience vessels of wraththe able in to deth ,
45009023	to schewe the riytchessis of his glorie in to vessels of merci , whiche he made redi in to glorie .
45009024	Whiche also he clepide not oneli of Jewis , but also of hethene men , as he seith in Osee ,
45009025	Y schal clepe not my puple my puple , and not my loued my louyd , and not getynge mercy getynge merci ;
45009026	and it schal be in the place , where it is seid to hem , Not ye my puple , there thei schulen be clepid the sones of ` God lyuynge .
45009027	But Isaye crieth for Israel , If the noumbre of Israel schal be as grauel of the see , the relifs schulen be maad saaf .
45009028	Forsothe a word makynge an ende , and abreggynge in equyte , for the Lord schal make a word breggid on al the erthe .
45009029	And as Ysaye bifor seide , But God of oostis hadde left to vs seed , we hadden be maad as Sodom , and we hadden be lijk as Gommor .
45009030	Therfor what schulen we seie ? That hethene men that sueden not riytwisnesse , han gete riytwisnesse , yhe , the riytwisnesse that is of feith .
45009031	But Israel suynge the lawe of riytwisnesse , cam not parfitli in to the lawe of riytwisnesse .
45009032	Whi ? For not of feith , but as of werkys . And thei spurneden ayens the stoon of offencioun ,
45009033	as it is writun , Lo ! Y putte a stoon of offensioun in Syon , and a stoon of sclaundre ; and ech that schal bileue ` in it , schal not be confoundid .
45010001	Britheren , the wille of myn herte and mi biseching is maad to God for hem in to helthe .
45010002	But Y bere witnessyng to hem , that thei han loue of God , but not aftir kunnyng .
45010003	For thei vnknowynge Goddis riytwisnesse , and sekynge to make stidefast her owne riytfulnesse , ben not suget to the riytwisnesse of God .
45010004	For the ende of the lawe is Crist , to riytwisnesse to ech man that bileueth .
45010005	For Moises wroot , For the man that schal do riytwisnesse that is of the lawe , schal lyue in it .
45010006	But the riytwisnesse that is of bileue , seith thus , Seie thou not in thin herte , Who schal stie in to heuene ? that is to seie , to lede doun Crist ;
45010007	or who schal go doun in to helle ? that is , to ayenclepe Crist fro deth .
45010008	But what seith the scripture ? The word is nyy in thi mouth , and in thin herte ; this is the word of bileue , which we prechen .
45010009	That if thou knoulechist in thi mouth the Lord Jhesu Crist , and bileuest in thin herte , that God reiside hym fro deth , thou schalt be saaf .
45010010	For bi herte me bileueth to riytwisnesse , but bi mouth knowleching is maad to helthe .
45010011	For whi the scripture seith , Ech that bileueth in hym , schal not be confoundid .
45010012	And ther is no distinccioun of Jew and of Greke ; for the same Lord of alle is riche in alle , that inwardli clepen hym .
45010013	For ech man ` who euere schal inwardli clepe the name of the Lord , schal be saaf .
45010014	Hou thanne schulen thei inwardli clepe hym , in to whom thei han not bileued ? or hou schulen thei bileue to hym , whom thei han not herd ? Hou schulen thei here , with outen a prechour ?
45010015	and hou schulen thei preche , but thei be sent ? As it is writun , Hou faire ben the feet of hem that prechen pees , of hem that prechen good thingis .
45010016	But not alle men obeien to the gospel . For Ysaie seith , Lord , who bileuede to oure heryng ?
45010017	Therfor feith is of heryng , but heryng bi the word of Crist .
45010018	But Y seie , Whether thei herden not ? Yhis , sothely the word of hem wente out in to al the erthe , and her wordis in to the endis of the world .
45010019	But Y seie , Whether Israel knewe not ? First Moyses seith , Y schal lede you to enuye , that ye ben no folc ; that ye ben an vnwise folc , Y schal sende you in to wraththe .
45010020	And Ysaie is bold , and seith , Y am foundun of men that seken me not ; opynli Y apperide to hem , that axiden not me .
45010021	But to Israel he seith , Al dai Y streiyte out myn hondis to a puple that bileuede not , but ayen seide me .
45011001	Therfor Y seie , Whether God hath put awei his puple ? God forbede . For Y am an Israelite , of the seed of Abraham , of the lynage of Beniamyn .
45011002	God hath not put awei his puple , which he bifor knew . Whether ye witen not , what the scripture seith in Elie ? Hou he preieth God ayens Israel ,
45011003	Lord , thei han slayn thi prophetis , thei han vndurdoluun thin auteris , and Y am lefte aloone , and thei seken my lijf .
45011004	But what seith Goddis answere to hym ? Y haue left to me seuene thousyndes of men , that han not bowid her knees bifore Baal .
45011005	So therfor also in this tyme , the relifs ben maad saaf , bi the chesyng of the grace of God .
45011006	And if it be bi the grace of God , it is not now of werkis ; ellis grace is not now grace .
45011007	What thanne ? Israel hath not getun this that he souyte , but eleccioun hath getun ; and the othere ben blyndid .
45011008	As it is writun , God yaf to hem a spirit of compunccioun , iyen that thei se not , and eeris , that thei here not , in to this dai .
45011009	And Dauith seith , Be the boord of hem maad in to a gryn bifor hem , and in to catchyng , and in to sclaundre , and in to yeldyng to hem .
45011010	Be the iyen of hem maad derk , that thei se not ; and bowe thou doun algatis the bak of hem .
45011011	Therfor Y seie , Whether thei offendiden so , that thei schulden falle doun ? God forbede . But bi the gilt of hem helthe is maad to hethene men , that thei sue hem .
45011012	That if the gilt of hem ben richessis of the world , and the makyng lesse of hem ben richessis of hethene men , hou myche more the plente of hem ?
45011013	But Y seie to you , hethene men , for as longe as Y am apostle of hethene men , Y schal onoure my mynysterie ,
45011014	if in ony maner Y stire my fleisch for to folowe , and that Y make summe of hem saaf .
45011015	For if the loss of hem is the recouncelyng of the world , what is the takyng vp , but lijf of deede men ?
45011016	For if a litil part of that that is tastid be hooli , the hool gobet is hooli ; and if the roote is hooli , also the braunchis .
45011017	What if ony of the braunchis ben brokun , whanne thou were a wielde olyue tre , art graffid among hem , and art maad felowe of the roote , and of the fatnesse of the olyue tre ,
45011018	nyle thou haue glorie ayens the braunchis . For if thou gloriest , thou berist not the roote , but the roote thee .
45011019	Therfor thou seist , The braunchis ben brokun , that Y be graffid in .
45011020	Wel , for vnbileue the braunchis ben brokun ; but thou stondist bi feith . Nyle thou sauere hiye thing ,
45011021	but drede thou , for if God sparide not the kyndli braunchis , lest perauenture he spare not thee .
45011022	Therfor se the goodnesse , and the fersnesse of God ; yhe , the feersnesse in to hem that felden doun , but the goodnesse of God in to thee , if thou dwellist in goodnesse , ellis also thou schalt be kit doun .
45011023	Yhe , and thei schulen be set yn , if thei dwellen not in vnbileue . For God is myyti , to sette hem in eftsoone .
45011024	For if thou art kit doun of the kyndeli wielde olyue tre , and ayens kynd art set in to a good olyue tre , hou myche more thei that ben bi kynde , schulen be set in her olyue tree ?
45011025	But , britheren , Y wole not that ye vnknowen this mysterie , that ye be not wise to you silf ; for blyndenesse hath feld a parti in Israel , til that the plente of hethene men entride ,
45011026	and so al Israel schulde be maad saaf . As it is writun , He schal come of Syon , that schal delyuere , and turne awei the wickidnesse of Jacob .
45011027	And this testament to hem of me , whanne Y schal do awei her synnes .
45011028	Aftir the gospel thei ben enemyes for you , but thei ben moost dereworthe bi the eleccioun for the fadris .
45011029	And the yiftis and the cleping of God ben with outen forthenkyng .
45011030	And as sum tyme also ye bileueden not to God , but now ye han gete mercy for the vnbileue of hem ;
45011031	so and these now bileueden not in to youre merci , that also thei geten merci .
45011032	For God closide alle thingis togidere in vnbileue , that he haue mercy on alle .
45011033	O ! the heiynesse of the ritchessis of the wisdom and of the kunnyng of God ; hou incomprehensible ben hise domes , and hise weies ben vnserchable .
45011034	For whi who knew the wit of the Lord , or who was his counselour ? or who formere yaf to hym ,
45011035	and it schal be quyt to hym ?
45011036	For of hym , and bi hym , and in hym ben alle thingis . To hym be glorie in to worldis . Amen .
45012001	Therfore , britheren , Y biseche you bi the mercy of God , that ye yyue youre bodies a lyuynge sacrifice , hooli , plesynge to God , and youre seruyse resonable .
45012002	And nyle ye be confourmyd to this world , but be ye reformed in newnesse of youre wit , that ye preue which is the wille of God , good , and wel plesynge , and parfit .
45012003	For Y seie , bi the grace that is youun to me , to alle that ben among you , that ye sauere no more than it bihoueth to sauere , but for to sauere to sobrenesse ; and to ech man , as God hath departid the mesure of feith .
45012004	For as in o bodi we han many membris , but alle the membris han not the same dede ;
45012005	so we many ben o bodi in Crist , and eche ben membris oon of anothir .
45012006	Therfor we that han yiftis dyuersynge , aftir the grace that is youun to vs ,
45012007	ethir prophecie , aftir the resoun of feith ; ethir seruise , in mynystryng ; ether he that techith , in techyng ;
45012008	he that stirith softli , in monestyng ; he that yyueth , in symplenesse ; he that is souereyn , in bisynesse ; he that hath merci , in gladnesse .
45012009	Loue with outen feynyng , hatynge yuel , drawynge to good ;
45012010	louynge togidere the charite of britherhod . Eche come bifore to worschipen othere ;
45012011	not slow in bisynesse , feruent in spirit , seruynge to the Lord ,
45012012	ioiynge in hope , pacient in tribulacioun , bisy in preier ,
45012013	yyuynge good to the nedis of seyntis , kepynge hospitalite .
45012014	Blesse ye men that pursuen you ; blesse ye , and nyle ye curse ;
45012015	for to ioye with men that ioyen , for to wepe with men that wepen .
45012016	Fele ye the same thing togidere ; not sauerynge heiy thingis , but consentynge to meke thingis . Nile ye be prudent anentis you silf ;
45012017	to no man yeldynge yuel for yuel , but purueye ye good thingis , not oneli bifor God , but also bifor alle men .
45012018	If it may be don , that that is of you , haue ye pees with alle men .
45012019	Ye moost dere britheren , not defendynge you silf , but yyue ye place to wraththe ; for it is writun , The Lord seith , To me veniaunce , and Y schal yelde .
45012020	But if thin enemy hungrith , fede thou hym ; if he thirstith , yyue thou drynke to hym ; for thou doynge this thing schalt gidere togidere colis on his heed .
45012021	Nyle thou be ouercomun of yuel , but ouercome thou yuel bi good .
45013001	Euery soule be suget to heiyere powers . For ther is no power but of God , and tho thingis that ben of God , ben ordeyned .
45013002	Therfor he that ayenstondith power , ayenstondith the ordynaunce of God ; and thei that ayenstonden , geten to hem silf dampnacioun .
45013003	For princes ben not to the drede of good work , but of yuel . But wilt thou , that thou drede not power ? Do thou good thing , and thou schalt haue preisyng of it ;
45013004	for he is the mynystre of God to thee in to good . But if thou doist yuel , drede thou ; for not with outen cause he berith the swerd , for he is the mynystre of God , vengere in to wraththe to hym that doith yuel .
45013005	And therfor bi nede be ye suget , not oneli for wraththe , but also for conscience .
45013006	For therfor ye yyuen tributis , thei ben the mynystris of God , and seruen for this same thing .
45013007	Therfor yelde ye to alle men dettis , to whom tribut , tribut , to whom tol , tol , to whom drede , drede , to whom onour , onour .
45013008	To no man owe ye ony thing , but that ye loue togidere . For he that loueth his neiybore , hath fulfillid the lawe .
45013009	For , Thou schalt do no letcherie , Thou schalt not sle , Thou schalt not stele , Thou schalt not seie fals witnessyng , Thou schalt not coueyte the thing of thi neiybore , and if ther be ony othere maundement , it is instorid in this word , Thou schalt loue thi neiybore as thi silf .
45013010	The loue of neiybore worchith not yuel ; therfor loue is the fulfillyng of the lawe .
45013011	And we knowen this tyme , that the our is now , that we rise fro sleep ; for now oure heelthe is neer , than whanne we bileueden .
45013012	The nyyt wente bifore , but the dai hath neiyed . Therfor caste we awei the werkis of derknessis , and be we clothid in the armeris of liyt .
45013013	As in dai wandre we onestli , not in superflu feestis and drunkenessis , not in beddis and vnchastitees , not in strijf and in enuye ;
45013014	but be ye clothid in the Lord Jhesu Crist , and do ye not the bisynesse of fleisch in desiris .
45014001	But take ye a sijk man in bileue , not in demyngis of thouytis .
45014002	For another man leueth , that he mai ete alle thingis ; but he that is sijk , ete wortis .
45014003	He that etith , dispise not hym that etith not ; and he that etith not , deme not hym that etith . For God hath take him to hym .
45014004	Who art thou , that demest anothris seruaunt ? To his lord he stondith , or fallith fro hym . But he schal stonde ; for the Lord is myyti to make hym parfit .
45014005	For whi oon demeth a day bitwixe a dai , another demeth ech dai .
45014006	Ech man encrees in his wit . He that vnderstondith the dai , vnderstondith to the Lord . And he that etith , etith to the Lord , for he doith thankyngis to God . And he that etith not , etith not to the Lord , and doith thankyngis to God .
45014007	For no man of vs lyueth to hymsilf , and no man dieth to hymself .
45014008	For whether we lyuen , we lyuen to the Lord ; and whethir we dien , we dien to the Lord . Therfor whethir we lyuen or dien , we ben of the Lord .
45014009	For whi for this thing Crist was deed , and roos ayen , that he be Lord bothe of quyke and of deed men .
45014010	But what demest thou thi brothir ? or whi dispisist thou thi brothir ? for alle we schulen stonde bifore the trone of Crist .
45014011	For it is writun , Y lyue , seith the Lord , for to me ech kne schal be bowid , and ech tunge schal knouleche to God .
45014012	Therfor ech of vs schal yelde resoun to God for hym silf .
45014013	Therfor ` no more deme we ech other ; but more deme ye this thing , that ye putte not hirtyng , or sclaundre , to a brothir .
45014014	I woot and triste in the Lord Jhesu , that no thing is vnclene bi hym , no but to him that demeth ony thing to be vnclene , to him it is vnclene .
45014015	And if thi brother be maad sori in conscience for mete , now thou walkist not aftir charite . Nyle thou thorouy thi mete lese hym , for whom Crist diede .
45014016	Therfor be not oure good thing blasfemed .
45014017	For whi the rewme of God is not mete and drynk , but riytwisnesse and pees and ioye in the Hooli Goost .
45014018	And he that in this thing serueth Crist , plesith God , and is proued to men .
45014019	Therfor sue we tho thingis that ben of pees , and kepe we togidere ` tho thingis that ben of edificacioun .
45014020	Nyle thou for mete distrie the werk of God . For alle thingis ben clene , but it is yuel to the man that etith bi offendyng .
45014021	It is good to not ete fleisch , and to not drynke wyn , nethir in what thing thi brother offendith , or is sclaundrid , or is maad sijk .
45014022	Thou hast feith anentis thi silf , haue thou bifore God . Blessid is he that demeth not hym silf in that thing that he preueth .
45014023	For he that demeth , is dampned , if he etith ; for it is not of feith . And al thing that is not of feith , is synne .
45015001	But we saddere men owen to susteyne the feblenesses of sijke men , and not plese to vs silf .
45015002	Eche of vs plese to his neiybore in good , to edificacioun .
45015003	For Crist pleside not to hym silf , as it is writun , The repreues of men dispisynge thee , felden on me .
45015004	For what euere thingis ben writun , tho ben writun to oure techynge , that bi pacience and coumfort of scripturis we haue hope .
45015005	But God of pacience and of solace yyue to you to vndurstonde the same thing , ech in to othere aftir Jhesu Crist ,
45015006	that ye of o wille with o mouth worschipe God and the fadir of oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
45015007	For which thing take ye togidere , as also Crist took you in to the onour of God .
45015008	For Y seie , that Jhesu Crist was a mynystre of circumcisioun for the treuthe of God , to conferme the biheestis of fadris .
45015009	And hethene men owen to onoure God for merci ; as it is writun , Therfor , Lord , Y schal knowleche to thee among hethene men , and Y schal synge to thi name .
45015010	And eft he seith , Ye hethene men , be ye glad with his puple .
45015011	And eft , Alle hethene men , herie ye the Lord ; and alle puplis , magnefie ye hym .
45015012	And eft Isaie seith , Ther schal be a roote of Jesse , that schal rise vp to gouerne hethene men , and hethene men schulen hope in hym .
45015013	And God of hope fulfille you in al ioye and pees in bileuynge , that ye encrees in hope and vertu of the Hooli Goost .
45015014	And , britheren , Y my silf am certeyn of you , that also ye ben ful of loue , and ye ben fillid with al kunnyng , so that ye moun moneste ech other .
45015015	And , britheren , more boldli Y wroot to you a parti , as bryngynge you in to mynde , for the grace that is youun to me of God ,
45015016	that Y be the mynystre of Crist Jhesu among hethene men . And Y halewe the gospel of God , that the offryng of hethene men be acceptid , and halewid in the Hooli Goost .
45015017	Therfor Y haue glorie in Crist Jhesu to God .
45015018	For Y dar not speke ony thing of tho thingis , whiche Crist doith not bi me , in to obedience of hethene men , in word and dedis ,
45015019	in vertu of tokenes and grete wondris , in vertu of the Hooli Goost , so that fro Jerusalem bi cumpas to the Illirik see Y haue fillid the gospel of Crist .
45015020	And so Y haue prechid this gospel , not where Crist was named , lest Y bilde vpon anotheres ground , but as it is writun ,
45015021	For to whom it is not teld of him , thei schulen se , and thei that herden not , schulen vndurstonde .
45015022	For which thing Y was lettid ful myche to come to you , and Y am lettid to this tyme .
45015023	And now Y haue not ferthere place in these cuntrees , but Y haue desire to come to you , of many yeris that ben passid .
45015024	Whanne Y bygynne to passe in to Spayne , Y hope that in my goyng Y schal se you , and of you Y schal be led thidur , if Y vse you first in parti .
45015025	Therfor now Y schal passe forth to Jerusalem , to mynystre to seyntis .
45015026	For Macedonye and Acaie han assaied to make sum yifte to pore men of seyntis , that ben in Jerusalem .
45015027	For it pleside to hem , and thei ben dettouris of hem ; for hethene men ben maad parteneris of her goostli thingis , thei owen also in fleischli thingis to mynystre to hem .
45015028	Therfor whanne Y haue endid this thing , and haue asigned to hem this fruyt , Y schal passe bi you in to Spayne .
45015029	And Y woot , that Y comynge to you , schal come ` in to the abundaunce of the blessing of Crist .
45015030	Therfor , britheren , Y biseche you bi oure Lord Jhesu Crist , and bi charite of the Hooli Goost , that ye helpe me in youre preyeris to the Lord ,
45015031	that Y be delyuerid fro the vnfeithful men , that ben in Judee , and that the offryng of my seruyce be acceptid in Jerusalem to seyntis ;
45015032	that Y come to you in ioye , bi the wille of God , and that Y be refreischid with you .
45015033	And God of pees be with you alle . Amen .
45016001	And Y comende to you Feben , oure sister , which is in the seruyce of the chirche that is at Teucris ,
45016002	that ye resseyue hir in the Lord worthili to seyntis , and ` that ye helpe hir in what euere cause sche schal nede of you . For sche helpide many men , and my silf .
45016003	Grete ye Prisca and Aquyla , myn helperis in Crist Jhesu ,
45016004	which vndurputtiden her neckis for my lijf ; to whiche not Y aloone do thankyngis , but also alle the chirchis of hethene men .
45016005	And grete ye wel her meyneal chirche . Grete wel Efenete , louyd to me , that is the firste of Asie in Crist Jhesu .
45016006	Grete wel Marie , the whiche hath trauelid myche in vs .
45016007	Grete wel Andronyk and Julian , my cosyns , and myn euen prisouneris , which ben noble among the apostlis , and whiche weren bifor me in Crist .
45016008	Grete wel Ampliate , most dereworth to me in the Lord .
45016009	Grete wel Vrban , oure helpere in Crist Jhesus , and Stacchen , my derlyng .
45016010	Grete wel Appellem , the noble in Crist .
45016011	Grete wel hem that ben of Aristoblis hous . Grete wel Erodion , my cosyn . Grete wel hem that ben of Narciscies hous , that ben in the Lord .
45016012	Grete wel Trifenam and Trifosam , whiche wymmen trauelen in the Lord . Grete wel Persida , most dereworthe womman , that hath trauelid myche in the Lord .
45016013	Grete wel Rufus , chosun in the Lord , and his modir , and myn .
45016014	Grete wel Ansicrete , Flegoncia , Hermen , Patroban , Herman , and britheren that ben with hem .
45016015	Grete wel Filologus , and Julian , and Nereum , and his sistir , and Olympiades , and alle the seyntis that ben with hem .
45016016	Grete ye wel togidere in hooli coss . Alle the chirches of Crist greten you wel .
45016017	But , britheren , Y preye you , that ye aspie hem that maken discenciouns and hirtyngis , bisidis the doctryne that ye han lerned , and bowe ye awei fro hem .
45016018	For suche men seruen not to the Lord Crist , but to her wombe , and bi swete wordis and blessyngis disseyuen the hertis of innocent men .
45016019	But youre obedience is pupplischid in to euery place , therfor Y haue ioye in you . But Y wole that ye be wise in good thing , and symple in yuel .
45016020	And God of pees tredde Sathanas vndur youre feet swiftli . The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with you .
45016021	Tymothe , myn helpere , gretith you wel , and also Lucius , and Jason , and Sosipater , my cosyns .
45016022	Y Tercius grete you wel , that wroot this epistle , in the Lord .
45016023	Gayus , myn oost , gretith you wel , and al the chirche . Erastus , tresorere of the city , gretith you wel , and Quartus brother .
45016024	The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with you alle .
45016025	Amen . And onour and glorie be to hym , that is myyti to conferme you bi my gospel , and prechyng of Jhesu Crist , bi the reuelacioun of mysterie holdun stylle in tymes euerlastinge ;
45016026	which mysterie is now maad opyn bi scripturis of prophetis , bi the comaundement of God with outen bigynnyng and endyng , to the obedience of feith in alle hethene men , the mysterie
45016027	knowun bi Jhesu Crist to God aloone wiss , to whom be onour and glorie in to worldis of worldis . Amen .
46001001	Poul , clepid apostle of Jhesu Crist , bi the wille of God , and Sostenes , brothir , to the chirche of God that is at Corynthe ,
46001002	to hem that ben halewid in Crist Jhesu , and clepid seyntis , with alle that inwardli clepen the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , in ech place of hem and of oure ,
46001003	grace to you and pees of God , oure fadir , and of the Lord Jhesu Crist .
46001004	Y do thankyngis to my God eueremore for you , in the grace of God that is youun to you in Crist Jhesu .
46001005	For in alle thingis ye ben maad riche in hym , in ech word , and in ech kunnyng ,
46001006	as the witnessyng of Crist is confermyd in you ;
46001007	so that no thing faile to you in ony grace , that abiden the schewyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist ;
46001008	which also schal conferme you in to the ende with outen cryme , in the dai of the comyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
46001009	` A trewe God , bi whom ye ben clepid in to the felouschipe of his sone Jhesu Crist oure Lord .
46001010	But , britheren , Y biseche you , bi the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , that ye alle seie the same thing , and that dissenciouns be not among you ; but be ye perfit in the same wit , and in the same kunnyng .
46001011	For , my britheren , it is teld to me of hem that ben at Cloes , that stryues ben among you .
46001012	And Y seie that , that ech of you seith , For Y am of Poul , and Y am of Apollo , and Y am of Cefas , but Y am of Crist .
46001013	Whether Crist is departid ? whether Poul was crucified for you , ether ye ben baptisid in the name of Poul ?
46001014	Y do thankyngis to my God , that Y baptiside noon of you , but Crispus and Gayus ;
46001015	lest ony man seie , that ye ben baptisid in my name .
46001016	And Y baptiside also the hous of Stephan , but Y woot not , that Y baptiside ony other .
46001017	For Crist sente me not to baptise , but to preche the gospel ; not in wisdom of word , that the cros of Crist be not voidid awei .
46001018	For the word of the cros is foli to hem that perischen ; but to hem that ben maad saaf , that is to seie , to vs , it is the vertu of God .
46001019	For it is writun , Y schal distruye the wisdom of wise men , and Y schal reproue the prudence of prudent men .
46001020	Where is the wise man ? where is the wise lawiere ? where is the purchasour of this world ? Whether God hath not maad the wisdom of this world fonned ?
46001021	For the world in wisdom of God knewe not God bi wisdom , it pleside to God , bi foli of prechyng , ` to maken hem saaf that bileueden .
46001022	For Jewis seken signes , and Grekis seken wisdom ;
46001023	but we prechen Crist crucified , to Jewis sclaundre , and to hethene men foli ;
46001024	but to tho Jewis and Grekis that ben clepid , we prechen Crist the vertu of God and the wisdom of God .
46001025	For that that is foli thing of God , is wiser than men ; and that that is the feble thing of God , is strengere than men .
46001026	But , britheren , se ye youre clepyng ; for not many wise men aftir the fleisch , not many myyti , not many noble .
46001027	But God chees tho thingis that ben fonned of the world , to confounde wise men ;
46001028	and God chees the feble thingis of the world , to confounde the stronge thingis ; and God chees the vnnoble thingis ` and dispisable thingis of the world , and tho thingis that ben not , to distruye tho thingis that ben ;
46001029	that ech man haue not glorie in his siyt .
46001030	But of hym ye ben in Crist Jhesu , which is maad of God to vs wisdom , and riytwisnesse , and holynesse , and ayenbiyng ; that ,
46001031	as it is wrytun , He that glorieth , haue glorie in the Lord .
46002001	And Y , britheren , whanne Y cam to you , cam not in the heiynesse of word , ethir of wisdom , tellynge to you the witnessyng of Crist .
46002002	For Y demede not me to kunne ony thing among you , but Crist Jhesu , and hym crucified .
46002003	And Y in sikenesse , and drede , and myche trembling , was among you ;
46002004	and my word and my preching was not in suteli sturyng wordis of mannus wisdom , but in schewyng of spirit and of vertu ;
46002005	that youre feith be not in the wisdom of men , but in the vertu of God .
46002006	For we speken wisdom among perfit men , but not wisdom of this world , nether of princes of this world , that ben distried ;
46002007	but we speken the wisdom of God in mysterie , ` which wisdom is hid ; which wisdom God bifor ordeynede bifor worldis in to oure glorie ,
46002008	which noon of the princes of this world knew ; for if thei hadden knowe , thei schulden neuere haue crucified the Lord of glorie .
46002009	But as it is writun , That iye say not , ne eere herde , nether it stiede in to herte of man , what thingis God arayede to hem that louen hym ;
46002010	but God schewide to vs bi his spirit . For whi the spirit serchith alle thingis , yhe , the depe thingis of God .
46002011	And who of men woot , what thingis ben of man , but the spirit of man that is in hym ? So what thingis ben of God , no man knowith , but the spirit of God .
46002012	And we han not resseiued the spirit of this world , but the spirit that is of God , that we wite what thingis ben youun to vs of God .
46002013	Whiche thingis we speken also , not in wise wordis of mannus wisdom , but in the doctryn of the spirit , and maken a liknesse of spiritual thingis to goostli men .
46002014	For a beestli man perseyueth not tho thingis that ben of the spirit of God ; for it is foli to hym , and he may not vndurstonde , for it is examyned goostli .
46002015	But a spiritual man demeth alle thingis , and he is demed of no man .
46002016	As it is writun , And who knew the wit of the Lord , or who tauyte hym ? And we han the wit of Crist .
46003001	And Y , britheren , myyte not speke to you as to spiritual men , but as to fleischli men ;
46003002	as to litle children in Crist , Y yaf to you mylk drynke , not mete ; for ye myyten not yit , nether ye moun now , for yit ye ben fleischli .
46003003	For while strijf is among you , whether ye ben not fleischli , and ye gon aftir man ?
46003004	For whanne summe seith , Y am of Poul , another , But Y am of Apollo , whethir ye ben not men ? What therfor is Apollo , and what Poul ?
46003005	Thei ben mynystris of hym , to whom ye han bileuyd ; and to ech man as God hath youun .
46003006	Y plauntide , Apollo moystide , but God yaf encreessyng .
46003007	Therfor nether he that plauntith is ony thing , nethir he that moistith , but God that yiueth encreessyng .
46003008	And he that plauntith , and he that moistith , ben oon ; and ech schal take his owne mede , aftir his trauel .
46003009	For we ben the helperis of God ; ye ben the erthetiliyng of God , ye ben the bildyng of God .
46003010	Aftir the grace ` of God that is youun to me , as a wise maistir carpenter Y settide the foundement ; and another bildith aboue . But ech man se , hou he bildith aboue .
46003011	For no man may sette another foundement , outtakun that that is sett , which is Crist Jhesus .
46003012	For if ony bildith ouer this foundement , gold , siluer , preciouse stoonys , stickis , hey , or stobil , euery mannus werk schal be open ;
46003013	for the dai of the Lord schal declare , for it schal be schewid in fier ; the fier schal preue the werk of ech man , what maner werk it is .
46003014	If the werk of ony man dwelle stille , which he bildide aboue , he schal resseyue mede .
46003015	If ony mannus werk brenne , he schal suffre harm ; but he schal be saaf , so netheles as bi fier .
46003016	Witen ye not , that ye ben the temple of God , and the spirit of God dwellith in you ?
46003017	And if ony defoulith the temple of God , God schal leese hym ; for the temple of God is hooli , which ye ben .
46003018	No man disseyue hym silf . If ony man among you is seyn to be wiys in this world , be he maad a fool , that he be wijs .
46003019	For the wisdom of this world is foli anentis God ; for it is writun , Y schal catche wise men in her fel wisdom ;
46003020	and eft , The Lord knowith the thouytis of wise men , for tho ben veyn .
46003021	Therfor no man haue glorie in men .
46003022	For alle thingis ben youre , ethir Poul , ether Apollo , ether Cefas , ether the world , ether lijf , ether deth , ether thingis present , ethir thingis to comynge ; for alle thingis ben youre ,
46003023	and ye ben of Crist , and Crist is of God .
46004001	So a man gesse vs , as mynystris of Crist , and dispenderis of the mynysteries of God .
46004002	Now it is souyt here among the dispenderis , that a man be foundun trewe .
46004003	And to me it is for the leest thing , that Y be demyd of you , or of mannus dai ; but nether Y deme my silf .
46004004	For Y am no thing ouer trowynge to my silf , but not in this thing Y am iustified ; for he that demeth me , is the Lord .
46004005	Therfor nyle ye deme bifore the tyme , til that the Lord come , which schal liytne the hyd thingis of derknessis , and schal schewe the counseils of hertis ; and thanne preisyng schal be to ech man of God .
46004006	And , britheren , Y haue transfigurid these thingis in to me and in to Apollo , for you ; that in vs ye lerne , lest ouer that it is writun , oon ayens another be blowun with pride for another .
46004007	Who demeth thee ? And what hast thou , that thou hast not resseyued ? And if thou hast resseyued , what gloriest thou , as thou haddist not resseyued ?
46004008	Nowe ye ben fyllid , now ye ben maad riche ; ye regnen with outen vs ; and Y wolde that ye regnen , that also we regnen with you .
46004009	And Y gesse , that God schewide vs the laste apostlis , as thilke that ben sent to the deth ; for we ben maad a spectacle to the world , and to aungels , and to men .
46004010	We foolis for Crist , but ye prudent in Crist ; we sike , but ye stronge ; ye noble , but we vnnoble .
46004011	Til in to this our we hungren , and thirsten , and ben nakid , and ben smytun with buffatis ,
46004012	and we ben vnstable , and we trauelen worchynge with oure hondis ; we ben cursid , and we blessen ; we suffren persecucioun , and we abiden longe ; we ben blasfemyd , and we bisechen ;
46004013	as clensyngis of this world we ben maad the ` out castyng of alle thingis ` til yit .
46004014	Y write not these thingis , that Y confounde you , but Y warne as my moste dereworthe sones .
46004015	For whi if ye han ten thousynde of vndur maistris in Crist , but not many fadris ; for in Crist Jhesu Y haue gendrid you bi the gospel .
46004016	Therfor , britheren , Y preye you , be ye foleweris of me , as Y of Crist .
46004017	Therfor Y sente to you Tymothe , which is my most dereworthe sone , and feithful in the Lord , which schal teche you my weies , that ben in Crist Jhesu ; as Y teche euery where in ech chirche .
46004018	As thouy Y schulde not come to you , so summe ben blowun with pride ;
46004019	but Y schal come to you soone , if God wole ; and Y schal knowe not the word of hem that ben blowun with pride , but the vertu .
46004020	For the rewme of God is not in word , but in vertu .
46004021	What wole ye ? Schal Y come to you in a yerde , or in charite , and in spirit of myldenesse ?
46005001	In al maner fornycacioun is herd among you , and siche fornycacioun , which is not among hethene men , so that summan haue the wijf of his fadir .
46005002	And ye ben bolnyd with pride , and not more hadden weilyng , that he that dide this werk , be takun awei fro the myddil of you .
46005003	And Y absent in bodi , but present in spirit , now haue demyd as present hym that hath thus wrouyt , whanne
46005004	ye ben gaderid togidere in the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , and my spirit , with the vertu of the Lord Jhesu ,
46005005	to take siche a man to Sathanas , in to the perischyng of fleisch , that the spirit be saaf in the dai of oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
46005006	Youre gloriyng is not good . Witen ye not , that a litil sourdow apeyrith al the gobet ?
46005007	Clense ye out the old sourdow , that ye be new sprengyng togidere , as ye ben therf . For Crist offrid is oure pask .
46005008	Therfor ete we , not in eld sourdowy , nether in sourdowy of malice and weywardnesse , but in therf thingis of clernesse and of treuthe .
46005009	I wroot to you in a pistle , that ye be not medlid with letchours ,
46005010	not with letchours of this world , ne coueitous men , ne raueynours , ne with men seruynge to mawmetis , ellis ye schulden haue go out of this world .
46005011	But now Y wroot to you , that ye be not meynd . But if he that is named a brother among you , and is a letchour , or coueitouse , or seruynge to ydols , or cursere , or ful of drunkenesse , or raueynour , to take no mete with siche .
46005012	For what is it to me to deme of hem that ben with oute forth ? Whether ye demen not of thingis that ben with ynne forth ?
46005013	For God schal deme hem that ben withouten forth . Do ye awei yuel fro you silf .
46006001	Dar any of you that hath a cause ayens another , be demed at wickid men , and not at hooli men ?
46006002	Whether ye witen not , that seyntis schulen deme of this world ? And if the world schal be demed bi you , be ye vnworthi to deme of the leste thingis ?
46006003	Witen ye not , that we schulen deme aungels ? hou myche more worldli thingis ?
46006004	Therfor if ye han worldli domes , ordeyne ye tho contemptible men , that ben in the chirche , to deme .
46006005	Y seie to make you aschamed . So ther is not ony wise man , that may deme bitwixe a brothir and his brothir ;
46006006	but a brothir with brothir stryueth in dom , and that among vnfeithful men .
46006007	And now trespas is algatis in you , for ye han domes among you . Whi rather take ye no wrong ? whi rather suffre ye not disseit ?
46006008	But and ye doen wrong , and doen fraude , and that to britheren .
46006009	Whether ye witen not , that wickid men schulen not welde the kyngdom of God ? Nyle ye erre ; nethir letchours , nether men that seruen mawmetis , nether auouteris ,
46006010	nether letchouris ayen kynde , nether thei that doon letcheri with men , nether theues , nether auerouse men , nethir ` ful of drunkenesse , nether curseris , nether rauenours , schulen welde the kyngdom of God .
46006011	And ye weren sum tyme these thingis ; but ye ben waischun , but ye ben halewid , but ye ben iustefied in the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , and in the spirit of oure God .
46006012	Alle thingis ben leeueful to me , but not alle thingis ben spedeful . Alle thingis ben leeueful to me , but Y schal not be brouyt doun vndur ony mannus power .
46006013	Mete to the wombe , and the wombe to metis ; and God schal distruye bothe this and that . And the bodi not to fornycacioun , but to the Lord , and the Lord to the bodi .
46006014	For God reiside the Lord , and schal reise vs bi his vertu .
46006015	Witen ye not , that youre bodies ben membris of Crist ? Schal Y thanne take the membris of Crist , and schal Y make the membris of an hoore ? God forbede .
46006016	Whether ye witen not , that he that cleueth to an hoore , is maad o bodi ? For he seith , Ther schulen be tweyne in o fleisch .
46006017	And he that cleueth to the Lord , is o spirit .
46006018	Fle ye fornycacioun ; al synne what euere synne a man doith , is with out the bodi ; but he that doith fornycacioun , synneth ayens his bodi .
46006019	Whether ye witen not , that youre membris ben the temple of the Hooli Goost , that is in you , whom ye han of God , and ye ben not youre owne ?
46006020	For ye ben bouyt with greet prijs . Glorifie ye , and bere ye God in youre bodi .
46007001	But of thilke thingis that ye han write to me , it is good to a man to touche not a womman .
46007002	But for fornycacioun eche man haue his owne wijf , and ech womman haue hir owne hosebonde .
46007003	The hosebonde yelde dette to the wijf , and also the wijf to the hosebonde .
46007004	The womman hath not power of hir bodi , but the hosebonde ; and the hosebonde hath not power of his bodi , but the womman .
46007005	Nyle ye defraude eche to othere , but perauenture of consent to a tyme , that ye yyue tent to preier ; and eft turne ye ayen to the same thing , lest Sathanas tempte you for youre vncontynence .
46007006	But Y seie this thing as yyuyng leeue , not bi comaundement .
46007007	For Y wole , that alle men be as my silf . But eche man hath his propre yifte of God ; oon thus , and another thus .
46007008	But Y seie to hem , that ben not weddid , and to widewis , it is good to hem , if thei dwellen so as Y .
46007009	That if thei conteynen not hem silf , be thei weddid ; for it is betere to be weddid , than to be brent .
46007010	But to hem that ben ioyned in matrymonye , Y comaunde , not Y , but the Lord , that the wijf departe not fro the hosebonde ;
46007011	and that if sche departith , that sche dwelle vnweddid , or be recounselid to hir hosebonde ; and the hosebonde forsake not the wijf .
46007012	But to othere Y seie , not the Lord . If ony brother hath an vnfeithful wijf , and sche consenteth to dwelle with hym , leeue he hir not .
46007013	And if ony womman hath an vnfeithful hosebonde , and this consentith to dwelle with hir , leeue sche not the hosebonde .
46007014	For the vnfeithful hosebonde is halewid bi the feithful womman , and the vnfeithful womman is halewid bi the feithful hosebonde . Ellis youre children weren vncleene , but now thei ben hooli .
46007015	That if the vnfeithful departith , departe he . For whi the brother or sistir is not suget to seruage in siche ; for God hath clepid vs in pees .
46007016	And wherof wost thou , womman , if thou schalt make the man saaf ; or wherof wost thou , man , if thou schalt make the womman saaf ?
46007017	But as the Lord hath departid to ech , and as God hath clepid ech man , so go he , as Y teche in alle chirchis .
46007018	A man circumcidid is clepid , brynge he not to the prepucie . A man is clepid in prepucie , be he not circumcidid .
46007019	Circumcisioun is nouyt , and prepucie is nouyt , but the kepyng of the maundementis of God .
46007020	Ech man in what clepyng he is clepid , in that dwelle he .
46007021	Thou seruaunt art clepid , be it no charge to thee ; but if thou maist be fre , ` the rather vse thou .
46007022	He that is a seruaunt , and is clepid in the Lord , is a freman of the Lord . Also he that is a freman , and is clepid , is the seruaunt of Crist .
46007023	With prijs ye ben bouyt ; nyle ye be maad seruauntis of men .
46007024	Therfor ech man in what thing he is clepid a brothir , dwelle he in this anentis God .
46007025	But of virgyns Y haue no comaundement of God ; but Y yyue counseil , as he that hath mercy of the Lord , that Y be trewe .
46007026	Therfor Y gesse , that this thing is good for the present nede ; for it is good to a man to be so .
46007027	Thou art boundun to a wijf , nyle thou seke vnbyndyng ; thou art vnboundun fro a wijf , nyle thou seke a wijf .
46007028	But if thou hast takun a wijf , thou hast not synned ; and if a maidun is weddid , sche synnede not ; nethelesse siche schulen haue tribulacioun of fleisch .
46007029	But Y spare you . Therfor , britheren , Y seie this thing , The tyme is schort . Another is this , that thei that han wyues , be as thouy thei hadden noon ;
46007030	and thei that wepen , as thei wepten not ; and thei that ioien , as thei ioieden not ; and thei that bien , as thei hadden not ;
46007031	and thei that vsen this world , as thei that vsen not . For whi the figure of this world passith .
46007032	But Y wole , that ye be without bisynesse , for he that is without wijf , is bisi what thingis ben of the Lord , hou he schal plese God .
46007033	But he that is with a wijf , is bysy what thingis ben of the world , hou he schal plese the wijf , and he is departid .
46007034	And a womman vnweddid and maidun thenkith what thingis ben of the Lord , that sche be hooli in bodi and spirit . But sche that is weddid , thenkith what thingis ben of the world , hou sche schal plese the hosebonde .
46007035	And Y seie these thingis to youre profit , not that Y caste to you a snare , but to that that is onest , and that yyueth esynesse , with outen lettyng to make preieris to the Lord .
46007036	And if ony man gessith hym silf to be seyn foule on his virgyn , that sche is ful woxun , and so it bihoueth to be doon , do sche that that sche wole ; sche synneth not , if sche be weddid .
46007037	For he that ordeynede stabli in his herte , not hauynge nede , but hauynge power of his wille , and hath demed in his herte this thing , to kepe his virgyn , doith wel .
46007038	Therfore he that ioyneth his virgyn in matrymonye , doith wel ; and he that ioyneth not , doith betere .
46007039	The womman is boundun to the lawe , as longe tyme as hir hosebonde lyueth ; and if hir hosebonde is deed , sche is delyuered fro the lawe of the hosebonde , be sche weddid to whom sche wole , oneli in the Lord .
46007040	But sche schal be more blessid , if sche dwellith thus , aftir my counsel ; and Y wene , that Y haue the Spirit of God .
46008001	But of these thingis that ben sacrified to ydols , we witen , for alle we han kunnyng . But kunnyng blowith , charite edefieth .
46008002	But if ony man gessith , that he kan ony thing , he hath not yit knowe hou it bihoueth hym to kunne .
46008003	And if ony man loueth God , this is knowun of hym .
46008004	But of metis that ben offrid to idols , we witen , that an idol is no thing in the world , and that ther is no God but oon .
46008005	For thouy ther ben summe that ben seid goddis , ethir in heuene , ether in erthe , as ther ben many goddis , and many lordis ;
46008006	netheles to vs is o God , the fadir , of whom ben alle thingis , and we in hym ; and o Lord Jhesu Crist , bi whom ben alle thingis , and we bi hym .
46008007	But not in alle men is kunnyng . For summen with conscience of ydol til now eten as thing offrid to idolis ; and her conscience is defoulid , for it is sijk .
46008008	Mete comendith vs not to God ; for nether we schulen faile , if we eten not , nether if we eten , we schulen haue plente .
46008009	But se ye , lest perauenture this your leeue be maad hurtyng to sijke men .
46008010	For if ony man schal se hym , that hath kunnyng , etynge in a place where idols ben worschipid , whethir his conscience , sithen it is sijke , schal not be edified to ete thingis offrid to idols ?
46008011	And the sijk brothir , for whom Crist diede , schal perische in thi kunnyng .
46008012	For thus ye synnyng ayens britheren , and smytynge her sijk conscience synnen ayens Crist .
46008013	Wherfor if mete sclaundrith my brother , Y schal neuere ete fleisch , lest Y sclaundre my brothir .
46009001	Whether Y am not fre ? Am Y not apostle ? Whether Y saiy not ` Crist Jhesu , ` oure Lord ? Whether ye ben not my werk in the Lord ?
46009002	And thouy to othere Y am not apostle , but netheles to you Y am ; for ye ben the litle signe of myn apostlehed in the Lord .
46009003	My defense to hem that axen me , that is .
46009004	Whether we han not power to ete and drynke ?
46009005	Whether we han not power to lede aboute a womman a sistir , as also othere apostlis , and britheren of the Lord , and Cefas ?
46009006	Or Y aloone and Barnabas han not power to worche these thingis ?
46009007	Who traueilith ony tyme with hise owne wagis ? Who plauntith a vynyerd , and etith not of his fruyt ? Who kepith a flok , and etith not of the mylk of the flok ?
46009008	Whether aftir man Y sey these thingis ? whether also the lawe seith not these thingis ?
46009009	For it is writun in the lawe of Moises , Thou schalt not bynde the mouth of the ox threischynge . Whethir of oxun is charge to God ?
46009010	Whether for vs he seith these thingis ? For whi tho ben writun for vs ; for he that erith , owith to ere in hope , and he that threischith , in hope to take fruytis .
46009011	If we sowen spiritual thingis to you , is it grete , if we repen youre fleischli thingis ?
46009012	If othere ben parteneris of youre power , whi not rathere we ? But we vsen not this power , but we suffren alle thingis , that we yyuen no lettyng to the euangelie of Crist .
46009013	Witen ye not , that thei that worchen in the temple , eten tho thingis that ben of the temple , and thei that seruen to the auter , ben partyneris of the auter ?
46009014	So the Lord ordeynede to hem that tellen the gospel , to lyue of the gospel .
46009015	But Y vside noon of these thingis ; sotheli Y wroot not these thingis , that tho be don so in me ; for it is good ` to me rather to die , than that ony man ` auoyde my glorie .
46009016	For if Y preche the gospel , glorie is not to me , for nedelich Y mot don it ; for wo to me , if Y preche not the gospel .
46009017	But if Y do this thing wilfuli , Y haue mede ; but if ayens my wille , dispending is bitakun to me .
46009018	What thanne is my mede ? That Y prechynge the gospel , putte the gospel with outen otheris cost , that Y vse not my power in the gospel .
46009019	Forwhi whanne Y was fre of alle men , Y made me seruaunt of alle men , to wynne the mo men .
46009020	And to Jewis Y am maad as a Jew , to wynne the Jewis ; to hem that ben vndur the lawe ,
46009021	as Y were vndur the lawe , whanne Y was not vndur the lawe , to wynne hem that weren vndur the lawe ; to hem that weren with out lawe , as Y were with out lawe , whanne Y was not with out the lawe of God , but Y was in the lawe of Crist , to wynne hem that weren with out lawe .
46009022	Y am maad sijk to sike men , to wynne sike men ; to alle men Y am maad alle thingis , to make alle men saaf .
46009023	But Y do alle thingis for the gospel , that Y be maad partener of it .
46009024	Witen ye not , that thei that rennen in a furlong , alle rennen , but oon takith the prijs ? So renne ye , that ye catche .
46009025	Ech man that stryueth in fiyt , absteyneth hym fro alle thingis ; and thei , that thei take a corruptible coroun , but we an vncorrupt .
46009026	Therfor Y renne so , not as ` in to vncerteyn thing ; thus Y fiyte , not as betynge the eir ;
46009027	but Y chastise my bodi , and bryng it in to seruage ; lest perauenture whanne Y preche to othere , Y my silf be maad repreuable .
46010001	Britheren , Y nyle , that ye vnknowe , that alle oure fadris weren vndur cloude , and alle passiden the see ;
46010002	and alle weren baptisid in Moises , in the cloude and in the see ;
46010003	and alle eeten the same spiritual mete ,
46010004	and alle drunken the same spiritual drynke ; thei drunken of the spiritual stoon folewynge hem ; and the stoon was Crist .
46010005	But not in ful manye of hem it was wel pleasaunt to God ; for whi thei weren cast doun in desert .
46010006	But these thingis ben don in figure of vs , that we be not coueyteris of yuele thingis , as thei coueitiden .
46010007	Nether be ye maad idolatreris , as summe of hem ; as it is writun , The puple sat to ete and drynke , and thei risen vp to pleie .
46010008	Nether do we fornycacioun , as summe of hem diden fornicacioun , and thre and twenti thousyndis weren deed in o dai .
46010009	Nethir tempte we Crist , as summe of hem temptiden , and perischiden of serpentis .
46010010	Nether grutche ye , as summe of hem grutchiden , and thei perischiden of a distrier .
46010011	And alle these thingis felliden to hem in figure ; but thei ben writun to oure amendyng , in to whiche the endis of the worldis ben comun .
46010012	Therfor he that gessith hym , ` that he stondith , se he , that he falle not .
46010013	Temptacioun take ` not you , but mannus temptacioun ; for God is trewe , which schal not suffre you to be temptid aboue that that ye moun ; but he schal make with temptacioun also purueyaunce , that ye moun suffre .
46010014	Wherfor , ye most dereworthe to me , fle ye fro worschiping of maumetis .
46010015	As to prudent men Y speke , deme ye you silf that thing that Y seie .
46010016	Whether the cuppe of blessyng which we blessen , is not the comynyng of Cristis blood ? and whether the breed which we breken , is not the takyng of the bodi of the Lord ?
46010017	For we manye ben o breed and o bodi , alle we that taken part of o breed and of o cuppe .
46010018	Se ye Israel aftir the fleisch , whethir thei that eeten sacrifices , ben not partyneris of the auter ?
46010019	What therfor seie Y , that a thing that is offrid to idols is ony thing , or that the idol is ony thing ?
46010020	But tho thingis that hethene men offren , thei offren to deuelis , and not to God . But Y nyle , that ye ben maad felowis of feendis ; for ye moun not drynke the cuppe of the Lord , and the cuppe of fendis ;
46010021	ye moun not be parteneris of the boord of the Lord , and of the bord of feendis .
46010022	Whether we han enuye to the Lord ? whether we ben strengere then he ? Alle thingis ben leeueful to me , but not alle thingis ben spedeful .
46010023	Alle thingis ben leeueful to me , but not alle thingis edifien .
46010024	No man seke that thing that is his owne , but that thing that is of an othere .
46010025	Al thing that is seld in the bocherie , ete ye , axynge no thing for conscience .
46010026	The erthe and the plente of it is , the Lordis .
46010027	If ony of hethene men clepith you to soper , and ye wole go , al thing that is set to you , ete ye , axynge no thing for conscience .
46010028	But if ony man seith , This thing is offrid to idols , nyle ye ete , for hym that schewide , and for conscience ; and Y seie not ,
46010029	thi conscience , but of an othere . But wherto is my fredom demed of an othere mannus conscience ?
46010030	Therfor if Y take part with grace , what am Y blasfemed , for that that Y do thankyngis ?
46010031	Therfor whether ye eten , or drynken , or don ony other thing , do ye alle thingis ` in to the glorie of God .
46010032	Be ye with outen sclaundre to Jewis , and to hethene men , and to the chirche of God ;
46010033	as Y bi alle thingis plese to alle men , not sekynge that that is profitable to me , but that that is profitable to manye men , that thei be maad saaf .
46011001	Be ye my foleweris , as Y am of Crist .
46011002	And , britheren , Y preise you , that bi alle thingis ye ben myndeful of me ; and as Y bitook to you my comaundementis , ye holden .
46011003	But Y wole that ye wite , that Crist is heed of ech man ; but the heed of the womman is the man ; and the heed of Crist is God .
46011004	Ech man preiynge , or profeciynge , whanne his heed is hilid , defoulith his heed .
46011005	But ech womman preiynge , or profeciynge , whanne hir heed is not hilid , defoulith hir heed ; for it is oon , as if sche were pollid .
46011006	And if a womman be not keuered , be sche pollid ; and if it is foul thing to a womman to be pollid , or to be maad ballid , hile sche hir heed .
46011007	But a man schal not hile his heed , for he is the ymage and the glorie of God ; but a womman is the glorie of man .
46011008	For a man is not of the womman , but the womman of the man .
46011009	And the man is not maad for the womman , but the womman for the man .
46011010	Therfor the womman schal haue an hilyng on hir heed , also for aungelis .
46011011	Netheles nether the man is with outen womman , nether the womman is with oute man , in the Lord .
46011012	Forwhi as the womman is of man , so the man is bi the womman ; but alle thingis ben of God .
46011013	Deme ye you silf ; bisemeth it a womman not hilid on the heed to preye God ?
46011014	Nether the kynde it silf techith vs , for if a man nursche longe heer , it is schenschipe to hym ;
46011015	but if a womman nurische longe heer , it is glorie to hir , for heeris ben youun to hir for keueryng .
46011016	But if ony man is seyn to be ful of strijf , we han noon siche custom , nethir the chirche of God .
46011017	But this thing Y comaunde , not preisynge , that ye comen togidere not in to the betere , but in to the worse .
46011018	First for whanne ye comen togidere in to the chirche , Y here that discenciouns ben , and in parti Y bileue .
46011019	For it bihoueth eresies to be , that thei that ben prouyd , ben opynli knowun in you .
46011020	Therfor whanne ye comen togidere in to oon , now it is not to ete the Lordis soper ;
46011021	for whi ech man bifor takith his soper to ete , and oon is hungry , and another is drunkun .
46011022	Whether ye han not housis to ete and drynke , or ye dispisen the chirche of God , and confounden hem that han noon ? What schal Y seie to you ? Y preise you , but here yn Y preise you not .
46011023	For Y haue takun of the Lord that thing , which Y haue bitakun to you . For the Lord Jhesu , in what niyt he was bitraied ,
46011024	took breed , and dide thankyngis , and brak , and seide , Take ye , and ete ye ; this is my bodi , which schal be bitraied for you ; do ye this thing in to my mynde .
46011025	Also the cuppe , aftir that he hadde soupid , and seide , This cuppe is the newe testament in my blood ; do ye this thing , as ofte as ye schulen drynke , in to my mynde .
46011026	For as ofte as ye schulen ete this breed , and schulen drynke the cuppe , ye schulen telle the deth of the Lord , til that he come .
46011027	Therfor who euere etith the breed , or drynkith the cuppe of the Lord vnworthili , he schal be gilti of the bodi and of the blood of the Lord .
46011028	But preue a man hym silf , and so ete he of ` the ilke breed , and drynke of the cuppe .
46011029	For he that etith and drinkith vnworthili , etith and drinkith doom to hym , not wiseli demyng the bodi of the Lord .
46011030	Therfor among you many ben sijke and feble , and manye slepen .
46011031	And if we demyden wiseli vs silf , we schulden not be demyd ;
46011032	but while we ben demyd of the Lord , we ben chastisid , that we be not dampnyd with this world .
46011033	Therfor , my britheren , whanne ye comen togidere to ete , abide ye togidere .
46011034	If ony man hungrith , ete he at home , that ye come not togidere in to doom . And Y schal dispose othere thingis , whanne Y come .
46012001	But of spiritual thingis , britheren , Y nyle that ye vnknowun .
46012002	For ye witen , that whanne ye weren hethene men , hou ye weren led goynge to doumbe maumetis .
46012003	Therfor Y make knowun to you , that no man spekynge in the spirit of God , seith departyng fro Jhesu ; and no man may seie the Lord Jhesu , but in the Hooli Goost .
46012004	And dyuerse graces ther ben , but it is al oon Spirit ;
46012005	and dyuerse seruyces ther ben , but it is al oon Lord ; and dyuerse worchingis ther ben ,
46012006	but ` al is oon God , that worchith alle thingis in alle thingis .
46012007	And to ech man the schewyng of spirit is youun to profit . The word of wisdom is youun to oon bi spirit ;
46012008	to another the word of kunnyng , bi the same spirit ;
46012009	feith to another , in the same spirit ; to anothere , grace of helthis , in o spirit ;
46012010	to another , the worchyng of vertues ; to another , profecie ; to another , very knowyng of spiritis ; to another , kyndis of langagis ; to another , expownyng of wordis .
46012011	And oon and the same spirit worchith alle these thingis , departynge to ech bi hem silf as he wole .
46012012	For as ther is o body , and hath many membris , and alle the membris of the bodi whanne tho ben manye , ben o bodi , so also Crist .
46012013	For in o spirit alle we ben baptisid ` in to o bodi , ether Jewis , ether hethene , ether seruauntis , ether free ; and alle we ben fillid with drink in o spirit .
46012014	For the bodi is not o membre , but manye .
46012015	If the foot seith , For Y am not the hoond , Y am not of the bodi ; not therfor it is not of the bodi .
46012016	And if the ere seith , For Y am not the iye , Y am not of the bodi ; not therfor it is not of the bodi .
46012017	If al the bodi is the iye , where is heryng ? and if al the bodi is heryng , where is smellyng ?
46012018	But now God hath set membris , and ech of hem in the bodi , as he wolde .
46012019	That if alle weren o membre , where were the bodi ?
46012020	But now ther ben many membris , but o bodi .
46012021	And the iye may not seie to the hond , Y haue no nede to thi werkis ; or eft the heed to the feet , Ye ben not necessarie to me .
46012022	But myche more tho that ben seyn to be the lowere membris of the bodi , ben more nedeful ;
46012023	and thilke that we gessen to be the vnworthier membris of the bodi , we yyuen more honour ` to hem ; and tho membris that ben vnonest , han more oneste .
46012024	For oure oneste membris han nede of noon ; but God tempride the bodi , yyuynge more worschip to it , to whom it failide ,
46012025	that debate be not in the bodi , but that the membris be bisi in to the same thing ech for othere .
46012026	And if o membre suffrith ony thing , alle membris suffren therwith ; ethir if o membre ioieth , alle membris ioien togidere .
46012027	And ye ben the bodi of Crist , and membris of membre .
46012028	But God sette sum men in the chirche , fyrst apostlis , the secunde tyme prophetis , the thridde techeris , aftirward vertues , aftirward graces of heelyngis , helpyngis , gouernails , kyndis of langagis , interpretaciouns of wordis .
46012029	Whether alle apostlis ? whethir alle prophetis ? whether alle techeris ? whether alle vertues ?
46012030	whether alle men han grace of heelyngis ? whether alle speken with langagis ? whether alle expownen ?
46012031	But sue ye the betere goostli yiftis . And yit Y schewe to you a more exellent weye .
46013001	If Y speke with tungis of men and of aungels , and Y haue not charite , Y am maad as bras sownynge , or a cymbal tynkynge .
46013002	And if Y haue prophecie , and knowe alle mysteries , and al kunnynge , and if Y haue al feith , so that Y meue hillis fro her place , and Y haue not charite , Y am nouyt .
46013003	And if Y departe alle my goodis in to the metis of pore men , and yf Y bitake my bodi , so that Y brenne , and if Y haue not charite , it profitith to me no thing .
46013004	Charite is pacient , it is benygne ; charite enuyeth not , it doith not wickidli , it is not blowun ,
46013005	it is not coueytouse , it sekith not tho thingis that ben hise owne , it is not stirid to wraththe , it thenkith not yuel ,
46013006	it ioyeth not on wickidnesse , but it ioieth togidere to treuthe ;
46013007	it suffrith alle thingis , it bileueth alle thingis , it hopith alle thingis , it susteyneth alle thingis .
46013008	Charite fallith neuere doun , whether prophecies schulen be voidid , ethir langagis schulen ceesse , ethir science schal be distried .
46013009	For a parti we knowun , and a parti we prophecien ;
46013010	but whanne that schal come that is parfit , that thing that is of parti schal be auoidid .
46013011	Whanne Y was a litil child , Y spak as a litil child , Y vndurstood as a litil child , Y thouyte as a litil child ; but whanne Y was maad a man , Y auoidide tho thingis that weren of a litil child .
46013012	And we seen now bi a myrour in derknesse , but thanne face to face ; now Y knowe of parti , but thanne Y schal knowe , as Y am knowun .
46013013	And now dwellen feith , hope , and charite , these thre ; but the most of these is charite .
46014001	Sue ye charite , loue ye spiritual thingis , but more that ye prophecien .
46014002	And he that spekith in tunge , spekith not to men , but to God ; for no man herith . But the spirit spekith mysteries .
46014003	For he that prophecieth , spekith to men to edificacioun , and monestyng , and coumfortyng .
46014004	He that spekith in tunge , edifieth hym silf ; but he that prophecieth , edifieth the chirche of God .
46014005	And Y wole , that alle ye speke in tungis , but more that ye prophecie . For he that prophecieth , is more than he that spekith in langagis ; but perauenture he expoune , that the chirche take edificacioun .
46014006	But now , britheren , if Y come to you , and speke in langagis , what schal Y profite to you , but if Y speke to you ethir in reuelacioun , ethir in science , ethir in prophecie , ether in techyng ?
46014007	For tho thingis that ben withouten soule , and yyueth voices , ethir pipe , ether harpe , but tho yyuen distinccioun of sownyngis , hou schal it be knowun that is sungun , ether that that is trumpid ?
46014008	For if a trumpe yyue an vncerteyn soune , who schal make hym silf redi to batel ?
46014009	So but ye yyuen an opyn word bi tunge , hou schal that that is seid be knowun ? For ye schulen be spekynge in veyn .
46014010	There ben many kyndis of langagis in this world , and no thing is with outen vois .
46014011	But if Y knowe not the vertu of a vois , Y schal be to hym , to whom Y schal speke , a barbarik ; and he that spekith to me , schal be a barbarik .
46014012	So ye , for ye ben loueris of spiritis , seke ye that ye be plenteuouse to edificacioun of the chirche .
46014013	And therfor he that spekith in langage , preie , that he expowne .
46014014	For if Y preye in tunge , my spirit preieth ; myn vndurstondyng is with outen fruyt .
46014015	What thanne ? Y schal preye in spirit , Y schal preye in mynde ; Y schal seie salm , in spirit , Y schal seie salm also in mynde .
46014016	For if thou blessist in spirit , who fillith the place of an ydiot , hou schal he seie Amen on thi blessyng , for he woot not , what thou seist ?
46014017	For thou doist wel thankyngis , but an othir man is not edefied .
46014018	Y thanke my God , for Y speke in the langage of alle you ;
46014019	but in the chirche Y wole speke fyue wordis in my wit , that also Y teche othere men , than ten thousynde of wordis in tunge .
46014020	Britheren , nyle ye be maad children in wittis , but in malice be ye children ; but in wittis be ye parfit .
46014021	For in the lawe it is writun , That in othere tungis and othere lippis Y schal speke to this puple , and nether so thei schulen here me , seith the Lord .
46014022	Therfor langagis ben in to tokene , not to feithful men , but to men out of the feith ; but prophecies ben not to men out of the feith , but to feithful men .
46014023	Therfor if alle the chirche come togidere in to oon , and alle men speken in tungis , if idiotis , ether men out of the feith , entren , whether thei schulen not seie , What ben ye woode ?
46014024	But if alle men prophecien , if ony vnfeithful man or idiot entre , he is conuyct of alle , he is wiseli demyd of alle .
46014025	For the hid thingis of his herte ben knowun , and so he schal falle doun on the face , and schal worschipe God , and schewe verili that God is in you .
46014026	What thanne , britheren ? Whanne ye comen togidere , ech of you hath a salm , he hath techyng , he hath apocalips , he hath tunge , he hath expownyng ; alle thingis be thei don to edificacioun .
46014027	Whether a man spekith in tunge , bi twei men , ethir thre at the moste , and bi partis , that oon interprete .
46014028	But if there be not an interpretour , be he stille in the chirche , and speke he to hym silf and to God .
46014029	Prophetis tweine or thre seie , and othere wiseli deme .
46014030	But if ony thing be schewid to a sittere , the formere be stille .
46014031	For ye moun ` prophecie alle , ech bi hym silf , that alle men lerne , and alle moneste .
46014032	And the spiritis of prophetis ben suget to prophetis ;
46014033	for whi God is not of discencioun , but of pees ; as in alle chirchis of hooli men ` Y teche .
46014034	Wymmen in chirchis be stille ; for it is not suffrid to hem to speke , but to be suget , as the lawe seith .
46014035	But if thei wolen ony thing lerne , ` at home axe thei her hosebondis ; for it is foule thing to a womman to speke in chirche .
46014036	Whether ` of you the word of God cam forth , or to you aloone it cam ?
46014037	If ony man is seyn to be a prophete , or spiritual , knowe he tho thingis that Y write to you , for tho ben the comaundementis of the Lord .
46014038	And if ony man vnknowith , he schal be vnknowun .
46014039	` Therfor , britheren , loue ye to prophecie , and nyle ye forbede to speke in tungis .
46014040	But be alle thingis don onestli , and bi due ordre in you .
46015001	` Sotheli , britheren , Y make the gospel knowun to you , which Y haue prechid to you , the which also ye han takun , in which ye stonden ,
46015002	also bi which ye schulen be sauyd ; ` bi which resoun Y haue prechid to you , if ye holden , ` if ye han not bileuyd ideli .
46015003	For Y bitook to you at the bigynnyng that thing which also Y haue resseyued ; that Crist was deed for oure synnes , bi the scripturis ;
46015004	and that he was biried , and that he roos ayen in the thridde dai , after scripturis ;
46015005	and that he was seyn to Cephas , and aftir these thingis to enleuene ;
46015006	aftirward he was seyn to mo than fyue hundrid britheren togidere , of whiche manye lyuen yit , but summe ben deed ; aftirward he was seyn to James ,
46015007	and aftirward to alle the apostlis .
46015008	And last of alle he was seyn also to me , as to a deed borun child .
46015009	For Y am the leste of apostlis , that am not worthi to be clepid apostle , for Y pursuede the chirche of God .
46015010	But bi the grace of God Y am that thing that Y am ; and his grace was not voide in me . For Y trauelide more plenteuously than alle thei ; but not Y , but the grace of God with me .
46015011	But whether Y , or thei , so we han prechid , and so ye han bileuyd .
46015012	And if Crist is prechid , that he roos ayen fro deeth , hou seien summen among you , that the ayenrisyng of deed men is not ?
46015013	And if the ayenrisyng of deed men is not , nethir Crist roos ayen fro deeth .
46015014	And if Crist roos not , oure preching is veyn , oure feith is veyn .
46015015	And we ben foundun false witnessis of God , for we han seid witnessyng ayens God , that he reiside Crist , whom he reiside not , if deed men risen not ayen .
46015016	Forwhi if deed men risen not ayen , nether Crist roos ayen ;
46015017	and if Crist roos not ayen , oure feith is veyn ; and yit ye ben in youre synnes .
46015018	And thanne thei that han diede in Crist , han perischid .
46015019	If in this life oneli we ben hoping in Crist , we ben more wretchis than alle men .
46015020	But now Crist roos ayen fro deth , the firste fruit of deed men ;
46015021	for deeth was bi a man , and bi a man is ayenrisyng fro deth .
46015022	And as in Adam alle men dien , so in Crist alle men schulen be quykenyd .
46015023	But ech man in his ordre ; the firste fruit , Crist , afterward thei that ben of Crist , that bileueden in the comyng of Crist ;
46015024	aftirward an ende , whanne he schal bitake the kyngdom to God and to the fadir , whanne he schal auoide al princehod , and power , and vertu .
46015025	But it bihoueth hym to regne , til he putte alle hise enemyes vndur hise feet .
46015026	And at the laste , deth the enemye schal be distried ; for he hath maad suget alle thingis vndur hise feet .
46015027	And whanne he seith , alle thingis ben suget to hym , with outen doubt outakun hym that sugetide alle thingis to hym .
46015028	And whanne alle thingis ben suget to hym , thanne the sone hym silf schal be suget to hym , that made ` alle thingis suget to hym , that God be alle thingis in alle thingis .
46015029	Ellis what schulen thei do , that ben baptisid for deed men , if in no wise deed men risen ayen ? wherto ben thei baptisid for hem ?
46015030	And wherto ben we in perel euery our ?
46015031	Ech dai Y die for youre glorie , britheren , which glorie Y haue in Crist Jhesu oure Lord .
46015032	If aftir man Y haue fouyten to beestis at Efesi , what profitith it to me , if deed men risen not ayen ? Ete we , and drynke we , for we schulen die to morewe .
46015033	Nyle ye be disseyued ; for yuel spechis distrien good thewis .
46015034	Awake ye , iuste men , and nyle ye do synne ; for summen han ignoraunce of God , but to reuerence Y speke to you .
46015035	But summan seith , Hou schulen deed men rise ayen , or in what maner bodi schulen thei come ?
46015036	Vnwise man , that thing that thou sowist , is not quykened , but it die first ;
46015037	and that thing that thou sowist , ` thou sowist not the bodi that is to come , but a nakid corn , as of whete , or of summe othere seedis ;
46015038	and God yyueth to it a bodi , as he wole , and to ech of seedis a propir bodi .
46015039	Not ech fleisch is the same fleisch , but oon is of men , another is of beestis , another is of briddis , an othere of fischis .
46015040	And ` heuenli bodies ben , and ` ertheli bodies ben ; but oon glorie is of heuenely bodies , and anothir is of ertheli .
46015041	An othere clerenesse is of the sunne , anothere clerenesse is of the moone , and anothere clerenesse is of sterris ; and a sterre dyuersith fro a sterre in clerenesse .
46015042	And so the ayenrisyng of deed men . It is sowun in corrupcioun , it schal rise in vncorrupcioun ;
46015043	it is sowun in vnnoblei , it schal rise in glorie ; it is sowun in infirmyte , it schal rise in vertu ;
46015044	it is sowun a beestly bodi , it schal rise a spiritual bodi . If ther is a beestli bodi , ther is also a spiritual bodi ;
46015045	as it is writun , The firste man Adam was maad in to a soule lyuynge , the laste Adam in to a spirit quykenynge .
46015046	But the firste is not that that is spiritual , but that that is beestlich , aftirward that that is spiritual .
46015047	The firste man of erthe is ertheli ; the secounde man of heuene is heuenelich .
46015048	Such as the ertheli man is , such ben the ertheli men ; and such as the heueneli man is , suche ben also the heueneli men .
46015049	Therfor as we han bore the ymage of the ertheli man , bere we also the ymage of the heuenli .
46015050	Britheren , Y seie this thing , that fleisch and bloud moun not welde the kyngdom of God , nethir corrupcioun schal welde vncorrupcioun .
46015051	Lo ! Y seie to you priuyte of hooli thingis . And alle we schulen rise ayen , but not alle we schulen be chaungid ;
46015052	in a moment , in the twynklyng of an iye , in the laste trumpe ; for the trumpe schal sowne , and deed men schulen rise ayen , with oute corrupcioun , and we schulen be chaungid .
46015053	For it byhoueth this corruptible thing to clothe vncorrupcioun , and this deedli thing to putte awei vndeedlinesse .
46015054	But whanne this deedli thing schal clothe vndeedlynesse , thanne schal the word be doon , that is writun , Deth is sopun vp in victorie .
46015055	Deth , where is thi victorie ? Deth , where is thi pricke ?
46015056	But the pricke of deth is synne ; and the vertu of synne is the lawe .
46015057	But do we thankyngis to God , that yaf to vs victorie bi oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
46015058	Therfore , my dereworthe britheren , be ye stidefast , and vnmouable , beynge plenteuouse in werk of the Lord , euere more witynge that youre trauel is not idel in the Lord .
46016001	But of the gaderyngis of money that ben maad in to seyntis , as Y ordeynede in the chirchis of Galathie , so also do ye o dai of the wouke .
46016002	Ech of you kepe at hym silf , kepynge that that plesith to him , that whanne Y come , the gaderyngis ben not maad .
46016003	And whanne Y schal be present , whiche men ye preuen , Y schal sende hem bi epistlis to bere youre grace in to Jerusalem .
46016004	That if it be worthi that also Y go , thei schulen go with me .
46016005	But Y schal come to you , whanne Y schal passe bi Macedonye ; for whi Y schal passe bi Macedonye .
46016006	But perauenture Y schal dwelle at you , or also dwelle the wynter , that and ye lede me whidir euere Y schal go .
46016007	And Y wole not now se you in my passyng , for Y hope to dwelle with you awhile , if the Lord schal suffre .
46016008	But Y schal dwelle at Efesi , ` til to Witsuntide .
46016009	For a grete dore and an opyn is openyd to me , and many aduersaries .
46016010	And if Thimothe come , se ye that he be with out drede with you , for he worcheth the werk of the Lord , as Y .
46016011	Therfor no man dispise hym ; but lede ye hym forth in pees , that he come to me ; for Y abide hym with britheren .
46016012	But , britheren , Y make knowun to you of Apollo , that Y preiede him myche , that he schulde come to you , with britheren . But it was not his wille to come now ; but he schal come , whanne he schal haue leiser .
46016013	Walke ye , and stonde ye in the feith ; do ye manli , and be ye coumfortid in the Lord ,
46016014	and be alle youre thingis don in charite .
46016015	And , britheren , Y biseche you , ye knowen the hous of Stephan , and of Fortunati , and Acaicy , for thei ben the firste fruytis of Acaie , and in to mynystrie of seyntis thei han ordeyned hem silf ;
46016016	that also ye be sugetis to suche , and to ech worchynge togidere and trauelynge .
46016017	For Y haue ioie in the presence of Stephan , and of Fortunate , and Acaici ;
46016018	for thei filliden that thing that failide to you ; for thei han refreischid bothe my spirit and youre . Therfor knowe ye hem , that ben suche maner men .
46016019	Alle the chirchis of Asie greten you wel . Aquila and Prisca , with her homeli chirche , greten you myche in the Lord , at the whiche also Y am herborid .
46016020	Alle bretheren greten you wel . Grete ye wel togidere in hooli cos .
46016021	My gretyng bi Poulis hoond .
46016022	If ony man loueth not oure Lord Jhesu Crist , be he cursid , Maranatha .
46016023	The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with you .
46016024	My charite be with you alle in Crist Jhesu oure Lord . Amen .
47001001	Poul , apostle of Jhesu Crist , bi the wille of God , and Tymothe , brothir , to the chirche of God that is at Corinthi , with alle seyntis that ben in al Acaie , grace to you ,
47001002	and pees of God oure fadir and of the Lord Jhesu Crist .
47001003	Blessid be God and the fadir of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , fadir of mercies , and God of al coumfort ,
47001004	which coumfortith vs in al oure tribulacioun , that also we moun coumforte hem , that ben in al diseese , bi the monestyng bi which also we ben monestid of God .
47001005	For as the passiouns of Crist ben plenteuouse in vs , so also bi Crist oure coumfort is plenteuouse .
47001006	And whether we ben in tribulacioun , for youre tribulacioun and heelthe , ethir we ben coumfortid , for youre coumfort , ethir we ben monestid , for youre monestyng and heelthe . Which worchith in you the suffring of the same passiouns , whiche ` we also suffren ,
47001007	that oure hope be sad for you ; witynge for as ye ben felowis of passiouns , so ye schulen ben also of coumfort .
47001008	For , britheren , we wolen that ye wite of oure tribulacioun , that was don in Asie ; for ouer maner we weren greued ouer myyt , so that it anoiede vs , yhe , to lyue .
47001009	But we in vs silf hadden answere of deth , that we truste not in vs , but in God that reisith deed men .
47001010	Which delyuerede vs , and delyuerith fro so grete perelis , in to whom we hopen , also yit he schal delyuere ,
47001011	while also ye helpen in preier for vs ; that of the persones of many faces of that yyuyng that is in vs , thankyngis ben don for vs bi many men to God .
47001012	For oure glorie is this , the witnessyng of oure conscience , that in symplenesse and clennesse of God , and not in fleischli wisdom , but in the grace of God , we lyueden in this world , but more plenteuousli to you .
47001013	And we writen not othere thingis to you , than tho that ye han red and knowe , and Y hope that in to the ende ye schulen knowe ,
47001014	as also ye han knowe vs a parti ; for we ben youre glorie , as also ye ben oure in the dai of oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
47001015	And in this tristyng Y wolde first come to you , that ye schulden haue the secounde grace ,
47001016	and passe bi you in to Macedonye , and eft fro Macedonye come to you , and of you be led in to Judee .
47001017	But whanne Y wolde this thing , whether Y vside vnstidfastnesse , ether tho thingis that Y thenke , Y thenke aftir the fleisch , that at me be , it is and it is not ?
47001018	But God is trewe , for oure word that was at you is and is not , is not ther ynne , but is is in it .
47001019	For whi Jhesus Crist , the sone of God , which is prechid among you bi vs , bi me , and Syluan , and Tymothe , ther was not in hym is and is not , but is was in hym .
47001020	For whi hou many euer ben biheestis of God , in thilke is , ` that is , ben fillid . And therfor and bi hym we seien amen to God , to oure glorie .
47001021	Sotheli it is God that confermeth vs with you in Crist , and the which God anoyntide vs ,
47001022	and which markide vs , and yaf ernes of the spirit in oure hertis .
47001023	For Y clepide God to witnesse ayens my soule , that Y sparynge you cam not ouer to Corynthe ;
47001024	not that we ben lordis of youre feith , but we ben helperis of youre ioye ; for thorouy bileue ye stonden .
47002001	And Y ordeynede this ilke thing at me , that Y schulde not come eftsoone in heuynes to you .
47002002	For if Y make you sori , who is he that gladith me , but he that is soreuful of me ?
47002003	And this same thing Y wroot to you , that whanne Y come , Y haue not sorewe on sorewe , of the whiche it behofte me to haue ioie . And Y triste in you alle , that my ioye is of alle you .
47002004	For of myche tribulacioun and angwisch of herte Y wroot to you by many teeris , not that ye be sori , but that ye wite what charite Y haue more plenteuously in you .
47002005	For if ony man hath maad me soreuful , he hath not maad me sorewful but a parti , that Y charge not you alle .
47002006	This blamyng that ys maad of manye , suffisith to hym , that is sich oon ;
47002007	so that ayenward ye rathir foryyuen and coumfort , lest perauenture he that is suche a maner man , be sopun vp bi more grete heuynesse .
47002008	For which thing Y biseche you , that ye conferme charite in to hym .
47002009	For whi therfor Y wroot this , that Y knowe youre preuyng , whether in alle thingis ye ben obedient .
47002010	For to whom ye han foryyuen ony thing , also Y haue foryyue . For Y that that Y foryaf , yif Y foryaf ony thing , haue youun for you in the persone of Crist ,
47002011	that we be not disseyued of Sathanas ; for we knowen hise thouytis .
47002012	But whanne Y was comun to Troade for the gospel of Crist , and a dore was opened to me in the Lord ,
47002013	Y hadde not rest to my spirit , for Y foond not my brother Tite , but Y seide to hem farewel , and Y passide in to Macedonye .
47002014	And Y do thankyngis to God , that euere more makith vs to haue victorie in Crist Jhesu , and schewith bi vs the odour of his knowing in ech place ;
47002015	for we ben the good odour of Crist to God , among these that ben maad saaf , and among these that perischen .
47002016	To othere sotheli odour of deth in to deth , but to othere we ben odour of lijf in to lijf . And to these thingis who is so able ?
47002017	For we ben not as many , that don auoutrie bi the word of God , but we speken of clennesse , as of God , bifor God in Crist .
47003001	Bigynnen we therfor eftsoone to preise vs silf ? or whether we neden , as summen , pistlis of preisinge to you , or of you ?
47003002	Ye ben oure pistle , writun in oure hertis , which is knowun and red of alle men ,
47003003	and maad opyn , for ye ben the pistle of Crist mynystrid of vs , and writun , not with enke , but bi the spirit of the lyuynge God ; not in stony tablis , but in fleischli tablis of herte .
47003004	For we han such trist bi Crist to God ;
47003005	not that we ben sufficient to thenke ony thing of vs , as of vs , but oure sufficience is of God .
47003006	Which also made vs able mynystris of the newe testament , not bi lettre , but bi spirit ; for the lettre sleeth , but the spirit quykeneth .
47003007	And if the mynystracioun of deth write bi lettris in stoonys was in glorie , so that the children of Israel myyten not biholde in to the face of Moises , for the glorie of his cheer , which is auoidid ,
47003008	hou schal not the mynystracioun of the spirit be more in glorie ?
47003009	For if the mynystracioun of dampnacioun was in glorie , myche more the mynysterie of riytwisnesse is plenteuouse in glorie .
47003010	For nether that that was cleer was glorified in this part for the excellent glorie ; and if that that is auoidid ,
47003011	was bi glorie , myche more that that dwellith stille is in glorie .
47003012	Therfor we that han suche hope , vsen myche trist ;
47003013	and not as Moises leide a veil on his face , that the children of Israel schulden not biholde in to his face , which veil is auoidid .
47003014	But the wittis of hem ben astonyed ; for in to this dai the same veil in reding of the olde testament dwellith not schewid , for it is auoidid in Crist , but in to this dai ,
47003015	whanne Moises is red , the veil is put on her hertis .
47003016	But whanne Israel schal be conuertid to God , the veil schal be don awei .
47003017	And the spirit is the Lord ; and where the spirit of the Lord is , there is fredom .
47003018	And alle we that with open face seen the glorie of the Lord , ben transformed in to the same ymage , fro clerenesse in to clerenesse , as of the spirit of the Lord .
47004001	Therfor we that han this admynystracioun , aftir this that we han getun merci ,
47004002	faile we not , but do we awei the preue thingis of schame , not walkinge in sutil gile , nether doynge auoutrye bi the word of God , but in schewynge of the treuthe comendynge vs silf to ech conscience of men bifor God .
47004003	For if also oure gospel is kyuerid , in these that perischen it is kyuerid ;
47004004	in which God hath blent the soulis of vnfeithful men of this world , that the liytnyng of the gospel of the glorie of Crist , which is the ymage of God , schyne not .
47004005	But we prechen not vs silf , but oure Lord Jhesu Crist ; and vs youre seruauntis bi Jhesu .
47004006	For God , that seide liyt to schyne of derknessis , he hath youe liyt in oure hertis , to the liytnyng of the science of the clerenesse of God , in the face of Jhesu Crist .
47004007	And we han this tresour in britil vessels , that the worthinesse be of Goddis vertu , and not of vs .
47004008	In alle thingis we suffren tribulacioun , but we ben not angwischid , or annoyed ; we ben maad pore , but ` we lacken nothing ; we suffren persecucioun ,
47004009	but we ben not forsakun ; we ben maad lowe , but we ben not confoundid ; we ben cast doun , but we perischen not .
47004010	And euere more we beren aboute the sleyng of Jhesu in oure bodi , that also the lijf of Jhesu be schewid in oure bodies .
47004011	For euere more we that lyuen , ben takun in to deth for Jhesu , that the lijf of Jhesu be schewid in oure deedli fleisch .
47004012	Therfor deth worchith in vs , but lijf worchith in you .
47004013	And we han the same spirit of feith , as it is writun , Y haue bileuyd , Y haue spoke ; and we bileuen , wherfor also we speken ;
47004014	witynge that he that reiside Jhesu , schal reise also vs with Jhesu , and schal ordeyne with you .
47004015	And alle thingis for you , that a plenteuouse grace bi many thankyngis be plenteuouse in to the glorie of God .
47004016	For which thing we failen not , for thouy oure vtter man be corruptid ; netheles the ynner man is renewid fro dai to dai .
47004017	But that liyt thing of oure tribulacioun that lastith now , but as it were by a moment , worchith in vs ouer mesure an euerlastynge birthin in to the heiynesse of glorie ;
47004018	while that we biholden not tho thingis that ben seyn , but tho that ben not seyn . For tho thingis that ben seyn , ben but durynge for a schort tyme ; but tho thingis that ben not seyn , ben euerlastynge .
47005001	And we witen , that if oure ertheli hous of this dwellynge be dissoluyd , that we han a bildyng of God , an hous not maad bi hondis , euerlastynge in heuenes .
47005002	For whi in this thing we mornen , coueitynge to be clothid aboue with oure dwellyng , which is of heuene ; if netheles we ben foundun clothid ,
47005003	and not nakid .
47005004	For whi and we that ben in this tabernacle , sorewen with ynne , and ben heuyed , for that we wolen not be spuylid , but be clothid aboue ; that the ilke thing that is deedli , be sopun vp of lijf .
47005005	But who is it that makith vs in to this same thing ? God , that yaf to vs the ernes of the spirit .
47005006	Therfor we ben hardi algatis , and witen that the while we ben in this bodi , we goen in pilgrymage fro the Lord ;
47005007	for we walken bi feith , and not bi cleer siyt .
47005008	But we ben hardi , and han good wille , more to be in pilgrymage fro the bodi , and to be present to God .
47005009	And therfor we stryuen , whether absent , whether present , to plese hym .
47005010	For it bihoueth vs alle to be schewid bifor the trone of Crist , that euery man telle the propre thingis of the bodi , as he hath don , ethir good , ether yuel .
47005011	Therfor we witynge the drede of the Lord , councelen men , for to God we ben opyn ; and Y hope , that we ben opyn also in youre consciencis .
47005012	We comenden not vs silf eftsoone to you , but we yyuen to you occasioun to haue glorie for vs , that ye haue to hem that glorien in the face , and not in the herte .
47005013	For ethir we bi mynde passen to God , ether we ben sobre to you .
47005014	For the charite of Crist dryueth vs ; gessynge this thing , that if oon died for alle , thanne alle weren deed .
47005015	And Crist diede for alle , that thei that lyuen , lyue not now to hem silf , but to hym that diede for hem , and roos ayen .
47005016	Therfor we fro this tyme knowen no man aftir the fleische ; thouy we knowun Crist aftir the fleisch , but nowe we knowun not .
47005017	Therfor if ony newe creature is in Crist , the elde thingis ben passid .
47005018	And lo ! alle thingis ben of God , which recounselide vs to hym bi Crist , and yaf to vs the seruyce of recounselyng .
47005019	And God was in Crist , recounselynge to hym the world , not rettynge to hem her giltes , and puttide in vs the word of recounselyng .
47005020	Therfor we vsen message for Crist , as if God monestith bi vs ; we bisechen for Crist , be ye recounselid to God .
47005021	God the fadir made hym synne for vs , which knewe not synne , that we schulden be maad riytwisnesse of God in hym .
47006001	But we helpynge monesten , that ye resseyuen not the grace of God in veyn .
47006002	For he seith , In tyme wel plesinge Y haue herd thee , and in the dai of heelthe Y haue helpid thee . Lo ! now a tyme acceptable , lo ! now a dai of heelthe .
47006003	Yyue we to no man ony offencioun , that oure seruyce be not repreued ;
47006004	but in alle thingis yyue we vs silf as the mynystris of God , in myche pacience , in tribulaciouns ,
47006005	in nedis , in angwischis , in betyngis , in prisouns , in dissensiouns with ynne , in trauels , in wakyngis , in fastyngis ,
47006006	in chastite , in kunnyng , in long abiding , in swetnesse , in the Hooli Goost ,
47006007	in charite not feined , in the word of treuthe , in the vertu of God ; bi armeris of riytwisnesse on the riythalf and on the lefthalf ;
47006008	bi glorie and vnnoblei ; bi yuel fame and good fame ; as disseyueris , and trewe men ; as thei that ben vnknowun , and knowun ;
47006009	as men diynge , and lo ! we lyuen ; as chastisid , and not maad deed ;
47006010	as sorewful , euere more ioiynge ; as hauynge nede , but makynge many men riche ; as no thing hauynge , and weldynge alle thingis .
47006011	A ! ye Corynthies , oure mouth is open to you , oure herte is alargid ;
47006012	ye ben not angwischid in vs , but ye ben anguischid in youre inwardnessis .
47006013	And Y seie as to sones , ye that han the same reward , be ye alargid .
47006014	Nyle ye bere the yok with vnfeithful men . For what parting of riytwisnes with wickidnesse ? or what felouschipe of liyt to derknessis ?
47006015	and what acording of Crist to Belial ? or what part of a feithful with the vnfeithful ?
47006016	and what consent to the temple of God with mawmetis ? And ye ben the temple of the lyuynge God , as the Lord seith , For Y schal dwelle in hem , and Y schal walke among hem ; and Y schal be God of hem , and thei schulen be a puple to me .
47006017	For which thing go ye out of the myddil of hem , and be ye departid , seith the Lord , and touche ye not vnclene thing ;
47006018	and Y schal resseyue you , and schal be to you in to a fadir , and ye schulen be to me in to sones and douytris , seith the Lord almyyti .
47007001	Therfor , most dereworthe britheren , we that han these biheestis , clense we vs fro al filthe of the fleische and of the spirit , doynge holynesse in the drede of God .
47007002	Take ye vs ; we han hirt no man , we han apeirid no man , we han bigilid no man .
47007003	Y seie not to youre condempnyng ; for Y seide bifor , that ye ben in youre hertis , to die togidere and to lyue togidere .
47007004	Myche trist is to me anentis you , myche gloriyng is to me for you . Y am fillid with coumfort , Y am plenteuouse in ioie in al oure tribulacioun .
47007005	For whanne we weren comun to Macedonye , oure fleisch hadde no reste , but we suffriden al tribulacioun ; with outforth fiytingis , and dredis with ynne .
47007006	But God that coumfortith meke men , coumfortide vs in the comyng of Tite .
47007007	And not oneli in the comyng of him , but also in the coumfort bi which he was coumfortid in you , tellinge to vs youre desire , youre weping , youre loue for me , so that Y ioiede more .
47007008	For thouy Y made you sorie in a pistle , it rewith me not ; thouy it rewide , seynge that thouy thilke pistle made you sori at an our , now Y haue ioie ;
47007009	not for ye weren maad soreuful , but for ye weren maad soreuful to penaunce . For whi ye ben maad sori aftir God , that in no thing ye suffre peirement of vs .
47007010	For the sorewe that is aftir God , worchith penaunce in to stidfast heelthe ; but sorewe of the world worchith deth .
47007011	For lo ! this same thing , that ye ben soreuful aftir God , hou myche bisynesse it worchith in you ; but defendyng , but indignacioun , but drede , but desire , but loue , but veniaunce . In alle thingis ye han youun you silf to be vndefoulid in the cause .
47007012	Therfor thouy Y wroot to you , Y wroot not for hym that dide the iniurie , nether for hym that suffride , but to schewe oure bisinesse , which we han for you bifor God .
47007013	Therfor we ben coumfortid , but in youre coumfort more plenteuousli we ioyeden more on the ioie of Tite , for his spirit is fulfillid of alle you .
47007014	And if Y gloriede ony thing anentis hym of you , Y am not confoundid ; but as we han spoke to you alle thingis , so also oure glorie that was at Tite , is maad treuthe .
47007015	And the inwardnesse of hym be more plenteuousli in you , which hath in mynde the obedience of you alle , hou with drede and trembling ye resseyueden hym .
47007016	Y haue ioye , that in alle thingis Y triste in you .
47008001	But , britheren , we maken knowun to you the grace of God , that is youun in the chirchis of Macedonye ,
47008002	that in myche asaiyng of tribulacioun , the plente of the ioye of hem was , and the hiyeste pouert of hem was plenteuouse ` in to the richessis of the symplenesse of hem .
47008003	For Y bere witnessyng to hem , aftir miyt and aboue miyt thei weren wilful ,
47008004	with myche monestyng bisechynge vs the grace and the comynyng of mynystring , that is maad to hooli men .
47008005	And not as we hopiden , but thei yauen hem silf first to the Lord , aftirward to vs bi the wille of God .
47008006	So that we preyeden Tite , that as he bigan , so also he performe in you this grace .
47008007	But as ye abounden in alle thingis , in feith , and word , and kunnyng , and al bisynesse , more ouer and in youre charite in to vs , that and in this grace ye abounden .
47008008	Y seie not as comaundinge , but bi the bisynesse of othere men appreuynge also the good wit of youre charite .
47008009	And ye witen the grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , for he was maad nedi for you , whanne he was riche , that ye schulden be maad riche bi his nedynesse .
47008010	And Y yyue counsel in this thing ; for this is profitable to you , that not oneli han bigunne to do , but also ye bigunnen to haue wille fro the formere yere .
47008011	But now parfourme ye in deed , that as the discrecioun of wille is redi , so be it also of parformyng of that that ye han .
47008012	For if the wille be redi , it is acceptid aftir that that it hath , not aftir that that it hath not .
47008013	And not that it be remyssioun to othere men , and to you tribulacioun ;
47008014	but of euenesse in the present tyme youre aboundance fulfille the myseese of hem , that also the aboundaunce of hem be a fulfillynge of youre myseise , that euenesse be maad ; as it is writun ,
47008015	He that gaderide myche , was not encresid , and he that gaderide litil , hadde not lesse .
47008016	And Y do thankyngis to God , that yaf the same bisynesse for you in the herte of Tite ,
47008017	for he resseyuede exortacioun ; but whanne he was bisier , bi his wille he wente forth to you .
47008018	And we senten with hym a brother , whose preisyng is in the gospel bi alle chirchis .
47008019	And not oneli , but also he is ordeyned of chirchis the felowe of oure pilgrimage in to this grace , that is mynystrid of vs to the glorie of the Lord , and to oure ordeyned wille ;
47008020	eschewynge this thing , that no man blame vs in this plente , that is mynystrid of vs to the glorye of the Lord .
47008021	For we purueyen good thingis , not onely bifor God , but also bifor alle men .
47008022	For we senten with hem also oure brothir , whom we han preued in many thingis ofte , that he was bisi , but nowe myche bisier , for myche trist in you ,
47008023	ethir for Tite , that is my felowe and helpere in you , ethir for oure britheren , apostlis of the chirches of the glorie of Crist .
47008024	Therfor schewe ye in to hem in the face of chirchis , that schewynge that is of youre charite and of oure glorie for you .
47009001	For of the mynystrie that is maad to hooli men , it is to me of plente to write to you .
47009002	For Y knowe youre wille , for the which Y haue glorie of you anentis Macedonyes , for also Acaie is redi fro a yeer passid , and youre loue hath stirid ful manye .
47009003	And we han sent britheren , that this thing that we glorien of you , be not auoidid in this parti , that as Y seide , ye be redi .
47009004	Lest whanne Macedonyes comen with me , and fynden you vnredi , we be schamed , that we seien you not , in this substaunce .
47009005	Therfor Y gesside necessarie to preie britheren , that thei come bifore to you , and make redi this bihiyt blessyng to be redi , so as blessing , and not as aueryce .
47009006	For Y seie this thing , he that sowith scarseli , schal also repe scarseli ; and he that sowith in blessyngis , schal ` repe also of blessyngis .
47009007	Ech man as he castide in his herte , not of heuynesse , or of nede ; for God loueth a glad yyuere .
47009008	And God is miyti to make al grace abounde in you , that ye in alle thingis euere more han al sufficience , and abounde in to al good werk ;
47009009	as it is writun , He delide abrood , he yaf to pore men , his riytwisnesse dwellith withouten ende .
47009010	And he that mynystrith seed to the sowere , schal yyue also breed to ete , and he schal multiplie youre seed , and make myche the encreessingis of fruytis of youre riytwisnesse ;
47009011	that in alle thingis ye maad riche waxen plenteuouse in to al symplenesse , which worchith bi vs doing of thankingis to God .
47009012	For the mynystrie of this office not oneli fillith tho thingis that failen to holi men , but also multiplieth many thankyngis to God ,
47009013	bi the preuyng of this mynystrie , which glorifien God in the obedience of youre knouleching in the gospel of Crist , and in symplenesse of comynycacioun in to hem and in to alle ,
47009014	and in the biseching of hem for you , that desiren you for the excellent grace of God in you .
47009015	Y do thankyngis to God of the yifte of hym , that may not be teld .
47010001	And Y my silf Poul biseche you , bi the myldenesse and softnesse of Crist , which in the face am meke among you , and Y absent triste in you .
47010002	For Y preie you , that lest Y present be not bold bi the trist , in which Y am gessid to be bold in to summe , that demen vs , as if we wandren aftir the fleisch .
47010003	For we walkynge in fleisch , fiyten not aftir the fleisch .
47010004	For the armuris of oure knyythod ben not fleischli , but myyti bi God to the distruccioun of strengthis . And we distrien counsels ,
47010005	and alle hiynesse that hiyeth it silf ayens the science of God , and dryuen ` in to caitifte al vndirstonding in to the seruyce of Crist .
47010006	And we han redi to venge al vnobedience , whanne youre obedience schal be fillid .
47010007	Se ye the thingis that ben after the face . If ony man trustith to him silf , that he is of Crist , thenke he this thing eft anentis hym silf ,
47010008	for as he is Cristis , so also we . For if Y schal glorie ony thing more of oure power , which the Lord yaf to vs in to edifiyng , and not in to youre distruccioun , Y schal not be schamed .
47010009	But that Y be not gessid as to fere you bi epistlis ,
47010010	for thei seien , That epistlis ben greuouse and stronge , but the presence of the bodi is feble , and the word worthi to be dispisid .
47010011	He that is suche oon , thenke this , for suche as we absent ben in word bi pistlis , suche we ben present in dede .
47010012	For we doren not putte vs among , or comparisoune vs to summen , that comenden hem silf ; but we mesuren vs in vs silf , and comparisounen vs silf to vs .
47010013	For we schulen not haue glorie ouer mesure , but bi the mesure of the reule which God mesuride to vs , the mesure that stretchith to you .
47010014	For we ouerstretchen not forth vs , as not stretchinge to you . For to you we camen in the gospel of Crist ,
47010015	not gloriynge ouer mesure in othere mennus trauelis . For we ` han hope of youre feith that wexith in you to be magnefied bi oure reule in abundaunce ,
47010016	also to preche in to tho thingis that ben biyendis you , not to haue glorie in othere mennus reule , in these thingis that ben maad redi .
47010017	He that glorieth , haue glorie in the Lord .
47010018	For not he that comendith hym silf is preuyd , but whom God comendith .
47011001	I wolde that ye wolden suffre a litil thing of myn vnwisdom , but also supporte ye me .
47011002	For Y loue you bi the loue of God ; for Y haue spousid you to oon hosebonde , to yelde a chast virgyn to Crist .
47011003	But Y drede , lest as the serpent disseyuede Eue with his sutil fraude , so youre wittis ben corrupt , and fallen doun fro the symplenesse that is in Crist .
47011004	For if he that cometh , prechith anothir Crist , whom we precheden not , or if ye taken another spirit , whom ye token not , or another gospel , which ye resseyueden not , riytli ye schulden suffre .
47011005	For Y wene that Y haue don no thing lesse than the grete apostlis .
47011006	For thouy Y be vnlerud in word , but not in kunnyng . For in alle thingis Y am open to you .
47011007	Or whether Y haue don synne , mekynge my silf , that ye be enhaunsid , for freli Y prechide to you the gospel of God ?
47011008	Y made nakid othere chirchis , and Y took sowde to youre seruyce .
47011009	And whanne Y was among you , and hadde nede , Y was chargeouse to no man ; for britheren that camen fro Macedonye , fulfilliden that that failide to me . And in alle thingis Y haue kept , and schal kepe me with outen charge to you .
47011010	The treuthe of Crist is in me ; for this glorie schal not be brokun in me in the cuntreis of Acaie .
47011011	Whi ? for Y loue not you ?
47011012	God woot . For that that Y do , and that Y schal do , is that Y kitte awei the occasioun of hem that wolen occasioun , that in the thing , in which thei glorien , thei be foundun as we .
47011013	For siche false apostlis ben trecherouse werk men , and transfiguren hem in to apostlis of Crist .
47011014	And no wondur , for Sathanas hym silf transfigurith hym in to an aungel of light .
47011015	Therfor it is not greet , if hise mynystris ben transfigurid as the mynystris of riytwisnesse , whos ende schal be aftir her werkis .
47011016	Eft Y seie , lest ony man gesse me to be vnwise ; ellis take ye me as vnwise , that also Y haue glorie a litil what .
47011017	That that Y speke , Y speke not aftir God , but as in vnwisdom , in this substaunce of glorie .
47011018	For many men glorien aftir the fleisch , and Y schal glorie .
47011019	For ye suffren gladli vnwise men , whanne ye silf ben wise .
47011020	For ye susteynen , if ony man dryueth you in to seruage , if ony man deuourith , if ony man takith , if ony man is enhaunsid , if ony man smytith you on the face .
47011021	Bi vnnoblei Y seie , as if we weren sike in this parti . In what thing ony man dar , in vnwisdom Y seie , and Y dar .
47011022	Thei ben Ebrewis , and Y ; thei ben Israelitis , and Y ; thei ben the seed of Abraham , and Y ;
47011023	thei ben the mynystris of Crist , and Y . As lesse wise Y seie , Y more ; in ful many trauelis , in prisouns more plenteuousli , in woundis aboue maner , in deethis ofte tymes .
47011024	Y resseyuede of the Jewis fyue sithis fourti strokis oon lesse ;
47011025	thries Y was betun with yerdis , onys Y was stonyd , thries Y was at shipbreche , a nyyt and a dai Y was in the depnesse of the see ;
47011026	in weies ofte , in perelis of floodis , in perelis of theues , in perelis of kyn , in perelis of hethene men , in perelis in citee , in perelis in desert , in perelis in the see , in perelis among false britheren , in trauel and nedynesse ,
47011027	in many wakyngis , in hungur , in thirst , in many fastyngis , in coold and nakidnesse .
47011028	Withouten tho thingis that ben withoutforth , myn ech daies trauelyng is the bisynesse of alle chirchis .
47011029	Who is sijk , and Y am not sijk ? who is sclaundrid , and Y am not brent ?
47011030	If it bihoueth to glorie , Y schal glorie in tho thingis that ben of myn infirmyte .
47011031	God and the fadir of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , that is blessid in to worldis , woot that Y lie not .
47011032	The preuost of Damask , of the kyng of the folk Arethe , kepte the citee of Damascenes to take me ;
47011033	and bi a wyndow in a leep Y was latun doun bi the wal , and so Y ascapide hise hondis .
47012001	If it bihoueth to haue glorie , it spedith not ; but Y schal come to the visiouns and to the reuelaciouns of the Lord .
47012002	I woot a man in Crist that bifore fouretene yeer ; whether in bodi , whether out of the bodi , Y woot not , God woot ; that siche a man was rauyschid ` til to the thridde heuene .
47012003	And Y woot sich a man ; whether in bodi , or out of bodi , Y noot , God woot ;
47012004	that he was rauyschid in to paradis , and herde preuy wordis , whiche it is not leueful to a man to speke .
47012005	For such maner thingis Y schal glorie ; but for me no thing , no but in myn infirmytees .
47012006	For if Y schal wilne to glorie , Y schal not be vnwijs , for Y schal seie treuthe ; but Y spare , lest ony man gesse me ouer that thing that he seeth in me , or herith ony thing of me .
47012007	And lest the greetnesse of reuelaciouns enhaunse me in pride , the pricke of my fleisch , an aungel of Sathanas , is youun to me , that he buffate me .
47012008	For whiche thing thries Y preiede the Lord , that it schulde go awei fro me .
47012009	And he seide to me , My grace suffisith to thee ; for vertu is parfitli maad in infirmyte . Therfor gladli Y schal glorie in myn infirmytees , that the vertu of Crist dwelle in me .
47012010	For which thing Y am plesid in myn infirmytees , in dispisyngis , in nedis , in persecuciouns , in anguyschis , for Crist ; for whanne Y am sijk , thanne Y am miyti .
47012011	Y am maad vnwitti , ye constreyneden me . For Y ouyte to be comendid of you ; for Y dide no thing lesse than thei that ben apostlis ` aboue maner .
47012012	Thouy Y am nouyt , netheles the signes of myn apostilhed ben maad on you , in al pacience , and signes , and grete wondris , and vertues .
47012013	And what is it , that ye hadden lesse than othere chirchis , but that Y my silf greuyde you not ? Foryyue ye to me this wrong .
47012014	Lo ! this thridde tyme Y am redi to come to you , and Y schal not be greuous to you ; for Y seke not tho thingis that ben youre , but you . For nether sones owen to tresoure to fadir and modir , but the fadir and modir to the sones .
47012015	For Y schal yyue moost wilfuli , and Y my silf schal be youun aboue for youre soulis ; thouy Y more loue you , and be lesse louyd .
47012016	But be it ; Y greuyde not you , but whanne Y was sutil , Y took you with gile .
47012017	Whether Y disseyuede you bi ony of hem , which Y sente to you ?
47012018	Y preiede Tite , and Y sente with hym a brother . Whether Tite begilide you ? whether we yeden not in the same spirit ? whether not in the same steppis ?
47012019	Sum tyme ye wenen , that we schulen excuse vs anentis you . Bifor God in Crist we speken ; and , moost dere britheren , alle thingis for youre edifiyng .
47012020	But Y drede , lest whanne Y come , Y schal fynde you not suche as Y wole , and Y schal be foundun of you suche as ye wolen not ; lest perauenture stryuyngis , enuyes , sturdynessis , dissenciouns and detraccions , preuy spechis of discord , bolnyngis bi pride , debatis ben among you ;
47012021	and lest eftsoone whanne Y come , God make me low anentis you , and Y biweile many of hem , that bifor synneden , and diden not penaunce on the vnclennesse , and fornicacioun , and vnchastite , that thei han don .
47013001	Lo ! this thridde tyme Y come to you , and in the mouth of tweyne or of thre witnessis euery word schal stonde .
47013002	Y seide bifor , and seie bifor , as present twies , and now absent , to hem that bifor han synned , and to alle othere ; for if Y come eftsoone , Y schal not spare .
47013003	Whether ye seken the preef of that Crist , that spekith in me , which is not feble in you ?
47013004	For thouy he was crucified of infirmyte , but he lyueth of the vertu of God . For also we ben sijk in hym , but we schulen lyue with him of the vertu of God in vs .
47013005	Asaie you silf , if ye ben in the feith ; ye you silf preue . Whether ye knowen not you silf , for Crist Jhesu is in you ? but in happe ye ben repreuable .
47013006	But Y hope , that ye knowen , that we ben not repreuable .
47013007	And we preien the Lord , that ye do no thing of yuel ; not that we seme preued , but that ye do that that is good , and that we ben as repreuable .
47013008	For we moun no thing ayens treuthe , but for the treuthe .
47013009	For we ioyen , whanne we ben sijk , but ye ben myyti ; and we preien this thing , youre perfeccioun .
47013010	Therfor Y absent write these thingis , that Y present do not hardere , bi the powere , which the Lord yaf to me in to edificacioun , and not in to youre distruccioun .
47013011	Britheren , ` hennus forward ioye ye , be ye perfit , excite ye ; vndurstonde ye the same thing ; haue ye pees , and God of pees and of loue schal be with you .
47013012	Grete ye wel togidere in hooli cos . Alle hooli men greten you wel .
47013013	
47013014	The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , and the charite of God , and the comynyng of the Hooli Gost , be with ` you alle . Amen .
48001001	Poul the apostle , not of men , ne bi man , but bi Jhesu Crist , and God the fadir ,
48001002	that reiside hym fro deth , and alle the britheren that ben with me , to the chirchis of Galathie ,
48001003	grace to you and pees of God the fadir , and of the Lord Jhesu Crist ,
48001004	that yaf hym silf for oure synnes , to delyuere vs fro the present wickid world , bi the wille of God and of oure fadir ,
48001005	to whom is worschip and glorie in to worldis of worldis . Amen .
48001006	I wondur , that so soone ye be thus moued fro hym that clepid you in to the grace of Crist , in to another euangelie ; which is not anothir ,
48001007	but that ther ben summe that troublen you , and wolen mysturne the euangelie of Crist .
48001008	But thouy we , or an aungel of heuene , prechide to you , bisidis that that we han prechid to you , be he acursid .
48001009	As Y haue seid bifore , and now eftsoones Y seie , if ony preche to you bisidis that that ye han vndurfongun , be he cursid .
48001010	For now whether counsele Y men , or God ? or whether Y seche to plese men ? If Y pleside yit men , Y were not Cristis seruaunt .
48001011	For , britheren , Y make knowun to you the euangelie , that was prechid of me , for it is not bi man ;
48001012	ne Y took it of man , ne lernyde , but bi reuelacioun of Jhesu Crist .
48001013	For ye han herd my conuersacioun sumtyme in the Jurie , and that Y pursuede passyngli the chirche of God , and fauyt ayen it .
48001014	And Y profitide in the Jurie aboue many of myn eueneldis in my kynrede , and was more aboundauntli a folewere of my fadris tradiciouns .
48001015	But whanne it pleside hym , that departide me fro my modir wombe ,
48001016	and clepide bi his grace , to schewe his sone in me , that Y schulde preche hym among the hethene , anoon Y drowy me not to fleisch and blood ; ne Y cam to Jerusalem to the apostlis ,
48001017	that weren tofor me , but Y wente in to Arabie , and eftsoones Y turnede ayen in to Damask .
48001018	And sith thre yeer aftir Y cam to Jerusalem , to se Petre , and Y dwellide with hym fiftene daies ;
48001019	but Y sawy noon othere of the apostlis , but James , oure Lordis brother .
48001020	And these thingis which Y write to you , lo ! tofor God Y lie not .
48001021	Afterward Y cam in to the coostis of Syrie and Cilicie .
48001022	But Y was vnknowun bi face to the chirchis of Judee , that weren in Crist ; and thei hadden oonli an heryng ,
48001023	that he that pursuede vs sum tyme , prechide now the feith , ayens which he fauyte sum tyme ;
48001024	and in me thei glorifieden God .
48002001	And sith fourtene yeer aftir , eftsones Y wente vp to Jerusalem with Barnabas , and took with me Tite .
48002002	Y wente vp bi reuelacioun , and spak with hem the euangelie , which Y preche among the hethene ; and bi hem silf to these that semeden to be sumwhat , lest Y runne , or hadde runne in veyne .
48002003	And nother Tite , that hadde be with me , while he was hethene , was compellid to be circumsidid ;
48002004	but for false britheren that weren brouyt ynne , whiche hadden entrid to aspie oure fredom , which we han in Jhesu Crist , to bring vs in to seruage .
48002005	But we yyue no place to subieccioun , that the treuthe of the gospel schulde dwelle with you .
48002006	But of these that semeden to be sumwhat ; whiche thei weren sum tyme , it perteyneth not to me , for God takith not the persoone of man ; for thei that semeden to be sumwhat , yauen me no thing .
48002007	But ayenward , whanne thei hadden seyn , that the euangelie of prepucie was youun to me , as the euangelie of circumcisioun was youun to Petre ;
48002008	for he that wrouyte to Petre in apostlehed of circumcisioun , wrouyte also to me among the hethene ;
48002009	and whanne thei hadden knowe the grace of God , that was youun to me , James , and Petre , and Joon , whiche weren seyn to be the pileris , thei yauen riythond of felowschip to me and to Barnabas , that we among the hethene , and thei in to circumcisioun ;
48002010	oneli that we hadde mynde of pore men ` of Crist , the which thing Y was ful bisi to doon .
48002011	But whanne Petre was comun to Antioche , Y ayenstood hym in the face , for he was worthi to be vndirnommen .
48002012	For bifor that ther camen summen fro James , he eete with the hethene men ; but whanne thei weren comun , he withdrowy , and departide hym , dredinge hem that weren of circumcisioun .
48002013	And the othere Jewis assentiden to his feynyng , so that Barnabas was drawun of hem in to that feynyng .
48002014	But whanne Y sawy , that thei walkiden not riytli to the treuthe of the gospel , Y seide to Petre bifor alle men , If thou , that art a Jew , lyuest hethenlich , and not Jewelich , hou constreynest thou hethene men to bicome Jewis ?
48002015	We Jewis of kynde , and not synful men of the hethene ,
48002016	knowen that a man is not iustified of the werkis of lawe , but bi the feith of Jhesu Crist ; and we bileuen in Jhesu Crist , that we ben iustified of the feith of Crist , and not of the werkis of lawe . Wherfor of the werkis of lawe ech fleisch schal not be iustified .
48002017	And if we sechen to be iustified in Crist , we oure silf ben foundun synful men , whether Crist be mynystre of synne ?
48002018	God forbede . And if Y bylde ayen thingis that Y haue distruyed , Y make my silf a trespassour .
48002019	For bi the lawe Y am deed to the lawe , and Y am fitchid to the crosse , that Y lyue to God with Crist .
48002020	And now lyue not Y , but Crist lyueth in me . But that Y lyue now in fleisch , Y lyue in the feith of Goddis sone , that louede me , and yaf hym silf for me .
48002021	Y caste not awey the grace of God ; for if riytwisnesse be thoruy lawe , thanne Crist diede with out cause .
48003001	Vnwitti Galathies , tofor whos iyen Jhesu Crist is exilid , and is crucified in you , who hath disseyued you , that ye obeyen not to treuthe ?
48003002	This oneli Y wilne to lerne of you , whether ye han vndurfonge the spirit of werkis of the lawe , or of heryng of bileue ?
48003003	So ye ben foolis , that whanne ye han bigunne in spirit , ye ben endid in fleisch .
48003004	So grete thingis ye han suffrid without cause , if it be withoute cause .
48003005	He that yyueth to you spirit , and worchith vertues in you , whether of werkis of the lawe , or of hering of bileue ?
48003006	As it is writun , Abraham bileuede to God , and it was rettid to hym to riytfulnesse .
48003007	And therfor knowe ye , that these that ben of bileue , ben the sones of Abraham .
48003008	And the scripture seynge afer , that God iustifieth the hethene , of bileue told tofor to Abraham , That in thee alle the hethene schulen be blessid .
48003009	And therfor these that ben of bileue , schulen be blessid with feithful Abraham .
48003010	For alle that ben of the werkis of the lawe , ben vndur curse ; for it is writun , Ech man is cursid , that abidith not in alle thingis that ben writun in the book of the lawe , to do tho thingis .
48003011	And that no man is iustified in the lawe bifor God , it is opyn , for a riytful man lyueth of bileue .
48003012	But the lawe is not of bileue , but he that doith tho thingis of the lawe , schal lyue in hem .
48003013	But Crist ayenbouyte us fro the curse of the lawe , and was maad acursid for vs ; for it is writun , Ech man is cursid that hangith in the tre ;
48003014	that among the hethene the blessyng of Abraham were maad in ` Crist Jhesu , that we vndurfonge the biheeste of spirit thoruy bileue .
48003015	Britheren , Y seie aftir man , no man dispisith the testament of a man that is confermed , or ordeyneth aboue .
48003016	The biheestis weren seid to Abraham and to his seed ; he seith not , In seedis , as in many , but as in oon , And to thi seed , that is , Crist .
48003017	But Y seie , this testament is confermed of God ; the lawe that was maad after foure hundrid and thritti yeer , makith not the testament veyn to auoide awei the biheest .
48003018	For if eritage were of the lawe , it were not now of biheeste . But God grauntide to Abraham thoruy biheest .
48003019	What thanne the lawe ? It was sett for trespassing , to the seed come , to whom he hadde maad his biheest . Whiche lawe was ordeyned bi aungels , in the hoond of a mediatour .
48003020	But a mediatour is not of oon . But God is oon .
48003021	Is thanne the lawe ayens the biheestis of God ? God forbede . For if the lawe were youun , that myyte quikene , verili were riytfulnesse of lawe .
48003022	But scripture hath concludid alle thingis vndir synne , that the biheeste of the feith of Jhesu Crist were yyuen to hem that bileuen .
48003023	And tofor that bileue cam , thei weren kept vndur the lawe , enclosid in to that bileue that was to be schewid .
48003024	And so the lawe was oure vndirsmaister in Crist , that we ben iustified of bileue .
48003025	But aftir that bileue cam , we ben not now vndur the vndurmaistir .
48003026	For alle ye ben the children of God thoruy the bileue of Jhesu Crist .
48003027	For alle ye that ben baptisid , ben clothid with Crist .
48003028	Ther is no Jewe , ne Greke , ne bond man , ne fre man , ne male , ne female ; for alle ye ben oon in ` Jhesu Crist .
48003029	And if ye ben oon in ` Jhesu Crist , thanne ye ben the seed of Abraham , and eiris bi biheest .
48004001	But Y seie , as long tyme as the eir is a litil child , he dyuersith no thing fro a seruaunt , whanne he is lord of alle thingis ;
48004002	but he is vndur keperis and tutoris , in to the tyme determyned of the fadir .
48004003	So we , whanne we weren litle children , we serueden vndur the elementis of the world .
48004004	But aftir that the fulfilling of tyme cam , God sente his sone ,
48004005	maad of a womman , maad vndur the lawe , that he schulde ayenbie hem that weren vndur the lawe , that we schulden vnderfonge the adopcioun of sones .
48004006	And for ye ben Goddis sones , God sente his spirit in to youre hertis , criynge , Abba , fadir .
48004007	And so ther is not now a seruaunt , but a sone ; and if he is a sone , he is an eir bi God .
48004008	But thanne ye vnknowynge God , serueden to hem that in kynde weren not goddis .
48004009	But now whanne ye han knowe God , and ben knowun of God , hou ben ye turned eftsoone to the febil and nedi elementis , to the whiche ye wolen eft serue ?
48004010	Ye taken kepe to daies , and monethis , and tymes , and yeris .
48004011	But Y drede you , lest without cause Y haue trauelid among you .
48004012	Be ye as Y , for Y am as ye . Britheren , Y biseche you , ye han hurt me no thing .
48004013	But ye knowen , that bi infirmyte of fleisch Y haue prechid to you now bifore ;
48004014	and ye dispiseden not , nether forsoken youre temptacioun in my fleisch , but ye resseyueden me as an aungel of God , as ` Crist Jhesu .
48004015	Where thanne is youre blessyng ? For Y bere you witnesse , that if it myyte haue be don . ye wolden haue put out youre iyen , and haue yyuen hem to me .
48004016	Am Y thanne maad an enemye to you , seiynge to you the sothe ?
48004017	Thei louen not you wel , but thei wolen exclude you , that ye suen hem .
48004018	But sue ye the good euermore in good , and not oneli whanne Y am present with you .
48004019	My smale children , whiche Y bere eftsoones , til that Crist be fourmed in you ,
48004020	and Y wolde now be at you , and chaunge my vois , for Y am confoundid among you .
48004021	Seie to me , ye that wolen be vndir the lawe , ` han ye not red the lawe ?
48004022	For it is writun , that Abraham hadde two sones , oon of a seruaunt , and oon of a fre womman .
48004023	But he that was of the seruaunt , was borun after the flesh ; but he that was of the fre womman , by a biheeste .
48004024	The whiche thingis ben seid bi an othir vndirstonding . For these ben two testamentis ; oon in the hille of Synai , gendringe in to seruage , which is Agar .
48004025	For Syna is an hille that is in Arabie , which hille is ioyned to it that is now Jerusalem , and seruith with hir children .
48004026	But that Jerusalem that is aboue , is fre , whiche is oure modir .
48004027	For it is writun , Be glad , thou bareyn , that berist not ; breke out and crye , that bringist forth no children ; for many sones ben of hir that is left of hir hosebonde , more than of hir that hath an hosebonde .
48004028	For , britheren , we ben sones of biheeste aftir Isaac ;
48004029	but now as this that was borun after the fleisch pursuede him that was aftir the spirit , so now .
48004030	But what seith the scripture ? Caste out the seruaunt and hir sone , for the sone of the seruaunt schal not be eir with the sone of the fre wijf .
48004031	And so , britheren , we ben not sones of the seruaunt , but of the fre wijf , bi which fredom Crist hath maad vs fre .
48005001	Stonde ye therfor , and nyl ye eftsoones be holdun in the yok of seruage .
48005002	Lo ! Y Poul seie to you , that if ye ben circumcidid , Crist schal no thing profite to you .
48005003	And Y witnesse eftsoones to ech man that circumcidith hym silf , that he is dettour of al the lawe to be don .
48005004	And ye ben voidid awei fro Crist , and ye that be iustified in the lawe , ye han fallen awei fro grace .
48005005	For we thoruy the spirit of bileue abiden the hope of riytfulnesse .
48005006	For in Jhesu Crist nether circumcisioun is ony thing worth , nether prepucie , but the bileue that worchith bi charite .
48005007	Ye runnen wel ; who lettide you that ye obeyede not to treuthe ?
48005008	Consente ye to no man ; for this counsel ys not of hym that hath clepid you .
48005009	A litil souredowy apeirith al the gobet .
48005010	I trust on you in oure Lord , that ye schulden vndurstonde noon other thing . And who that disturblith you , schal bere dom , who euere he be .
48005011	And , britheren , if Y preche yit circumcisioun , what suffre Y yit persecucioun ? thanne the sclaundre of the crosse is auoidid .
48005012	Y wolde that thei weren cut awei , that disturblen you .
48005013	For , britheren , ye ben clepid in to fredom ; oneli yyue ye not fredom in to occasioun of fleisch , but bi charite of spirit serue ye togidere .
48005014	For euery lawe is fulfillid in o word , Thou schalt loue thi neiybore as thi silf .
48005015	And if ye bite , and ete ech othere , se ye , lest ye be wastid ech fro othere .
48005016	And Y seie you in Crist , walke ye in spirit , and ye schulen not performe the desiris of the fleisch .
48005017	For the fleisch coueitith ayens the spirit , and the spirit ayen the fleisch ; for these ben aduersaries togidere , that ye don not alle thingis that ye wolen .
48005018	That if ye be led bi spirit , ye ben not vnder the lawe .
48005019	And werkis of the fleisch ben opyn , whiche ben fornicacioun , vnclennes , vnchastite , letcherie , seruice of false goddis ,
48005020	witchecraftis , enmytees , striuyngis , indignaciouns , wraththis , chidingis , discenciouns , sectis , enuyes ,
48005021	manslauytris , dronkennessis , vnmesurable etyngis , and thingis lijk to these , whiche Y seie to you , as Y haue told to you ` to fore , for thei that doon suche thingis , schulen not haue the kyngdom of God .
48005022	But the fruyt of the spirit is charite , ioye , pees , pacience , long abidyng ,
48005023	benygnyte , goodnesse , myldenesse , feith , temperaunce , contynence , chastite ; ayen suche thingis is no lawe .
48005024	And they that ben of Crist , han crucified her fleisch with vices and coueytyngis .
48005025	If we lyuen bi spirit , walke we bi spirit ;
48005026	be we not made coueytouse of veyn glorie , stirynge ech othere to wraththe , or hauynge enuye ech to othere .
48006001	Britheren , if a man be occupied in ony gilt , ye that ben spiritual , enforme ye such oon in spirit of softnesse , biholdinge thi silf , lest that thou be temptid .
48006002	Ech bere othere chargis , and so ye schulen fulfille the lawe of Crist .
48006003	For who that trowith that he be ouyt , whanne he is nouyt , he bigilith him silf .
48006004	But ech man preue his owne werk , and so he schal haue glorie in him silf , and not in an othere .
48006005	For ech man schal bere his owne charge .
48006006	He that is tauyt bi word , comune he with him that techith hym , in ` alle goodis .
48006007	Nyle ye erre , God is not scorned ;
48006008	for tho thingis that a man sowith , tho thingis he schal repe . For he that sowith in his fleisch , of the fleisch he schal repe corrupcioun ; but he that sowith in the spirit , of the spirit he schal repe euerelastynge lijf .
48006009	And doynge good faile we not ; for in his tyme we schal repe , not failinge .
48006010	Therfor while we han tyme , worche we good to alle men ; but most to hem that ben homliche of the feith .
48006011	Se ye , what maner lettris Y haue write to you with myn owne hoond .
48006012	For who euere wole plese in the fleisch , ` this constreyneth you to be circumcidid , oonli that thei suffren not the persecucioun of Cristis crosse .
48006013	For nether thei that ben circumcidid kepen the lawe ; but thei wolen that ye be circumcidid , that thei haue glorie in youre fleisch .
48006014	But fer be it fro me to haue glorie , no but in the crosse of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , bi whom the world is crucified to me , and Y to the world .
48006015	For in Jhesu Crist nether circumcisioun is ony thing worth , ne prepucie , but a newe creature .
48006016	And who euere suwen this reule , pees on hem , and merci , and on Israel of God .
48006017	And heraftir no man be heuy to me ; for Y bere in my bodi the tokenes of oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
48006018	The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with youre spirit , britheren . Amen .
49001001	Poul , the apostle of Jhesu Crist , bi the wille of God , to alle seyntis that ben at Effesie , and to the feithful men in Jhesu Crist ,
49001002	grace be to you and pees of God , oure fader , and oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
49001003	Blessid be God and the fadir of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , that hath blessid vs in al spiritual blessing in heuenli thingis in Crist ,
49001004	as he hath chosun vs in hym silf bifor the makyng of the world , that we weren hooli , and with out wem in his siyt , in charite .
49001005	Which hath bifor ordeyned vs in to adopcioun of sones bi Jhesu Crist in to hym , bi the purpos of his wille ,
49001006	in to the heriyng of the glorie of his grace ;
49001007	in which he hath glorified vs in his dereworthe sone . In whom we han redempcioun bi his blood , foryyuenesse of synnes , aftir the ritchessis of his grace ,
49001008	that aboundide greetli in vs in al wisdom and prudence ,
49001009	to make knowun to vs the sacrament of his wille , bi the good plesaunce of hym ; the which sacrament he purposide in
49001010	hym in the dispensacioun of plente of tymes to enstore alle thingis in Crist , whiche ben in heuenes , and whiche ben in erthe , in hym .
49001011	In whom we ben clepid bi sort , bifor ordeyned bi the purpos of hym that worchith alle thingis bi the counsel of his wille ;
49001012	that we be in to the heriyng of his glorie , we that han hopid bifor in Crist .
49001013	In whom also ye weren clepid , whanne ye herden the word of treuthe , the gospel of youre heelthe , in whom ye bileuynge ben merkid with the Hooli Goost of biheest , which is the ernes of oure eritage ,
49001014	in to the redempcioun of purchasyng , in to heriyng of his glorie .
49001015	Therfor and Y herynge youre feith , that is in Crist Jhesu , and the loue in to alle seyntis ,
49001016	ceesse not to do thankyngis for you , makynge mynde of you in my preieris ;
49001017	that God of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , the fadir of glorie , yyue to you the spirit of wisdom and of reuelacioun , in to the knowyng of hym ;
49001018	and the iyen of youre herte liytned , that ye wite , which is the hope of his clepyng , and whiche ben the richessis of the glorie of his eritage in seyntis ;
49001019	and whych is the excellent greetnesse of his vertu in to vs that han bileuyd , bi the worchyng of the myyt of his vertu ,
49001020	which he wrouyte in Crist , reisynge hym fro deth , and settynge him on his riyt half in heuenli thingis ,
49001021	aboue ech principat , and potestat , and vertu , and domynacioun , and aboue ech name that is named , not oneli in this world , but also in the world to comynge ;
49001022	and made alle thingis suget vndur hise feet , and yaf hym to be heed ouer al the chirche ,
49001023	that is the bodi of hym , and the plente of hym , which is alle thingis in alle thingis fulfillid .
49002001	And whanne ye weren deed in youre giltis and synnes ,
49002002	in which ye wandriden sum tyme aftir the cours of this world , aftir the prince of the power of this eir , of the spirit that worchith now in to the sones of vnbileue ;
49002003	in which also we ` alle lyueden sum tyme in the desiris of oure fleisch , doynge the willis of the fleisch and of thouytis , and we weren bi kynde the sones of wraththe , as othere men ;
49002004	but God , that is riche in merci , for his ful myche charite in which he louyde vs ,
49002005	yhe , whanne we weren deed in synnes , quikenede vs togidere in Crist , bi whos grace ye ben sauyd , and ayen reiside togidere ,
49002006	and made togidere to sitte in heuenli thingis in Crist Jhesu ;
49002007	that he schulde schewe in the worldis aboue comynge the plenteuouse ritchessis of his grace in goodnesse on vs in Crist Jhesu .
49002008	For bi grace ye ben sauyd bi feith , and this not of you ; for it is the yifte of God ,
49002009	not of werkis , that no man haue glorie .
49002010	For we ben the makyng of hym , maad of nouyt in Crist Jhesu , in good werkis , whiche God hath ordeyned , that we go in tho werkis .
49002011	For which thing be ye myndeful , that sumtyme ye weren hethene in fleisch , which weren seid prepucie , fro that that is seid circumcisioun maad bi hond in fleisch ;
49002012	and ye weren in that time with out Crist , alienyd fro the lyuyng of Israel , and gestis of testamentis , not hauynge hope of biheest , and with outen God in this world .
49002013	But now in Crist Jhesu ye that weren sum tyme fer , ben maad nyy in the blood of Crist .
49002014	For he is oure pees , that made bothe oon , and vnbyndynge the myddil wal of a wal with out morter , enmytees in his fleisch ;
49002015	and auoidide the lawe of maundementis bi domes , that he make twei in hym silf in to a newe man ,
49002016	makynge pees , to recounsele bothe in o bodi to God bi the cros , sleynge the enemytees in hym silf .
49002017	And he comynge prechide pees to you that weren fer , and pees to hem that weren niy ;
49002018	for bi hym we bothe han niy comyng in o spirit to the fadir .
49002019	Therfor now ye ben not gestis and straungeris , but ye ben citeseyns of seyntis , and houshold meine of God ;
49002020	aboue bildid on the foundement of apostlis and of profetis , vpon that hiyeste corner stoon , Crist Jhesu ;
49002021	in whom ech bildyng maad waxith in to an hooli temple in the Lord .
49002022	In whom also ` be ye bildid togidere in to the habitacle of God , in the Hooli Goost .
49003001	For the grace of this thing I Poul , the boundun of Crist Jhesu , for you hethene men ,
49003002	if netheles ye han herd the dispensacioun of Goddis grace , that is youun to me in you .
49003003	For bi reuelacioun the sacrament is maad knowun to me , as Y aboue wroot in schort thing ,
49003004	as ye moun rede , and vndurstonde my prudence in the mysterie of Crist .
49003005	Which was not knowun to othere generaciouns to the sones of men , as it is now schewid to his hooli apostlis and prophetis in the spirit ,
49003006	that hethene men ben euen eiris , and of oo bodi , and parteneris togidere of his biheest in Crist Jhesu bi the euangelie ;
49003007	whos mynystre Y am maad , bi the yifte of Goddis grace , which is youun to me bi the worchyng of his vertu .
49003008	To me , leeste of alle seyntis , this grace is youun to preche among hethene men the vnserchable richessis of Crist , and to liytne alle men ,
49003009	which is the dispensacioun of sacrament hid fro worldis in God , that made alle thingis of nouyt ;
49003010	that the myche fold wisdom of God be knowun to princis and potestatis in heuenli thingis bi the chirche ,
49003011	bi the bifore ordinaunce of worldis , which he made in Crist Jhesu oure Lord .
49003012	In whom we han trist and nyy comyng , in tristenyng bi the feith of hym .
49003013	For which thing Y axe , that ye faile not in my tribulaciouns for you , which is youre glorie .
49003014	For grace of this thing Y bowe my knees to the fadir of oure Lord Jhesu Crist ,
49003015	of whom ech fadirhod in heuenes and in erthe is named ,
49003016	that he yyue to you , aftir the richessis of his glorie , vertu to be strengthid bi his spirit in the ynnere man ,
49003017	that Crist dwelle bi feith in youre hertis ; that ye rootid and groundid in charite ,
49003018	moun comprehende with alle seyntis , which is the breede , and the lengthe , and the hiynesse , and the depnesse ;
49003019	also to wite the charite of Crist more excellent than science , that ye be fillid in al the plentee of God .
49003020	And to hym that is myyti to do alle thingis more plenteuousli than we axen or vndurstondun , bi the vertu that worchith in vs ,
49003021	to hym be glorie in the chirche , and in Crist Jhesu , in to alle the generaciouns of the world of worldis . Amen .
49004001	Therfor Y boundun for the Lord biseche you , that ye walke worthili in the clepyng ,
49004002	in which ye ben clepid , with al mekenesse and myldenesse , with pacience supportinge ech other in charite ,
49004003	bisi to kepe vnyte of spirit in the boond of pees .
49004004	O bodi and o spirit , as ye ben clepid in oon hope of youre cleping ;
49004005	o Lord ,
49004006	o feith , o baptym , o God and fadir of alle , which is aboue alle men , and bi alle thingis , and in vs alle .
49004007	But to ech of vs grace is youun bi the mesure of the yyuyng of Crist ;
49004008	for which thing he seith , He stiynge an hiy , ledde caitifte caitif , he yaf yiftis to men .
49004009	But what is it , that he stiede vp , no but that also he cam doun first in to the lowere partis of the erthe ?
49004010	He it is that cam doun , and that stiede on alle heuenes , that he schulde fille alle thingis .
49004011	And he yaf summe apostlis , summe prophetis , othere euangelistis , othere scheepherdis and techeris ,
49004012	to the ful endyng of seyntis , in to the werk of mynystrie , in to edificacioun of Cristis bodi ,
49004013	til we rennen alle , in to vnyte of feith and of knowyng of Goddis sone , in to a parfit man , aftir the mesure of age of the plente of Crist ;
49004014	that we be not now litle children , mouynge as wawis , and be not borun aboute with ech wynd of teching , in the weiwardnesse of men , in sutil wit , to the disseyuyng of errour .
49004015	But do we treuthe in charite , and wexe in him by alle thingis , that is Crist oure heed ;
49004016	of whom alle the bodi set togidere , and boundun togidere bi ech ioynture of vnder seruyng , bi worching in to the mesure of ech membre , makith encreesyng of the bodi , in to edificacioun of it silf in charite .
49004017	Therfor Y seie and witnesse this thing in the Lord , that ye walke not now , as hethene men walken , in the vanyte of her wit ;
49004018	that han vndurstondyng derkned with derknessis , and ben alienyd fro the lijf of God , bi ignoraunce that is in hem , for the blyndenesse of her herte .
49004019	Which dispeirynge bitoken hem silf to vnchastite , in to the worchyng of al vnclennesse in coueitise .
49004020	But ye han not so lerud Crist , if netheles ye herden hym ,
49004021	and ben tauyt in hym , as is treuthe in Jhesu .
49004022	Do ye awey bi the elde lyuyng the elde man , that is corrupt bi the desiris of errour ;
49004023	and be ye renewlid in the spirit of youre soule ;
49004024	and clothe ye the newe man , which is maad aftir God in riytwisnesse and hoolynesse of treuthe .
49004025	For which thing ` ye putte awei leesyng , and speke ye treuthe ech man with his neiybore , for we ben membris ech to othere .
49004026	Be ye wrooth , and nyle ye do synne ; the sunne falle not doun on youre wraththe .
49004027	Nyle ye yyue stide to the deuel .
49004028	He that stal , now stele he not ; but more trauele he in worchinge with hise hondis that that is good , that he haue whereof he schal yyue to nedi .
49004029	Ech yuel word go not of youre mouth ; but if ony is good to the edificacioun of feith , that it yyue grace to men that heren .
49004030	And nyle ye make the Hooli Goost of God sori , in which ye ben markid in the dai of redempcioun .
49004031	Al bitternesse , and wraththe , and indignacioun , and cry , and blasfemye be takun awey fro you , with al malice ;
49004032	and be ye togidere benygne , merciful , foryyuynge togidere , as also God foryaf to you in Crist .
49005001	Therfor be ye foloweris of God , as moost dereworthe sones ;
49005002	and walke ye in loue , as Crist louyde vs , and yaf hym silf for vs an offryng and a sacrifice to God , in to the odour of swetnesse .
49005003	And fornycacioun , and al vnclennesse , or aueryce , be not named among you , as it bicometh holi men ;
49005004	ethir filthe , or foli speche , or harlatrye , that perteyneth not to profit , but more doyng of thankyngis .
49005005	For wite ye this , and vndurstonde , that ech letchour , or vnclene man , or coueytouse , that serueth to mawmetis , hath not eritage in the kingdom of Crist and of God .
49005006	No man disseyue you bi veyn wordis ; for whi for these thingis the wraththe of God cam on the sones of vnbileue .
49005007	Therfor nyle ye be maad parteneris of hem .
49005008	For ye weren sum tyme derknessis , but now ` ye ben liyt in the Lord . Walke ye as the sones of liyt .
49005009	For the fruyt of liyt is in al goodnesse , and riytwisnesse , and treuthe .
49005010	And preue ye what ` thing is wel plesynge to God .
49005011	And nyle ye comyne to vnfruytouse werkis of derknessis ; but more repreue ye .
49005012	For what thingis ben don of hem in priuy , it is foule , yhe , to speke .
49005013	And alle thingis that ben repreuyd of the liyt , ben opynli schewid ; for al thing that is schewid , is liyt .
49005014	For which thing he seith , Rise thou that slepist , and rise vp fro deth , and Crist schal liytne thee .
49005015	Therfor , britheren , se ye , hou warli ye schulen go ;
49005016	not as vnwise men , but as wise men , ayenbiynge tyme , for the daies ben yuele .
49005017	Therfor nyle ye be maad vnwise , but vndurstondynge which is the wille of God .
49005018	And nyle ye be drunkun of wyn , in which is letcherie , but be ye fillid with the Hooli Goost ; and speke ye to you silf in salmes ,
49005019	and ymnes , and spiritual songis , syngynge and seiynge salm in youre hertis to the Lord ;
49005020	euermore doynge thankingis for alle thingis in the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist to God and to the fadir .
49005021	Be ye suget togidere in the drede of Crist .
49005022	Wymmen , be thei suget to her hosebondis ,
49005023	as to the Lord , for the man is heed of the wymman , as Crist is heed of the chirche ; he is sauyour of his bodi .
49005024	But as the chirche is suget to Crist , so wymmen to her hosebondis in alle thingis .
49005025	Men , loue ye youre wyues , as Crist louyde the chirche , and yaf hym silf for it , to make it holi ;
49005026	and clenside it with the waisching of watir , in the word of lijf ,
49005027	to yyue the chirche gloriouse to hym silf , that it hadde no wem , ne ryueling , or ony siche thing , but that it be hooli and vndefoulid .
49005028	So and men ` schulen loue her wyues , as her owne bodies . He that loueth his wijf , loueth hym silf ;
49005029	for no man hatide euere his owne fleisch , but nurischith and fostrith it , as Crist doith the chirche .
49005030	And we ben membris of his bodi , of his fleisch , and of his boonys .
49005031	For this thing a man schal forsake his fadir and modir , and he schal drawe to his wijf ; and thei schulen be tweyne in o fleisch .
49005032	This sacrament is greet ; yhe , Y seie in Crist , and in the chirche .
49005033	Netheles ye alle , ech man loue his wijf as hym silf ; and the wijf drede hir hosebonde .
49006001	Sones , obeische ye to youre fadir and modir , in the Lord ; for this thing is riytful .
49006002	Onoure thou thi fadir and thi modir , that is the firste maundement in biheest ;
49006003	that it be wel to thee , and that thou be long lyuynge on the erthe .
49006004	And , fadris , nyle ye terre youre sones to wraththe ; but nurische ye hem in the teching and chastising of the Lord .
49006005	Seruauntis , obeische ye to fleischli lordis with drede and trembling , in simplenesse of youre herte , as to Crist ;
49006006	not seruynge at the iye , as plesinge to men , but as seruauntis of Crist ; doynge the wille of God bi discrecioun ,
49006007	with good wille seruynge as to the Lord , and not as to men ;
49006008	witinge that ech man , what euere good thing he schal do , he schal resseyue this of the Lord , whether seruaunt , whether fre man .
49006009	And , ye lordis , do the same thingis to hem , foryyuynge manaasis ; witinge that bothe her Lord and youre is in heuenes , and the taking of persones is not anentis God .
49006010	Her aftirward , britheren , be ye coumfortid in the Lord , and in the miyt of his vertu .
49006011	Clothe you with the armere of God , that ye moun stonde ayens aspiynges of the deuel .
49006012	For whi stryuyng is not to vs ayens fleisch and blood , but ayens princis and potestatis , ayens gouernours of the world of these derknessis , ayens spiritual thingis of wickidnesse , in heuenli thingis .
49006013	Therfor take ye the armere of God , that ye moun ayenstonde in the yuel dai ; and in alle thingis stonde perfit .
49006014	Therfor stonde ye , and be gird aboute youre leendis in sothefastnesse , and clothid with the haburioun of riytwisnesse ,
49006015	and youre feet schood in making redi of the gospel of pees .
49006016	In alle thingis take ye the scheld of feith , in which ye moun quenche alle the firy dartis of ` the worste .
49006017	And take ye the helm of helthe , and the swerd of the Goost , that is , the word of God .
49006018	Bi al preier and bisechyng preie ye al tyme in spirit , and in hym wakinge in al bisynesse , and bisechyng for alle hooli men , and for me ;

49006020	for which Y am set in message in a chayne ; so that in it Y be hardi to speke , as it bihoueth me .
49006021	And ye wite , what thingis ben aboute me , what Y do , Titicus , my moost dere brother , and trewe mynystre in the Lord , schal make alle thingis knowun to you ;
49006022	whom Y sente to you for this same thing , that ye knowe what thingis ben aboute vs , and that he coumforte youre hertis .
49006023	Pees to britheren , and charite , with feith of God oure fadir , and of the Lord Jhesu Crist .
49006024	Grace with alle men that louen oure Lord Jhesu Crist in vncorrupcioun . Amen , ` that is , So be it .
50001001	Poul and Tymothe , seruauntis of Jhesu Crist , to alle the hooli men in Crist Jhesu , that ben at Filippis , with bischopis and dekenes ,
50001002	grace and pees to you of God oure fadir , and of the Lord Jhesu Crist .
50001003	I do thankyngis to my God
50001004	in al mynde of you euere more in alle my preyeris for alle you with ioye , and
50001005	make a bisechyng on youre comynyng in the gospel of Crist , fro the firste day til nowe ;
50001006	tristenynge this ilke thing , that he that bigan in you a good werk , schal perfourme it til in to the dai of Jhesu Crist .
50001007	As it is iust to me to feele this thing for alle you , for that Y haue you in herte , and in my boondis , and in defending and confermyng of the gospel , that alle ye be felowis of my ioye .
50001008	For God is a witnesse to me , hou Y coueyte alle you in the bowelis of Jhesu Crist .
50001009	And this thing Y preie , that youre charite be plenteuouse more and more in kunnyng , and in al wit ;
50001010	that ye preue the betere thingis , that ye be clene and without offence in the dai of Crist ;
50001011	fillid with the fruyt of riytwysnesse bi Jhesu Crist , in to the glory and the heriyng of God .
50001012	For , britheren , Y wole that ye wite , that the thingis that ben aboute me han comun more to the profit of the gospel ,
50001013	so that my boondis weren maad knowun in Crist , in ech moot halle , and in alle other placis ;
50001014	that mo of britheren tristinge in the Lord more plenteuously for my boondis , dursten without drede speke the word of God .
50001015	But summe for enuye and strijf , summe for good wille , prechen Crist ;
50001016	and summe of charite , witinge that Y am put in the defense of the gospel .
50001017	But summe of strijf schewen Crist not cleneli , gessynge hem to reise tribulacioun to my boondis .
50001018	But what ? the while on al maner , ethir bi occasioun , ethir bi treuthe , Crist is schewid ; and in this thing Y haue ioye , but also Y schal haue ioye .
50001019	And Y woot , that this thing schal come to me in to heelthe bi youre preyer , and the vndurmynystring of the spirit of ` Jhesu Crist , bi myn abidyng and hope .
50001020	For in no thing Y schal be schamed , but in al trist as euere more and now , Crist schal be magnefied in my bodi , ether bi lijf , ether bi deth .
50001021	For me to lyue is Crist , and to die is wynnyng .
50001022	That if to lyue in fleisch , is fruyt of werk to me , lo ! what Y schal chese , Y knowe not .
50001023	But Y am constreyned of twei thingis , Y haue desire to be dissolued , and to be with Crist , it is myche more betere ; but to dwelle in fleisch ,
50001024	is nedeful for you .
50001025	And Y tristinge this thing , woot that Y schal dwelle , and perfitli dwelle to alle you , to youre profit and ioye of feith ,
50001026	that youre thanking abounde in Crist Jhesu in me , bi my comyng eftsoone to you .
50001027	Oneli lyue ye worthili to the gospel of Crist , that whether whanne Y come and se you , ethir absent Y here of you , that ye stonden in o spirit of o wille , trauelinge togidere to the feith of the gospel .
50001028	And in no thing be ye aferd of aduersaries , which is to hem cause of perdicioun ,
50001029	but to you cause of heelthe . And this thing is of God . For it is youun to you for Crist , that not oneli ye bileuen in hym , but also that ye suffren for hym ;
50001030	hauynge the same strijf , which ye saien in me , and now ye han herd of me .
50002001	Therfor if ony coumfort is in Crist , if ony solace of charite , if ony felouschipe of spirit , if ony inwardnesse of merci doyng ,
50002002	fille ye my ioye , that ye vndurstonde the same thing , and haue the same charite , of o wille , and feelen the same thing ;
50002003	no thing bi strijf , nether by veyn glorie , but in mekenesse , demynge eche othere to be heiyer than hym silf ;
50002004	not biholdinge ech bi hym silf what thingis ben his owne , but tho thingis that ben of othere men .
50002005	And fele ye this thing in you , which also in Crist Jhesu ;
50002006	that whanne he was in the forme of God , demyde not raueyn , that hym silf were euene to God ;
50002007	but he lowide hym silf , takinge the forme of a seruaunt , and was maad in to the licknesse of men , and in abite was foundun as a man .
50002008	He mekide hym silf , and was maad obedient to the deth , yhe , to the deth of the cross .
50002009	For which thing God enhaunside hym , and yaf to hym a name that is aboue al name ;
50002010	that in the name of Jhesu ech kne be bowid , of heuenli thingis , of ertheli thingis , and of hellis ;
50002011	and ech tunge knouleche , that the Lord Jhesu Crist is in the glorie of God the fadir .
50002012	Therfor , my most dereworthe britheren , as euere more ye han obeischid , not in my presence onely , but myche more now in myn absence , worche ye with drede and trembling youre heelthe .
50002013	For it is God that worchith in you , bothe to wilne , and to performe , for good wille .
50002014	And do ye alle thingis with out grutchingis and doutyngis ;
50002015	that ye be with out playnt , and symple as the sones of God , with out repreef , in the myddil of a schrewid nacioun and a weiward ; among whiche ye schynen as yyueris of liyt in the world .
50002016	And holde ye togidere the word of lijf to my glorie in the day of Crist ; for Y haue not runnen in veyn , nether Y haue trauelid in veyn .
50002017	But thouy Y be offrid or slayn on the sacrifice and seruyce of youre feith , Y haue ioye , and Y thanke you alle .
50002018	And the same thing haue ye ioye , and thanke ye me .
50002019	And Y hope in the Lord Jhesu , that Y schal sende Tymothe soone to you , that Y be of good coumfort , whanne tho thingis ben knowun that ben aboute you .
50002020	For Y haue no man so of o wille , that is bisi for you with clene affeccioun .
50002021	For alle men seken tho thingis that ben her owne , not tho that ben of Crist Jhesu .
50002022	But knowe ye the asaie of hym , for as a sone to the fadir he hath seruyd with me in the gospel .
50002023	Therfor Y hope that Y schal sende hym to you , anoon as Y se what thingis ben aboute me .
50002024	And Y triste in the Lord , that also my silf schal come to you soone .
50002025	And Y gesside it nedeful to sende to you Epafrodite , my brother and euene worchere , and myn euene knyyt , but youre apostle , and the mynystre of my nede .
50002026	For he desiride you alle , and he was sorewful , therfor that ye herden that he was sijk .
50002027	For he was sijk to the deth , but God hadde merci on him ; and not oneli on hym , but also on me , lest Y hadde heuynesse on heuynesse .
50002028	Therfor more hastili Y sente hym , that whanne ye han seyn hym , ye haue ioye eft , and Y be withouten heuynesse .
50002029	Therfor resseyue ye hym with al ioye in the Lord , and haue ye suche with al onour .
50002030	For the werk of Crist he wente to deth , yyuynge his lijf , that he schulde fulfille that that failide of you anentis my seruyce .
50003001	Hennus forward , my britheren , haue ye ioye in the Lord . To write to you the same thingis , to me it is not slow , and to you it is necessarie .
50003002	Se ye houndis , se ye yuele werk men , se ye dyuysioun .
50003003	For we ben circumcisioun , which bi spirit seruen to God , and glorien in Crist Jhesu , and han not trist in the fleisch ,
50003004	thouy Y haue trust , yhe , in the fleisch . If ony othere man is seyn to triste in the fleisch ,
50003005	Y more , that was circumcidid in the eiytthe dai , of the kyn of Israel , of the lynage of Beniamyn , an Ebrew of Ebrewis , bi the lawe a Farisee ,
50003006	bi loue pursuynge the chirche of God , bi riytwisnesse that is in the lawe lyuynge with out playnt .
50003007	But whiche thingis weren to me wynnyngis , Y haue demed these apeyryngis for Crist .
50003008	Netheles Y gesse alle thingis to be peirement for the cleer science of Jhesu Crist my Lord . For whom Y made alle thingis peyrement , and Y deme as drit ,
50003009	that Y wynne Crist , and that Y be foundun in hym , not hauynge my riytwisnesse that is of the lawe , but that that is of the feith of Crist Jhesu , that is of God the riytwisnesse in feith ,
50003010	to knowe hym , and the vertu of his risyng ayen , and the felouschipe of his passioun , and be maad lijk to his deeth ,
50003011	if on ony maner Y come to the resurreccioun that is fro deth .
50003012	Not that now Y haue takun , or now am parfit ; but Y sue , if in ony maner Y comprehende , in which thing also Y am comprehendid of Crist Jhesu .
50003013	Bretheren , Y deme me not that Y haue comprehendid ; but o thing , Y foryete tho thingis that ben bihyndis , and stretche forth my silf to tho thingis that ben bifore ,
50003014	and pursue to the ordeyned mede of the hiy clepyng of God in Crist Jhesu .
50003015	Therfor who euere we ben perfit , feele we this thing . And if ye vndurstonden in othere manere ony thing , this thing God schal schewe to you .
50003016	Netheles to what thing we han comun , that we vndurstonden the same thing , and that we perfitli dwelle in the same reule .
50003017	Britheren , be ye my foleweris , and weyte ye hem that walken so , as ye han oure fourme .
50003018	For many walken , whiche Y haue seid ofte to you , but now Y wepinge seie , the enemyes of Cristis cros ,
50003019	who ende is deth , whos god is the wombe , and the glorie in confusioun of hem , that saueren ertheli thingis .
50003020	But oure lyuyng is in heuenes ; fro whennus also we abiden the sauyour oure Lord Jhesu Crist ,
50003021	which schal reforme the bodi of oure mekenesse , that is maad lijk to the bodi of his clerenesse , bi the worching bi which he mai ` also make alle thingis suget to hym .
50004001	Therfor , my britheren most dereworthe and most desirid , my ioye and my coroun , so stonde ye in the Lord , most dere britheren .
50004002	Y preye Eucodiam , and biseche Synticem , to vndurstonde the same thing in the Lord .
50004003	Also Y preye and thee , german felow , helpe thou the ilke wymmen that traueliden with me in the gospel , with Clement and othere myn helperis , whos names ben in the book of lijf .
50004004	Ioye ye in the Lord euere more ; eft Y seie , ioye ye .
50004005	Be youre pacyence knowun to alle men ; the Lord is niy .
50004006	Be ye nothing bisi , but in al preyer and biseching , with doyng of thankyngis , be youre axyngis knowun at God .
50004007	And the pees of God , that passith al wit , kepe youre hertis and vndurstondingis in Crist Jhesu .
50004008	Fro hennus forth , britheren , what euere thingis ben sothe , what euere thingis chast , what euere thingis iust , what euere thingis hooli , what euere thingis able to be louyd , what euere thingis of good fame , if ony vertu , if ony preising of discipline , thenke ye these thingis ,
50004009	that also ye han lerud , and take , and heed , and seyn in me . Do ye these thingis , and God of pees schal be with you .
50004010	But Y ioyede greetli in the Lord , that sum tyme aftirward ye floureden ayen to feele for me , as also ye feeliden . But ye weren ocupied , Y seie not as for nede ,
50004011	for Y haue lerud to be sufficient in whiche thingis Y am .
50004012	And Y can also be lowid , Y can also haue plentee . Euery where and in alle thingis Y am tauyt to be fillid , and to hungur , and to abounde , and to suffre myseiste .
50004013	Y may alle thingis in hym that coumfortith me .
50004014	Netheles ye han doon wel , comynynge to my tribulacioun .
50004015	For and ye , Filipensis , witen , that in the bigynnyng of the gospel , whanne Y wente forth fro Macedonye , no chirche comynede with me in resoun of thing youun and takun , but ye aloone .
50004016	Whiche senten to Tessalonyk onys and twies also in to vss to me .
50004017	Not for Y seke yifte , but Y requyre fruyt aboundinge in youre resoun .
50004018	For Y haue alle thingis , and abounde ; Y am fillid with tho thingis takun of Epafrodite , whiche ye senten in to the odour of swetnesse , a couenable sacrifice , plesynge to God .
50004019	And my God fil alle youre desire , by hise richessis in glorie in Crist Jhesu .
50004020	But to God and oure fadir be glorie in to worldis of worldis .
50004021	Amen . Grete ye wel euery hooli man in Crist Jhesu .
50004022	Tho britheren that ben with me , greten you wel . Alle hooli men greten you wel , moost sotheli thei that ben of the emperouris hous .
50004023	The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with youre spirit . Amen .
51001001	Poul , apostle of ` Crist Jhesu , bi the wille of God ,
51001002	and Tymothe , brother , to hem that ben at Colose , hooli and feithful britheren in Crist Jhesu ,
51001003	grace and pees to you of God oure fadir and of the Lord Jhesu Crist . We don thankyngis to God , and to the fader of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , euermore preiynge for you , herynge youre feith in Crist Jhesu ,
51001004	and the loue that ye han to alle hooli men ,
51001005	for the hope that is kept to you in heuenes . Which ye herden in the word of treuthe of the gospel ,
51001006	that cam to you , as also it is in al the world , and makith fruyt , and wexith , as in you , fro that dai in which ye herden and knewen the grace of God in treuthe .
51001007	As ye lerneden of Epafras , oure felawe most dereworthe , which is a trewe mynystre of Jhesu Crist for you ;
51001008	which also schewide to vs youre louyng in spirit .
51001009	Therfor we fro the dai in which we herden , ceessen not to preye for you , and to axe , that ye be fillid with the knowing of his wille in al wisdom and goostli vndurstondyng ;
51001010	that ye walke worthili to God plesynge bi alle thingis , and make fruyt in al good werk , and wexe in the science of God ,
51001011	and ben coumfortid in al vertu bi the miyt of his clerenesse , in al pacience and long abiding with ioye ,
51001012	that ye do thankyngis to God and to the fadir , which made you worthi in to the part of eritage of hooli men in liyt .
51001013	Which delyueride vs fro the power of derknessis , and translatide in to the kyngdom of the sone of his louyng ,
51001014	in whom we han ayenbiyng and remyssioun of synnes .
51001015	Which is the ymage of God vnuysible , the first bigetun of ech creature .
51001016	For in hym alle thingis ben maad , in heuenes and in erthe , visible and vnuysible , ether trones , ether dominaciouns , ether princehodes , ethir poweris , alle thingis ben maad of nouyt bi hym , and in hym ,
51001017	and he is bifor alle , and alle thingis ben in hym .
51001018	And he is heed of the bodi of the chirche ; which is the bigynnyng and the firste bigetun of deede men , that he holde the firste dignyte in alle thingis .
51001019	For in hym it pleside al plente to inhabite ,
51001020	and bi hym alle thingis to be recounselid in to hym , and made pees bi the blood of his cros , tho thingis that ben in erthis , ether that ben in heuenes .
51001021	And whanne ye weren sumtyme aliened , and enemyes bi wit in yuele werkis ,
51001022	now he hath recounselid you in the bodi of his fleisch bi deth , to haue you hooli , and vnwemmyd , and with out repreef bifor hym .
51001023	If netheles ye dwellen in the feith , foundid , and stable , and vnmouable fro the hope of the gospel that ye han herd , which is prechid in al creature that is vndur heuene . Of which Y Poul am maad mynystre ,
51001024	and now Y haue ioye in passioun for you , and Y fille tho thingis that failen of the passiouns of Crist in my fleisch , for his bodi , that is the chirche .
51001025	Of which Y Poul am maad mynystre bi the dispensacioun of God , that is youun to me in you ,
51001026	that Y fille the word of God , the priuyte , that was hid fro worldis and generaciouns . But now it is schewid to his seyntis ,
51001027	to whiche God wold make knowun the richessis of the glorie of this sacrament in hethene men , which is Crist in you , the hope of glorie .
51001028	Whom we schewen , repreuynge ech man , and techinge ` ech man in al wisdom , that we offre ech man perfit in Crist Jhesu .
51001029	In which thing also Y trauele in stryuynge bi the worching of hym , that he worchith in me in vertu .
51002001	But Y wole that ye wite , what bisynesse Y haue for you , and for hem that ben at Laodice , and whiche euere saien not my face in fleisch ,
51002002	that her hertis ben coumfortid , and thei ben tauyt in charite , in to alle the richessis of the plente of the vndurstondyng , in to the knowyng of mysterie of God , the fadir of Jhesu Crist ,
51002003	in whom alle the tresouris of wisdom and of science ben hid .
51002004	For this thing Y seie , that no man disseyue you in heiythe of wordis .
51002005	For thouy Y be absent in bodi , bi spirit Y am with you , ioiynge and seynge youre ordre and the sadnesse of youre bileue that is in Crist .
51002006	Therfor as ye han takun Jhesu Crist oure Lord ,
51002007	walke ye in hym , and be ye rootid and bieldid aboue in hym , and confermyd in the bileue , as ye han lerud , aboundinge in hym in doynge of thankyngis .
51002008	Se ye that no man disseyue you bi filosofie and veyn fallace , aftir the tradicioun of men , aftir the elementis of the world , and not aftir Crist .
51002009	For in hym dwellith bodilich al the fulnesse of the Godhed .
51002010	And ye ben fillid in hym , that is heed of al principat and power .
51002011	In whom also ye ben circumcidid in circumcisioun not maad with hoond , in dispoyling of the bodi of fleisch , but in circumcisioun of Crist ;
51002012	and ye ben biried togidere with hym in baptim , in whom also ye han rise ayen bi feith of the worching of God , that reiside hym fro deth .
51002013	And whanne ye weren deed in giltis , and in the prepucie of youre fleisch , he quikenyde togidere you with hym ;
51002014	foryyuynge to you alle giltis , doynge awei that writing of decre that was ayens vs , that was contrarie to vs ; and he took awei that fro the myddil , pitchinge it on the cros ;
51002015	and he spuylide principatis and poweris , and ledde out tristili , opynli ouercomynge hem in hym silf .
51002016	Therfor no man iuge you in mete , or in drink , or in part of feeste dai , or of neomenye ,
51002017	or of sabatis , whiche ben schadewe of thingis to comynge ; for the bodi is of Crist .
51002018	No man disseyue you , willynge to teche in mekenesse , and religioun of aungelis , tho thingis whiche he hath not seyn , walkinge veynli , bolnyd with wit of his fleisch ,
51002019	and not holdynge the heed , of which al the bodi , bi boondis and ioynyngis togidere vndur mynystrid and maad , wexith in to encreessing of God .
51002020	For if ye ben deed with Crist fro the elementis of this world , what yit as men lyuynge to the world demen ye ?
51002021	That ye touche not , nether taaste ,
51002022	nether trete with hoondis tho thingis , whiche alle ben in to deth bi the ilke vss , aftir the comaundementis and the techingis of men ;
51002023	whiche han a resoun of wisdom in veyn religioun and mekenesse , and not to spare the bodi , not in ony onour to the fulfillyng of the fleisch .
51003001	Therfor if ye han risun togidere with Crist , seke ye tho thingis that ben aboue , where Crist is sittynge in the riythalf of God .
51003002	Sauere ye tho thingis , that ben aboue , not tho that ben on the erthe .
51003003	For ye ben deed , and youre lijf is hid with Crist in God .
51003004	For whanne Crist schal appere , youre lijf , thanne also ye schulen appere with hym in glorie .
51003005	Therfor sle ye youre membris , whiche ben on the erthe , fornycacioun , vnclennesse , letcherie , yuel coueitise , and aueryse , which is seruyse of mawmetis ;
51003006	for whiche thingis the wraththe of God cam on the sones of vnbileue ;
51003007	in whiche also ye walkiden sum tyme , whanne ye lyueden in hem .
51003008	But now putte ye awei alle thingis , wraththe , indignacioun , malice , blasfemye and foule word of youre mouth .
51003009	Nyle ye lie togidere ; spuyle ye you fro the elde man with his dedes , and clothe ye the newe man ,
51003010	that is maad newe ayen in to the knowing of God , aftir the ymage of hym that made hym ;
51003011	where is not male and female , hethene man and Jew , circumcisioun and prepucie , barbarus and Scita , bonde man and fre man , but alle thingis and in alle thingis Crist .
51003012	Therfor ye , as the chosun of God , hooli and louyd , clothe you with the entrailis of merci , benygnite , and mekenesse , temperaunce , pacience ;
51003013	and support ye echon other , and foryyue to you silf , if ony man ayens ony hath a querele ; as the Lord foryaf to you , so also ye .
51003014	And vpon alle these thingis haue ye charite , that is the boond of perfeccioun .
51003015	And the pees of Crist enioye in youre hertis , in which ye ben clepid in o bodi , and be ye kynde .
51003016	The word of Crist dwelle in you plenteuousli , in al wisdom ; and teche and moneste you silf in salmes , and ympnes , and spiritual songis , in grace synginge in youre hertis to the Lord .

52001010	whom he reiside fro deth , the Lord Jhesu , that delyuerede us fro wraththe to comynge .
52002001	For , britheren , ye witen oure entre to you , for it was not veyn ;
52002002	but first we suffriden , and weren punyschid with wrongis , as ye witen in Filippis , and hadden trust in oure Lord , to speke to you the gospel of God in myche bisynesse .
52002003	And oure exortacioun is not of errour , nether of vnclennesse , nether in gile ,

52002009	For , britheren , ye ben myndeful of oure trauel and werynesse ; we worchiden nyyt and day , that we schulden not greue ony of you , and prechiden to you the euangelie of God .
52002010	God and ye ben witnessis , hou holili , and iustli , and with outen pleynt , we weren to you that bileueden .

52002013	Therfor we doon thankingis to God with outen ceessyng . For whanne ye hadden take of vs the word ` of the heryng of God , ye token it not as the word of men , but as ` it is verili , the word of God , that worchith in you that han bileued .
52002014	For , britheren , ye ben maad foleweris of the chirchis of God , that ben in Jude , in Crist Jhesu , for ye han suffrid the same thingis of youre euene lynagis , as thei of the Jewis .
52002015	Whiche slowen bothe the Lord Jhesu and the profetis , and pursueden vs , and thei plesen not to God , and thei ben aduersaries to alle men ;
52002016	forbedinge vs to speke to hethene men , that thei be maad saaf , that thei fille her synnes euere more ; for the wraththe of God cam on hem in to the ende .

52002018	For we wolden come to you , yhe , Y Poul , onys and eftsoone , but Sathanas lettide vs .
52002019	For whi what is oure hope , or ioye , or coroun of glorie ? Whether ye ben not bifore oure Lord Jhesu Crist in his comyng ?
52002020	For ye ben oure glorie and ioye .
52003001	For which thing we suffriden no lengere , and it pleside to vs to dwelle aloone at Atenys ;
52003002	and we senten Tymothe , oure brother , and mynystre of God in the euangelie of Crist , to you to be confermyd , and to be tauyt for youre feith ,
52003003	that no man be mouyd in these tribulaciouns . For ye silf witen , that in this this thing we ben set .
52003004	For whanne we weren at you , we biforseiden to you , that we schulden suffre tribulaciouns ; as it is don , and ye witen .
52003005	Therfor Y Poul , no lenger abidinge , sente to knowe youre feith , lest perauenture he that temptith tempte you , and youre trauel be maad veyn .
52003006	But now , whanne Tymothe schal come to vs fro you , and telle to vs youre feith and charite , and that ye han good mynde of vs , euere desyringe to se vs , as we also you ;
52003007	therfor , britheren , we ben coumfortid in you , in al oure nede and tribulacioun , bi youre feith .
52003008	For now we lyuen , if ye stonden in the Lord .
52003009	For what doyng of thankingis moun we yelde to God for you , in al ioye , in which we ioyen for you bifor oure Lord ?
52003010	nyyt and dai more plenteuousli preiynge , that we se youre face , and fulfille tho thingis that failen to youre feith .
52003011	But God hym silf and oure fadir , and the Lord Jhesu Crist , dresse oure weye to you .
52003012	And the Lord multiplie you , and make youre charite to be plenteuouse of ech to othere , and in to alle men , as also we in you ;
52003013	that youre hertis ben confermyd with outen pleynt in holynesse , bifor God and oure fadir , in the comyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist with alle hise seyntis . Amen .
52004001	Therfor , britheren , fro hennus forward we preien you , and bisechen in the Lord Jhesu , that as ye han resseyued of vs , hou it bihoueth you to go and to plese God , so walke ye , that ye abounde the more .
52004002	For ye witen what comaundementis Y haue youun to you bi the Lord Jhesu .
52004003	For this is the wille of God , youre holynesse , that ye absteyne you fro fornycacioun .
52004004	That ech of you kunne welde his vessel in holynesse , and onour ;
52004005	not in passioun of lust , as hethene men that knowen not God .
52004006	And that no man ouergo , nethir disseyue his brothir in chaffaring . For the Lord is venger of alle these thingis , as we biforseiden to you , and han witnessid .
52004007	For God clepide not vs in to vnclennesse , but in to holynesse .
52004008	Therfor he that dispisith these thingis , dispisith not man , but God , that also yaf his holi spirit in vs .
52004009	But of the charite of britherhed we hadden no nede to write to you ; ye silf han lerud of God , that ye loue togidere ;
52004010	for ye don that in to alle britheren in al Macedonye . And , britheren , we preyen you , that ye abounde more ; and taken kepe , that ye be quyet ;
52004011	and that ye do youre nede , and ` ye worche with youre hoondis , as we han comaundid to you ;
52004012	and that ye wandre onestli to hem that ben with outforth , and that of no mannus ye desir ony thing .
52004013	For , britheren , we wolen not , that ye vnknowe of men that dien , that ye be not soreuful , as othere that han not hope .
52004014	For if we bileuen , that Jhesu was deed , and roos ayen , so God schal lede with hym hem that ben deed bi Jhesu .
52004015	And we seien this thing to you in the word of the Lord , that we that lyuen , that ben left in the comyng of the Lord , schulen not come bifor hem that ben deed .
52004016	For the Lord hym silf schal come doun fro heuene , in the comaundement , and in the vois of an archaungel , and in the trumpe of God ; and the deed men that ben in Crist , schulen rise ayen first .
52004017	Afterward we that lyuen , that ben left , schulen be rauyschid togidere with hem in cloudis , metinge Crist ` in to the eir ; and so euere more we schulen be with the Lord .
52004018	Therfor be ye coumfortid togidere in these wordis .
52005001	But , britheren , of tymes and momentis ye neden not that Y write to you .
52005002	For ye silf witen diligentli , that the dai of the Lord schal come , as a theef in the niyt .
52005003	For whanne thei schulen seie pees is , and sikirnesse , thanne sudeyn deth schal come on hem , as sorewe to a womman that is with child , and thei schulen not scape .
52005004	But , britheren , ye ben not in derknessis , that the ilke dai as a theef catche you .
52005005	For alle ye ben the sones of liyt , and sones of dai ; we ben not of niyt , nether of derknessis .
52005006	Therfor slepe we not as othere ; but wake we , and be we sobre .
52005007	For thei that slepen , slepen in the niyt , and thei that ben drunkun , ben drunkun in the niyt .
52005008	But we that ben of the dai , ben sobre , clothid in the haburioun of feith and of charite , and in the helme of hope of heelthe .
52005009	For God puttide not vs in to wraththe , but in to the purchasing of heelthe bi oure Lord Jhesu Crist , that was deed for vs ;
52005010	that whether we waken , whether we slepen , we lyue togidere with him .
52005011	For which thing comforte ye togidere , and edefie ye ech other , as ye doon .
52005012	And , britheren , we preien you , that ye knowen hem that trauelen among you , and ben souereyns to you in the Lord , and techen you ,
52005013	that ye han hem more aboundantli in charyte ; and for the werk of hem , haue ye pees with hem .
52005014	And , britheren , we preien you , repreue ye vnpesible men . Coumforte ye men of litil herte , resseyue ye sijke men , be ye pacient to alle men .
52005015	Se ye , that no man yelde yuel for yuel to ony man ; but euere more sue ye that that is good , ech to othere and to alle men .
52005016	Euere more ioye ye ; without ceessing preye ye ;
52005017	in alle thingis do ye thankyngis .
52005018	For this is the wille of God in Crist Jhesu , in alle you .
52005019	Nyle ye quenche the spirit ;
52005020	nyle ye dispise prophecies .
52005021	But preue ye alle thingis , and holde ye that thing that is good .
52005022	Absteyne you fro al yuel spice .
52005023	And God hym silf of pees make you hooli bi alle thingis , that youre spirit be kept hool , and soule , and bodi , without pleynt , in the comyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
52005024	God is trewe , that clepide you , which also schal do .
52005025	Britheren , preye ye for vs .
52005026	Grete ye wel alle britheren in hooli cos .
52005027	Y coniure you bi the Lord , that this pistle be red to alle hooli britheren .
52005028	The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with you . Amen .
53001001	Poul , and Siluan , and Tymothe , to the chirche of Tessalonicensis , in God oure fadir ,
53001002	and in the Lord Jhesu Crist , grace to you and pees of God , oure fadir , and of the Lord Jhesu Crist .
53001003	We owen to do thankyngis eueremore to God for you , britheren , so as it is worthi , for youre feith ouer wexith , and the charite of ech of you to othere aboundith .
53001004	So that we silf glorien in you in the chirchis of God , for youre pacience and feith in alle youre persecuciouns and tribulaciouns .
53001005	Whiche ye susteynen in to the ensaumple of the iust dom of God , that ye be had worthi in the kingdom of God , for which ye suffren .
53001006	If netheles it is iust tofor God to quite tribulacioun to hem that troblen you ,
53001007	and to you that ben troblid , rest with vs in the schewing of the Lord Jhesu fro heuene , with aungelis of his vertu ,
53001008	in the flawme of fier , that schal yyue veniaunce to hem that knowen not God , and that obeien not to the euangelie of oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
53001009	Whiche schulen suffre euere lastinge peynes , in perischinge fro the face of the Lord , and fro the glorie of his vertu ,
53001010	whanne he schal come to be glorified in hise seyntis , and to be maad wondurful in alle men that bileueden , for oure witnessing is bileuyd on you , in that dai .
53001011	In which thing also we preien euere more for you , that oure God make you worthi to his cleping , and fille al the wille of his goodnesse , and the werk of feith in vertu ;
53001012	that the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be clarified in you , and ye in hym , bi the grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
53002001	But , britheren , we preien you bi the comyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , and of oure congregacioun in to the same comyng ,
53002002	that ye be not mouyd soone fro youre witt , nether be aferd , nether bi spirit , nether bi word , nether bi epistle as sent bi vs , as if the dai of the Lord be nyy .
53002003	No man disseyue you in ony manere . For but dissencioun come first , and the man of synne be schewid , the sonne of perdicioun ,
53002004	that is aduersarie , and is enhaunsid ouer ` al thing that is seid God , or that is worschipid , so that he sitte in the temple of God , and schewe hym silf as if he were God .
53002005	Whether ye holden not , that yit whanne Y was at you , Y seide these thingis to you ?
53002006	And now what withholdith , ye witen , that he be schewid in his tyme .
53002007	For the priuete of wickidnesse worchith now ; oneli that he that holdith now , holde , til he be do awei .
53002008	And thanne thilke wickid man schal be schewid , whom the Lord Jhesu schal sle with the spirit of his mouth , and schal distrie with liytnyng of his comyng ;
53002009	hym , whos comyng is bi the worching of Sathanas , in al vertu , and signes ,
53002010	and grete wondris , false , and in al disseit of wickidnesse , to hem that perischen . For that thei resseyueden not the charite of treuthe , that thei schulden be maad saaf .
53002011	And therfor God schal sende to hem a worching of errour , that thei bileue to leesing ,
53002012	that alle be demed , whiche bileueden not to treuthe , but consentiden to wickidnesse .
53002013	But , britheren louyd of God , we owen to do thankyngis euermore to God for you , that God chees vs the firste fruytis in to heelthe , in halewing of spirit and in feith of treuthe ;
53002014	in which also he clepide you bi oure gospel , in to geting of the glorie of oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
53002015	Therfor , britheren , stonde ye , and holde ye the tradiciouns , that ye han lerud , ethir bi word , ethir bi oure pistle .
53002016	And oure Lord Jhesu Crist him silf , and God oure fadir , which louyde vs , and yaf euerlastinge coumfort and good hope in grace , stire youre hertis ,
53002017	and conferme in al good werk and word .
53003001	Britheren , fro hennus forward preye ye for vs , that the word of God renne , and be clarified , as it is anentis you ;
53003002	and that we be delyuered fro noyous and yuele men ; for feith is not of alle men .
53003003	But the Lord is trewe , that schal conferme you , and schal kepe fro yuel .
53003004	And , britheren , we trusten of you in the Lord , for what euere thingis we comaunden to you , bothe ye don and schulen do .
53003005	And the Lord dresse youre hertis , in the charite of God , and in the pacience of Crist .
53003006	But , britheren , we denouncen to you in the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , that ye withdrawe you from ech brother that wandrith out of ordre , and not aftir the techyng , that thei resseyueden of vs .
53003007	For ` ye silf witen , hou it bihoueth to sue vs . For we weren not vnpesible among you ,
53003008	nethir with outen oure owne trauel we eeten breed of ony man , but in trauel and werynesse worchiden niyt and dai , that we greuyden noon of you .
53003009	Not as we hadden not power , but that we schulden yyue vs silf ensaumple to you to sue vs .
53003010	For also whanne we weren among you , we denounsiden this thing to you , that if ony man wole not worche , nethir ete he .
53003011	For we han herd that summe among you goon in reste , and no thing worchen , but don curiousli .
53003012	But we denouncen to hem that ben suche men , and bisechen in the Lord Jhesu Crist , that thei worchen with silence , and ete her owne breed .
53003013	But nyle ye , britheren , faile wel doynge .
53003014	That if ony man obeie not to oure word bi epistle , marke ye him , and comyne ye not with hym , that he be schamed ;
53003015	and nyle ye gesse hym as an enemye , but repreue ye hym as a brother . And God hym silf of pees yyue to you euerlastinge pees in al place .
53003016	The Lord be with ` you alle .
53003017	My salutacioun bi the hoond of Poul ; which signe in ech epistle Y write thus .
53003018	The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with ` alle you . Amen .
54001001	Poul , apostle ` of Jhesu Crist , bi the comaundement of God oure sauyour , and of Jhesu Crist oure hope ,
54001002	to Tymothe , bilouyd sone in the feith , grace and merci and pees , of God the fadir , and of Jhesu Crist , oure Lord .
54001003	As Y preyede thee , that thou schuldist dwelle at Effesi , whanne Y wente into Macedonye , that thou schuldist denounce to summe men , that thei schulden not teche othere weie ,
54001004	nether yyue tent to fablis and genologies that ben vncerteyn , whiche yyuen questiouns , more than edificacioun of God , that is in the feith .
54001005	For the ende of comaundement is charite of clene herte , and good conscience , and of feith not feyned .
54001006	Fro whiche thingis sum men han errid , and ben turned in to veyn speche ;
54001007	and willith to be techeris of the lawe , and vndurstonden not what thingis thei speken , nether of what thingis thei affermen .
54001008	And we witen that the lawe is good , if ony man vse it lawefulli ;
54001009	and witinge this thing , that the lawe is not set to a iust man , but to vniust men and not suget , to wickid men and to synneris , to cursid men and defoulid , to sleeris of fadir , and sleeris of modir , to ` men sleeris and lechouris ,
54001010	to hem that don letcherie with men , lesingmongeris and forsworun , and if ony othere thing is contrarie to the hoolsum teching ,
54001011	that is aftir the euangelie of the glorie of blessid God , which is bitakun to me .
54001012	Y do thankingis to hym , that coumfortide me in Crist Jhesu oure Lord , for he gesside me feithful , and putte me in mynystrie ,
54001013	that first was a blasfeme , and a pursuere , and ful of wrongis . But Y haue getun the merci of God , for Y vnknowinge dide in vnbileue .
54001014	But the grace of oure Lord ouer aboundide , with feith and loue that is in Crist Jhesu .
54001015	A trewe word and worthi al resseyuyng , for Crist Jhesu cam in to this world to make synful men saaf , of whiche Y am the firste .
54001016	But therfor Y haue getun merci , that Crist Jhesu schulde schewe in me first al pacience , to the enfourmyng of hem that schulen bileue to hym in to euerlastinge lijf .
54001017	And to the king of worldis , vndeedli and vnvysible God aloone , be onour and glorie in to worldis of worldis . Amen .
54001018	I bitake this comaundement to thee , thou sone Timothe , after the prophecies that han be hertofore in thee , that thou traueile in hem a good trauel ,
54001019	hauynge feith and good conscience , which summen casten awei , and perischiden aboute the feith .
54001020	Of whiche is Ymeneus and Alisaundre , which Y bitook to Sathanas , that thei lerne ` to not blasfeme .
54002001	Therfor Y biseche first of alle thingis , that bisechingis , preieris , axyngis , doyngis of thankyngis , ben maad for alle men ,
54002002	for kingis and alle that ben set in hiynesse , that we leden a quyet and a pesible lijf , in al pite and chastite .
54002003	For this thing is good and acceptid bifor God ,
54002004	oure sauyour , that wole that alle men ben maad saaf , and that thei come to the knowyng of treuthe .
54002005	For o God and a mediatour is of God and of men , a man Crist Jhesus ,
54002006	that yaf him silf redempcioun for alle men . Whos witnessing is confermyd in his tymes ;
54002007	in which Y am set a prechour and an apostle . For Y seye treuthe , and Y lie not , that am a techere of hethene men in feith and in treuthe .
54002008	Therfor Y wole , that men preye in al place , liftinge vp clene hondis with outen wraththe and strijf .
54002009	Also wymmen in couenable abite , with schamefastnesse and sobrenesse araiynge hem silf , not in writhun heeris , ethir in gold , ethir peerlis , ethir preciouse cloth ; but that that bicometh wymmen ,
54002010	biheetinge pite bi good werkis .
54002011	A womman lerne in silence , with al subieccioun .
54002012	But Y suffre not a womman to teche , nether to haue lordschip on the hosebonde , but to be in silence .
54002013	For Adam was first formed , aftirward Eue ;
54002014	and Adam was not disseyued , but the womman was disseyued , in breking of the lawe .
54002015	But sche schal be sauyd bi generacioun of children , if sche dwellith perfitli in feith , and loue , and hoolynesse , with sobrenesse .
54003001	A feithful word . If ony man desirith a bishopriche , he desirith a good werk .
54003002	Therfor it bihoueth a byschop to be with out repreef , the hosebonde of o wijf , sobre , prudent , chast , vertewous , holdinge hospitalite , a techere ;
54003003	not youun myche to wyn , not a smytere , but temperat , not ful of chiding , not coueitouse , wel reulinge his hous ,
54003004	and haue sones suget with al chastite ;
54003005	for if ony man kan not gouerne his house , hou schal he haue diligence of the chirche of God ? not new conuertid to the feith ,
54003006	lest he be borun vp in to pride , and falle in to doom of the deuel .
54003007	For it bihoueth hym to haue also good witnessing of hem that ben with outforth , that he falle not in to repreef , and in to the snare of the deuel .
54003008	Also it bihoueth dekenes to be chast , not double tungid , not youun myche to wyn , not suynge foul wynnyng ;
54003009	that han the mysterie of feith in clene conscience .
54003010	But be thei preued first , and mynystre so , hauynge no cryme .
54003011	Also it bihoueth wymmen to be chast , not bacbitinge , sobre , feithful in alle thingis .
54003012	Dekenes be hosebondis of o wijf ; whiche gouerne wel her sones and her housis .
54003013	For thei that mynystren wel , schulen gete a good degre to hem silf , and myche triste in the feith , that is in Crist Jhesu .
54003014	Sone Timothe , Y write to thee these thingis , hopinge that Y schal come soon to thee ;
54003015	but if Y tarie , that thou wite , hou it bihoueth thee to lyue in the hous of God , that is the chirche of lyuynge God , a pilere and sadnesse of treuthe .
54003016	And opynli it is a greet sacrament of pitee , that thing that was schewid in fleisch , it is iustified in spirit , it apperid to aungels , it is prechid to hethene men , it is bileuyd in the world , it is takun vp in glorie .
54004001	But the spirit seith opynli , that in the laste tymes summen schulen departe fro the feith , yyuynge tent to spiritis of errour , and to techingis of deuelis ; that speken leesing in ipocrisie ,
54004002	and haue her conscience corrupt ,
54004003	forbedinge to be weddid , to absteyne fro metis , whiche God made to take with doyng of thankingis , to feithful men , and hem that han knowe the treuthe .
54004004	For ech creature of God is good , and no thing is to be cast awei , which is takun with doyng of thankyngis ;
54004005	for it is halewid bi the word of God , and bi preyer .
54004006	Thou puttynge forth these thingis to britheren , schalt be a good mynystre of Crist Jhesu ; nurschid with wordis of feith and of good doctryne , which thou hast gete .
54004007	But eschewe thou vncouenable fablis , and elde wymmenus fablis ; haunte thi silf to pitee .
54004008	For bodili exercitation is profitable to litle thing ; but pitee is profitable to alle thingis , that hath a biheest of lijf that now is , and that is to come .
54004009	A trewe word , and worthi al acceptacioun .
54004010	And in this thing we trauelen , and ben cursid , for we hopen in lyuyng God , that is sauyour of alle men , moost of feithful men .
54004011	Comaunde thou this thing , and teche .
54004012	No man dispise thi yongthe , but be thou ensaumple of feithful men in word , in lyuyng , in charite , in feith , in chastite .
54004013	Tyl Y come , take tent to redyng , to exortacioun and teching .
54004014	Nyle thou litil charge the grace which is in thee , that is youun to thee bi profecie , with putting on of the hondis of preesthod .
54004015	Thenke thou these thingis , in these be thou , that thi profiting be schewid to alle men .
54004016	Take tent to thi silf and to doctryn ; be bisi in hem . For thou doynge these thingis , schalt ` make bothe thi silf saaf , and hem that heren thee .
54005001	Blame thou not an eldere man , but biseche as a fadir , yonge men as britheren ; elde wymmen as modris ,
54005002	yonge wymmen as sistris , in al chastite .
54005003	Honoure thou widewis , that ben very widewis .
54005004	But if ony widewe hath children of sones , lerne sche first to gouerne her hous , and quyte to fadir and modir ; for this thing is acceptid bifor God .
54005005	And sche that is a widewe verili , and desolate , hope in to God , and be bisy in bisechingis and preieris niyt and dai .
54005006	For sche that is lyuynge in delicis , is deed .
54005007	And comaunde thou this thing , that thei be withouten repreef .
54005008	For if ony man hath not cure of his owne , and most of hise household men , he hath denyed the feith , and is worse than an vnfeithful man .
54005009	A widewe be chosun not lesse than sixti yeer , that was wijf of oon hosebonde ,
54005010	and hath witnessing in good werkis , if sche nurschede children , if sche resseyuede pore men to herbore , if sche hath waischun the feet of hooli men , if sche mynystride to men that suffriden tribulacioun , if sche folewide al good werk .
54005011	But eschewe thou yongere widewis ; for whanne thei han do letcherie , thei wolen be weddid in Crist ,
54005012	hauynge dampnacioun , for thei han maad voide the firste feith .
54005013	Also thei idil lernen to go aboute housis , not oneli ydel , but ful of wordis and curiouse , spekynge thingis that bihoueth not .
54005014	Therfor Y wole , that yongere widewis be weddid , and bringe forth children , and ben hosewyues , to yyue noon occasioun to the aduersarie , bi cause of cursid thing .
54005015	For now summe ben turned abak aftir Sathanas .
54005016	If ony feithful man hath widewis , mynystre he to hem , that the chirche be not greuyd , that it suffice to hem that ben very widewis .
54005017	The prestis that ben wel gouernoures , be thei had worthi to double onour ; moost thei that trauelen in word and teching .
54005018	For scripture seith , Thou schalt not bridil the mouth of the oxe threischinge , and , A werk man is worthi his hire .
54005019	Nyle thou resseyue accusyng ayens a preest , but vndur tweyne or thre witnessis .
54005020	But reproue thou men that synnen bifor alle men , that also othere haue drede .
54005021	Y preie bifor God , and Jhesu Crist , and hise chosun aungelis , that thou kepe these thingis with oute preiudice , and do no thing in bowynge ` in to the othere side .
54005022	Put thou hondis to no man , nether anoon comyne thou with othere mennus synnes . Kepe thi silf chast .
54005023	Nyle thou yit drinke watir , but vse a litil wyn , for thi stomac , and ` for thin ofte fallynge infirmytees .
54005024	Sum mennus synnes ben opyn , bifor goynge to dom ; but of summen thei comen aftir .
54005025	And also goode dedis ben opyn , and tho that han hem in othere maner , moun not be hid .
54006001	What euere seruauntis ben vndur yok , deme thei her lordis worthi al onour , lest the name of the Lord and the doctryn be blasfemyd .
54006002	And thei that han feithful lordis , dispise hem not , for thei ben britheren ; but more serue thei , for thei ben feithful and louyd , whiche ben parceneris of benefice . Teche thou these thingis , and moneste thou these thingis .
54006003	If ony man techith othere wise , and acordith not to the hoolsum wordis of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , and to that teching that is bi pitee ,
54006004	he is proud , and kan no thing , but langwischith aboute questiouns and stryuyng of wordis , of the whiche ben brouyt forth enuyes , stryues , blasfemyes , yuele suspiciouns , fiytingis of men ,
54006005	that ben corrupt in soule , and that ben pryued fro treuthe , that demen wynnyng to be pitee .
54006006	But a greet wynnyng is pitee , with sufficience .
54006007	For we brouyten in no thing in to this world , and no doute , that we moun not bere ` awey ony thing .
54006008	But we hauynge foodis , and with what thingus we schulen be hilid , be we paied with these thingis .
54006009	For thei that wolen be maad riche , fallen in to temptacioun , and ` in to snare of the deuel , and in to many vnprofitable desiris and noyous , whiche drenchen men in to deth and perdicioun .
54006010	For the rote of alle yuelis is coueytise , which summen coueitinge erriden fro the feith , and bisettiden hem with many sorewis .
54006011	But , thou , man of God , fle these thingis ; but sue thou riytwisnesse , pite , feith , charite , pacience , myldenesse .
54006012	Stryue thou a good strijf of feith , catche euerlastinge lijf , in to which thou art clepid , and hast knoulechid a good knouleching bifor many witnessis .
54006013	I comaunde to thee bifor God , that quikeneth alle thingis , and bifor Crist Jhesu , that yeldide a witnessing vnder Pilat of Pounce , a good confessioun ,
54006014	that thou kepe the comaundement with out wem , with out repreef , in to the comyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist ;
54006015	whom the blessid and aloone miyti king of kyngis and Lord of lordis schal schewe in his tymes .
54006016	Which aloone hath vndeedlynesse , and dwellith in liyt , to which no man may come ; whom no man say , nether may se ; to whom glorie , and honour , and empire be with out ende .
54006017	Amen . Comaunde thou to the riche men of this world , that thei vndurstonde not hiyli , nether that thei hope in vncerteynte of richessis , but in the lyuynge God , that yyueth to vs alle thingis plenteuously to vse ;
54006018	to do wel , to be maad riche in good werkis , liytli to yyue ,
54006019	to comyne , to tresoure to hem silf a good foundement in to tyme to comynge , that thei catche euerlastinge lijf .
54006020	Thou Tymothe , kepe the thing bitakun to thee , eschewynge cursid noueltees of voicis , and opynyouns of fals name of kunnyng ;
54006021	which summen bihetinge , aboute the feith fellen doun . The grace of God be with thee . Amen .
55001001	Poul , apostle of Jhesu Crist , bi the wille of God , bi the biheest of lijf that is in Crist Jhesu ,
55001002	to Tymothe , his moost dereworthe sone , grace , merci , and pees of God the fadir , and of Jhesu Crist , oure Lord .
55001003	I do thankyngis to my God , to whom Y serue fro my progenytouris in clene conscience , that with outen ceessyng Y haue mynde of thee in my preyeris ,
55001004	niyt and dai , desirynge to se thee ; hauynge mynde of thi teeris , that Y be fillid with ioye .
55001005	And Y bithenke of that feith , that is in thee not feyned , which also dwellide firste in thin aunte Loide , and in thi modir Eunyce . And Y am certeyn , that also in thee .
55001006	For which cause Y moneste thee , that thou reise ayen the grace of God , that is in thee bi the settyng on of myn hondis .
55001007	For whi God yaf not to vs the spirit of drede , but of vertu , and of loue , and of sobrenesse .
55001008	Therfor nyl thou schame the witnessyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , nether me , his prisoner ; but trauele thou togidere in the gospel bi the vertu of God ;
55001009	that delyueride vs , and clepide with his hooli clepyng , not after oure werkis , but bi his purpos and grace , that is youun in Crist Jhesu bifore worldli tymes ;
55001010	but now it is opyn bi the liytnyng of oure sauyour Jhesu Crist , which destriede deth , and liytnede lijf and vncorrupcioun bi the gospel .
55001011	In which Y am set a prechour and apostle , and maistir of hethene men .
55001012	For which cause also Y suffre these thingis ; but Y am not confoundid . For Y woot to whom Y haue bileuyd , and Y am certeyne that he is miyti for to kepe that is take to my keping in to that dai .
55001013	Haue thou the fourme of hoolsum wordis , whiche thou herdist of me in feith and loue in Crist Jhesu .
55001014	Kepe thou the good takun to thi kepyng bi the Hooli Goost , that dwellith in vs .
55001015	Thou wost this , that alle that ben in Asie ben turnyd awey fro me , of whiche is Figelus and Ermogenes .
55001016	The Lord yyue merci to the hous of Onesyforus , for ofte he refreischide me , and schamyde not my chayne .
55001017	But whanne he cam to Rome , he souyte me bisili , and foond .
55001018	The Lord yyue to hym to fynde merci of God in that dai . And hou grete thingis he mynystride to me at Effesi , thou knowist betere .
55002001	Therfor thou , my sone , be coumfortid in grace that is in Crist Jhesu .
55002002	And what thingis thou hast herd of me bi many witnessis , bitake thou these to feithful men , whiche schulen ` be also able to teche othere men .
55002003	Trauele thou as a good knyyt of Crist Jhesu .
55002004	No man holdinge knyythod to God , wlappith hym silf with worldli nedis , that he plese to hym , to whom he hath preuyd hym silf .
55002005	For he that fiytith in a batel , schal not be corowned , but he fiyte lawfuli .
55002006	It bihoueth an erthetiliere to resseyue first of the fruytis .
55002007	Vndurstonde thou what thingis Y seie . For the Lord schal yyue to thee vndurstonding in alle thingis .
55002008	Be thou myndeful that the Lord Jhesu Crist of the seed of Dauid hath rise ayen fro deth ,
55002009	aftir my gospel , in which Y trauele ` til to boondis , as worching yuele , but the word of God is not boundun .
55002010	Therfor Y suffre alle thingis for the chosun , that also thei gete the heelthe , that is in Crist Jhesu , with heuenli glorie .
55002011	A trewe word , that if we ben deed togidere , also we schulen liue togidere ;
55002012	if we suffren , we schulen regne togidere ; if we denyen , he schal denye vs ;
55002013	if we bileuen not , he dwellith feithful , he mai not denye hym silf .
55002014	Teche thou these thingis , witnessinge bifore God . Nyle thou stryue in wordis ; for to no thing it is profitable , but to the subuerting of men that heren .
55002015	Bisili kepe to yyue thi silf a preued preisable werkman to God , with oute schame , riytli tretinge the word of treuthe .
55002016	But eschewe thou vnhooli and veyn spechis , for whi tho profiten myche to vnfeithfulnesse ,
55002017	and the word of hem crepith as a canker . Of whiche Filete is , and Ymeneus ,
55002018	whiche felden doun fro the treuthe , seiynge that the rising ayen is now doon , and thei subuertiden the feith of summen .
55002019	But the sad foundement of God stondith , hauynge this marke , The Lord knowith whiche ben hise , and , Ech man that nameth the name of the Lord , departith fro wickidnesse .
55002020	But in a greet hous ben not oneli vessels of gold and of siluer , but also of tree and of erthe ; and so summen ben in to onour , and summe in to dispit .
55002021	Therfor if ony man clensith hym silf fro these , he schal be a vessel halewid in to onour , and profitable to the Lord , redi to al good werk .
55002022	And fle thou desiris of yongthe , but sue thou riytwisnesse , feith , charite , pees , with hem that inwardli clepen the Lord of a clene herte .
55002023	And eschewe thou foltische questiouns , and without kunnyng , wytynge that tho gendren chidyngis .
55002024	But it bihoueth the seruaunt of the Lord to chide not ; but to be mylde to alle men , able to teche ,
55002025	paciente , with temperaunce repreuynge hem that ayenstonden the treuthe , that sum tyme God yyue to hem forthenkyng , that thei knowen the treuthe ,
55002026	and that thei rise ayen fro the snares of the deuel , of whom thei ben holdun prisoneris at his wille .
55003001	But wite thou this thing , that in the laste daies perelouse tymes schulen neiye , and men schulen be louynge hem silf ,
55003002	coueitouse , hiy of bering , proude , blasfemeris , not obedient to fadir and modir , vnkynde ,
55003003	cursid , with outen affeccioun , with out pees , false blameris , vncontynent , vnmylde ,
55003004	with out benygnyte , traitouris , ouerthwert , bollun with proude thouytis , blynde , loueris of lustis more than of God ,
55003005	hauynge the licknesse of pitee , but denyynge the vertu of it . And eschewe thou these men .
55003006	Of these thei ben that persen housis , and leden wymmen caitifs chargid with synnes , whiche ben led with dyuerse desiris , euere more lernynge ,
55003007	and neuere perfitli comynge to the science of treuthe .
55003008	And as Jannes and Mambres ayenstoden Moises , so these ayenstonden treuthe , men corrupt in vndirstonding , repreuyd aboute the feith .
55003009	But ferthere thei schulen not profite , for the vnwisdom of hem schal be knowun to alle men , as hern was .
55003010	But thou hast getun my teching , ordinaunce , purposing , feith , long abiding , loue ,
55003011	pacience , persecuciouns , passiouns , whiche weren maad to me at Antioche , at Ycony , at Listris , what maner persecucyouns Y suffride , and the Lord hath delyuered me of alle .
55003012	And alle men that wolen lyue feithfuli in Crist Jhesu , schulen suffre persecucioun .
55003013	But yuele men and disseyueris schulen encreese in to worse , errynge , and sendinge in to errour .
55003014	But dwelle thou in these thingis that thou hast lerud , and that ben bitakun to thee , witinge of whom thou hast lerud ;
55003015	for thou hast knowun hooli lettris fro thi youthe , whiche moun lerne thee to heelthe , bi feith that is in Crist Jhesu .
55003016	For al scripture inspirid of God is profitable to teche , to repreue , to chastice , to lerne in riytwisnes ,
55003017	that the man of God be parfit , lerud to al good werk .
55004001	I witnesse bifore God and Crist Jhesu , that schal deme the quike and the deed , and bi the comyng of hym , and the kyngdom of hym ,
55004002	preche the word , be thou bisi couenabli with outen rest , repreue thou , biseche thou , blame thou in al pacience and doctryn .
55004003	For tyme schal be , whanne men schulen not suffre hoolsum teching , but at her desiris thei schulen gadere ` togidere to hem silf maistris yitchinge to the eeris .
55004004	And treuli thei schulen turne awei the heryng fro treuthe , but to fablis thei schulen turne .
55004005	But wake thou , in alle thingis traueile thou , do the werk of an euangelist , fulfille thi seruyce , be thou sobre .
55004006	For Y am sacrifisid now , and the tyme of my departyng is nyy .
55004007	Y haue stryuun a good strijf , Y haue endid the cours , Y haue kept the feith .
55004008	In ` the tothir tyme a coroun of riytwisnesse is kept to me , which the Lord , a iust domesman , schal yelde to me in that dai ; and not oneli to me , but also to these that louen his comyng .
55004009	Hyye thou to come to me soone . For Demas , louynge this world , hath forsakun me , and wente to Tessalonyk ,
55004010	Crescens in to Galathi , Tite in to Dalmacie ;
55004011	Luk aloone is with me . Take thou Mark , and brynge with thee ; for he is profitable to me in to seruyce .
55004012	Forsothe Y sente Titicus to Effesi .
55004013	The cloth which Y lefte at Troade at Carpe , whanne thou comest , bringe with thee , and the bookis , but moost parchemyne .
55004014	Alisaundre , the tresorer , schewide to me myche yuele ; ` the Lord schal yelde to hym aftir his werkis .
55004015	Whom also thou eschewe ; for he ayenstood ful greetli oure wordis .
55004016	In my firste defence no man helpide me , but alle forsoken me ; be it not arettid to hem .
55004017	But the Lord helpide me , and coumfortide me , that the preching be fillid bi me , and that alle folkis here , that Y am delyueride fro the mouth of the lioun .
55004018	And the Lord delyueride me fro al yuel werk , and schal make me saaf in to his heuenly kingdom , to whom be glorie in to worldis of worldis .
55004019	Amen . Grete wel Prisca , and Aquila , and the hous of Oneseforus .
55004020	Erastus lefte at Corynthi , and Y lefte Trofymus sijk at Mylete .
55004021	Hiye thou to come bifore wyntir . Eubolus , and Prudent , and Lynus , and Claudia , and alle britheren , greten thee wel .
55004022	Oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with thi spirit . The grace of God be with you . Amen .

56001003	but he hath schewid in hise tymes his word in preching , that is bitakun to me bi the comaundement of ` God oure sauyour ,
56001004	to Tite , most dereworthe sone bi the comyn feith , grace and pees of God the fadir , and of Crist Jhesu , oure sauyour .
56001005	For cause of this thing Y lefte thee at Crete , that thou amende tho thingis that failen , and ordeyne preestis bi citees , as also Y disposide to thee .
56001006	If ony man is withoute cryme , an hosebonde of o wijf , and hath feithful sones , not in accusacioun of letcherie , or not suget .
56001007	For it bihoueth a bischop to be without cryme , a dispendour of God , not proud , not wrathful , not drunkelew , not smytere , not coueytouse of foul wynnyng ;
56001008	but holdinge hospitalite , benygne , prudent , sobre , iust ,
56001009	hooli , contynent , takinge that trewe word , that is aftir doctryn ; that he be miyti to amoneste in hoolsum techyng , and to repreue hem that ayenseien .
56001010	For ther ben many vnobedient , and veyn spekeris , and disseyueris , moost thei that ben of circumcisyoun ,
56001011	whiche it bihoueth to be repreued ; whiche subuerten alle housis , techinge whiche thingis it bihoueth not , for the loue of foul wynnyng .
56001012	And oon of hem , her propre profete , seide , Men of Crete ben euere more lyeris , yuele beestis , of slowe wombe .
56001013	This witnessyng is trewe . For what cause blame hem sore , that thei be hool in feith ,
56001014	not yyuynge tent to fablis of Jewis , and to maundementis of men , that turnen awei hem fro treuthe .
56001015	And alle thingis ben clene to clene men ; but to vnclene men and to vnfeithful no thing is clene , for the soule and conscience of hem ben maad vnclene .
56001016	Thei knoulechen that thei knowen God , but bi dedis thei denyen ; whanne thei ben abhominable , and vnbileueful , and repreuable to al good werk .
56002001	But speke thou tho thingis that bisemen hoolsum teching ;
56002002	that elde men be sobre , chast , prudent , hool in feith , in loue , and pacience ;
56002003	also olde wymmen in hooli abite , not sclaundereris , not seruynge myche to wyn , wel techynge , that thei teche prudence .
56002004	Moneste thou yonge wymmen , that thei loue here hosebondis , that thei loue her children ;
56002005	and that thei be prudent , chast , sobre , hauynge cure of the hous , benygne , suget to her hosebondis , that the word of God be not blasfemyd .
56002006	Also moneste thou yonge men , that thei be sobre .
56002007	In alle thingis yyue thi silf ensaumple of good werkis , in teching , in hoolnesse , in sadnesse .
56002008	An hoolsum word , and vnrepreuable ; that he that is of the contrarie side , be aschamed , hauynge noon yuel thing to seie of you .
56002009	Moneste thou seruauntis to be suget to her lordis ; in alle thingis plesinge , not ayenseiynge , not defraudynge ,
56002010	but in alle thingis schewinge good feith , that thei onoure in alle thingis the doctryn of ` God , oure sauyour .
56002011	For the grace of ` God , oure sauyour ,
56002012	hath apperid to alle men , and tauyte vs , that we forsake wickidnesse , and worldli desyris , lyue sobreli , and iustli , ` and piteuousli in this world ,
56002013	abidinge the blessid hope and the comyng of the glorie of the greet God , and of oure sauyour Jhesu Crist ;
56002014	that yaf hym silf for vs , to ayenbie vs fro al wickidnesse , and make clene to hym silf a puple acceptable , and suere of good werkis .
56002015	Speke thou these thingis , and moneste thou , and repreue thou with al comaundement ; no man dispise thee .
56003001	Amoneste hem to be sugetis to prynces , and to poweris ; to obeische to that that is seid , and to be redi to al good werk ;
56003002	to blasfeme no man , to be not ful of chiding , but temperat , schewynge al myldenesse to alle men .
56003003	For we weren sum tyme vnwise , vnbileueful , errynge , and seruynge to desiris , and to dyuerse lustis , doynge in malice and enuye , worthi to be hatid , hatinge ech othere .
56003004	But whanne the benygnyte and the manhed of oure sauyour God aperide ,
56003005	not of werkis of riytwisnesse that we diden , but bi his merci he made vs saaf , bi waischyng of ayen bigetyng , and ayen newyng of the Hooli Goost ,
56003006	whom he schedde into vs plenteuousli bi Jhesu Crist ,
56003007	oure saueour , that we iustified bi his grace , ben eiris by hope of euerlastinge lijf .
56003008	A trewe word is , and of these thingis Y wole that thou conferme othere , that thei that bileuen to God , be bisy to be aboue othere in good werkis . These thingis ben good , and profitable to men .
56003009	And eschewe thou foltische questiouns , and genologies , and stryues , and fiytyngis of the lawe ; for tho ben vnprofitable and veyn .
56003010	Eschewe thou a man eretik , aftir oon and the secound correccioun ;
56003011	witinge that he that is siche a maner man is subuertid , and trespassith , and is dampned bi his owne dom .
56003012	Whanne Y sende to thee Arteman , or Titicus , hiy thou to ` come to me to Nycopolis ; for Y haue purposid to dwelle in wyntir there .
56003013	Bisili byfor sende Zenam , a wise man of lawe , and Apollo , that no thing faile to hem .
56003014	Thei that ben of ouris , lerne to be gouernouris in good werkis , to necessarie vsis , that thei be not with out fruyt .
56003015	Alle men that ben with me greeten thee wel . Grete thou wel hem , that louen vs in feith . The grace of God be with you alle . Amen .
57001001	Poul , the boundun of Crist Jhesu , and Timothe , brother , to Filemon , bilouyd , and oure helpere , and to Appia ,
57001002	most dere sister , and to Archip , oure euene kniyt , and to the chirche that is in thin hous ,
57001003	grace be to you , and pees of God oure fader , and of the Lord Jhesu Crist .
57001004	I do thankingis to my God , euere more makinge mynde of thee in my preieris ,
57001005	heringe thi charite and feith , that thou hast in the Lord Jhesu , and to alle hooli men ,
57001006	that the comynyng of thi feith be maad opyn , in knowing of al good thing in Crist Jhesu .
57001007	And Y hadde greet ioye and coumfort in thi charite , for the entrailis of hooli men restiden bi thee , brother .
57001008	For which thing Y hauynge myche trist in Crist Jhesu , to comaunde to thee that that perteyneth to profit ;
57001009	but Y biseche more for charite , sithen thou art siche as the elde Poul , and now the boundun of Jhesu Crist .
57001010	Y biseche thee for my sone Onesyme , whom Y in boondis bigat ,
57001011	which sumtyme was vnprofitable to thee , but now profitable bothe to thee and to me ; whom Y sente ayen to thee .
57001012	And resseyue thou hym as myn entrailis ;
57001013	whom Y wolde withholde with me , that he schulde serue for thee to me in boondis of the gospel ;
57001014	but with out thi counseil Y wolde not do ony thing , that thi good schulde not be as of nede , but wilful .
57001015	For perauenture therfor he departide fro thee for a tyme , that thou schuldist resseyue hym with outen ende ;
57001016	now not as a seruaunt , but for a seruaunt a most dere brother , most to me ; and how myche more to thee , bothe in fleisch and in the Lord ?
57001017	Therfor if thou hast me a felowe , resseyue hym as me ; for if he hath ony thing anoied thee ,
57001018	ethir owith , arette thou this thing to me .
57001019	Y Poul wroot with myn hoond , Y schal yelde ; that Y seie not to thee , that also thou owist to me thi silf .
57001020	So , brothir , Y schal vse thee in the Lord ; fille thou myn entrails in Crist .
57001021	Y tristnynge of thin obedience wroot to thee , witynge that thou schalt do ouer that that Y seie .
57001022	Also make thou redi to me an hous to dwelle in ; for Y hope that bi youre preyeris Y schal be youun to you .
57001023	Epafras , prisoner with me in Crist Jhesu ,
57001024	greetith thee wel , and Mark , Aristark , Demas , Lucas , myn helperis .
57001025	The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with youre spirit . Amen .
58001001	God , that spak sum tyme bi prophetis in many maneres to oure fadris , at the
58001002	laste in these daies he hath spoke to vs bi the sone ; whom he hath ordeyned eir of alle thingis , and bi whom he made the worldis .
58001003	Which whanne also he is the briytnesse of glorie , and figure of his substaunce , and berith alle thingis bi word of his vertu , he makith purgacioun of synnes , and syttith on the riythalf of the maieste in heuenes ;
58001004	and so myche is maad betere than aungels , bi hou myche he hath eneritid a more dyuerse name bifor hem .
58001005	For to whiche of the aungels seide God ony tyme , Thou art my sone , Y haue gendrid thee to dai ? And eftsoone , Y schal be to hym in to a fadir , and he schal be to me in to a sone ?
58001006	And whanne eftsoone he bryngith in the firste bigetun sone in to the world , he seith , And alle the aungels of God worschipe hym .
58001007	But he seith to aungels , He that makith hise aungels spiritis , and hise mynystris flawme of fier .
58001008	But to the sone he seith , God , thi trone is in to the world of world ; a yerde of equite is the yerde of thi rewme ;
58001009	thou hast louyd riytwisnesse , and hatidist wickidnesse ; therfor the God , thi God , anoyntide thee with oile of ioye , more than thi felowis .
58001010	And , Thou , Lord , in the bigynnyng foundidist the erthe , and heuenes ben werkis of thin hondis ; thei schulen perische ,
58001011	but thou schalt perfitli dwelle ; and alle schulen wexe elde as a cloth , and thou schalt chaunge hem as a cloth ,
58001012	and thei schulen be chaungid . But thou art the same thi silf , and thi yeeris schulen not faile .
58001013	But to whiche of the aungels seide God at ony tyme , Sitte thou on my riythalf , till Y putte thin enemyes a stool of thi feet ?
58001014	Whether thei alle ben not seruynge spiritis , sente to seruen for hem that taken the eritage of heelthe ?
58002001	Therfor more plenteuousli it bihoueth vs to kepe tho thingis , that we han herd , lest perauenture we fleten awei .
58002002	For if the ilke word that was seid bi aungels , was maad sad , and ech brekyng of the lawe and vnobedience took iust retribucioun of meede ,
58002003	hou schulen we ascape , if we despisen so greet an heelthe ? Which , whanne it hadde takun bigynnyng to be teld out by the Lord , of hem that herden is confermyd in to vs .
58002004	For God witnesside to gidere bi myraclis , and wondris , and grete merueilis , and dyuerse vertues , and departyngis of the Hooli Goost , bi his wille .
58002005	But not to aungels God sugetide the world that is to comynge , of which we speken .
58002006	But sum man witnesside in a place , and seide , What thing is man , that thou art myndeful of hym , or mannus sone , for thou visitist hym ?
58002007	Thou hast maad hym a litil lesse than aungels ; thou hast corowned hym with glorie and onour ; and thou hast ordeyned him on the werkis of thin hondis .
58002008	Thou hast maad alle thingis suget vndur hise feet . And in that that he sugetide alle thingis to hym , he lefte no thing vnsuget to him . But now we seen not yit alle thingis suget to hym ;
58002009	but we seen hym that was maad a litil lesse than aungels , Jhesu , for the passioun of deth crowned with glorie and onour , that he thorouy grace of God schulde taste deth for alle men .
58002010	For it bisemede hym , for whom alle thingis , and bi whom ` alle thingis weren maad , which hadde brouyt many sones into glorie , and was auctour of the heelthe of hem , that he hadde an ende bi passioun .
58002011	For he that halewith , and thei that ben halewid , ben alle of oon ; for which cause he is not schamed to clepe hem britheren ,
58002012	seiynge , Y schal telle thi name to my britheren ; in the myddil of the chirche Y schal herie thee .
58002013	And eftsoone , Y schal be tristnynge in to hym ; and eftsoone , Lo ! Y and my children , whiche God yaf to me .
58002014	Therfor for children comyneden to fleisch and blood , and he also took part of the same , that bi deth he schulde destrie hym that hadde lordschipe of deth , that is to seie , the deuel ,
58002015	and that he schulde delyuere hem that bi drede of deth , ` bi al lijf weren boundun to seruage .
58002016	And he took neuere aungelis , but he took the seed of Abraham .
58002017	Wherfor he ouyte to be likned to britheren bi alle thingis , that he schulde be maad merciful and a feithful bischop to God , that he schulde be merciful to the trespassis of the puple .
58002018	For in that thing in which he suffride , and was temptid , he is miyti to helpe also hem that ben temptid .
58003001	Therfor , hooli britheren , and parceneris of heuenli cleping , biholde ye the apostle and the bischop of oure confessioun , Jhesu ,
58003002	which is trewe to hym that made hym , as also Moises in al the hous of hym .
58003003	But this byschop is had worthi of more glorie than Moises , bi as myche as he hath more honour of the hous , that made the hous .
58003004	For ech hous is maad of sum man ; he that made alle thingis of nouyt is God .
58003005	And Moises was trewe in al his hous , as a seruaunt , in to witnessyng of tho thingis that weren to be seid ;
58003006	but Crist as a sone in his hous . Which hous we ben , if we holden sad trist and glorie of hope in to the ende .
58003007	Wherfor as the Hooli Goost seith , To dai , if ye han herd his vois , nyle ye hardne youre hertis ,
58003008	as in wraththing , lijk the dai of temptacioun in desert ;
58003009	where youre fadris temptiden me , and preueden , and siyen my werkis fourti yeeris .
58003010	Wherfor Y was wrooth to this generacioun , and Y seide , Euere more thei erren in herte , for thei knewen not my weies ;
58003011	to whiche Y swore in my wraththe , thei schulen not entre in to my reste .
58003012	Britheren , se ye , lest perauenture in ony of you be an yuel herte of vnbileue , to departe fro the lyuynge God .
58003013	But moneste you silf bi alle daies , the while to dai is named , that noon of you be hardned bi fallas of synne .
58003014	For we ben maad parceneris of Crist , if netheles we holden the bigynnyng of his substaunce sad in to the ende .
58003015	While it is seid , to dai , if ye han herd the vois of hym , nyle ye hardne youre hertis , as in that wraththing .
58003016	For summen heringe wraththiden , but not alle thei that wenten out of Egipt bi Moises .
58003017	But to whiche was he wraththid fourti yeeris ? Whether not to hem that synneden , whos careyns weren cast doun in desert ?
58003018	And to whiche swoor he , that thei schulden not entre in to the reste of hym , not but to hem that weren vnbileueful ?
58003019	And we seen , that thei myyten not entre in to the reste of hym for vnbileue .
58004001	Therfor drede we , lest perauenture while the biheest of entryng in to his reste is left , that ony of vs be gessid to be awei .
58004002	For it is told also to vs , as to hem . And the word that was herd profitide not to hem , not meynd to feith of tho thingis that thei herden .
58004003	For we that han bileued , schulen entre in to reste , as he seide , As Y swoor in my wraththe , thei schulen not entre in to my reste . And whanne the werkis weren maad perfit at the ordynaunce of the world ,
58004004	he seide thus in a place of the seuenthe dai , And God restide in the seuenthe dai from alle hise werkis .
58004005	And in this place eftsoone , Thei schulen not entre in to my reste .
58004006	Therfor for it sueth , that summen schulen entre in to it , and thei to whiche it was teld to bifor , entriden not for her vnbileue .
58004007	Eftsoone he termyneth sum dai , and seith in Dauith , To dai , aftir so myche tyme of tyme , as it is biforseid , To dai if ye han herd his vois , nyle ye hardne youre hertis .
58004008	For if Jhesus hadde youun reste to hem , he schulde neuere speke of othere aftir this dai .
58004009	Therfor the sabat is left to the puple of God .
58004010	For he that is entrid in to his reste , restide of hise werkis , as also God of hise .
58004011	Therfor haste we to entre in to that reste , that no man falle in to the same ensaumple of vnbileue . For the word of God is quyk ,
58004012	and spedi in worching , and more able to perse than any tweyne eggid swerd , and stretchith forth to the departynge of the soule and of the spirit , and of the ioynturis and merewis , and demere of thouytis , and of intentis and hertis .
58004013	And no creature is vnuisible in the siyt of God . For alle thingis ben nakid and opyn to hise iyen , to whom a word to vs .
58004014	Therfor we that han a greet bischop , that perside heuenes , Jhesu , the sone of God , holde we the knoulechyng of oure hope .
58004015	For we han not a bischop , that may not haue compassioun on oure infirmytees , but was temptid bi alle thingis bi lycnesse , with oute synne .
58004016	Therfor go we with trist to the trone of his grace , that we gete merci , and fynde grace in couenable help .
58005001	For ech bischop takun of men , is ordeyned for men in these thingis ` that ben to God , that he offre yiftis and sacrifices for synnes .
58005002	Which may togidere sorewe with hem , that beth vnkunnynge and erren ; for also he is enuyrounned with infirmytee .
58005003	And therfor he owith , as for the puple , so also for hym silf , to offre for synnes .
58005004	Nethir ony man taketh to hym onour , but he that is clepid of God , as Aaron was .
58005005	So Crist clarifiede not hym silf , that he were bischop , but he that spak to hym , Thou art my sone , to dai Y gendride thee .
58005006	As ` in anothere place he seith , Thou art a prest with outen ende , aftir the ordre of Melchisedech .
58005007	Which in the daies of his fleisch offride , with greet cry and teeris , preieris and bisechingis to hym that myyte make hym saaf fro deth , and was herd for his reuerence .
58005008	And whanne he was Goddis sone , he lernyde obedience of these thingis that be suffride ;
58005009	and he brouyt to the ende is maad cause of euerlastinge heelthe to alle that obeischen to hym , and is clepid of God a bischop ,
58005010	bi the ordre of Melchisedech .
58005011	Of whom ther is to vs a greet word for to seie , and able to be expowned , for ye ben maad feble to here .
58005012	For whanne ye ouyten to be maistris for tyme , eftsoone ye neden that ye be tauyt , whiche ben the lettris of the bigynnyng of Goddis wordis . And ye ben maad thilke , to whiche is nede of mylk , and not sad mete .
58005013	For ech that is parcenere of mylk , is with out part of the word of riytwisnesse , for he is a litil child .
58005014	But of perfit men is sad mete , of hem that for custom han wittis exercisid to discrecioun of good and of yuel .
58006001	Therfor we bringinge in a word of the bigynnyng of Crist , be we borun to the perfeccioun of hym , not eftsoone leggynge the foundement of penaunce fro deed werkis , and of the feith to God , and of teching of baptimys ,
58006002	and of leiynge on of hondis , and of risyng ayen of deed men , and of the euerlastinge doom .
58006003	And this thing we schulen do , if God schal suffre .
58006004	But it is impossible , that thei that ben onys liytned , and ` han tastid also an heuenly yifte , and ben maad parceneris of the Hooli Goost ,
58006005	and netheles han tastid the good word of God , and the vertues of the world to comynge , and ben slidun fer awei ,
58006006	that thei be renewid eftsoone to penaunce . Whiche eftsones crucifien to hem silf the sone of God , and han to scorn .
58006007	For the erthe that drinkith reyn ofte comynge on it , and bringith forth couenable erbe to hem of whiche it is tilid , takith blessing of God .
58006008	But that that is bringinge forth thornes and breris , is repreuable , and next to curs , whos endyng schal be in to brennyng .
58006009	But , ye moost dereworthe , we tristen of you betere thingis , and neer to helthe , thouy we speken so .
58006010	For God is not vniust , that he foryete youre werk and loue , whiche ye han schewid in his name ; for ye han mynystrid to seyntis , ` and mynistren .
58006011	And we coueiten that ech of you schewe the same bisynesse to the fillyng of hope in to the ende ;
58006012	that ye be not maad slowe , but also sueris of hem , whiche bi feith and pacience schulen enherite the biheestis .
58006013	For God bihetinge to Abraham , for he hadde noon grettere , bi whom he schulde swere , swoor bi hym silf ,
58006014	and seide , Y blessinge schal blesse thee , and Y multipliynge schal multiplie thee ;
58006015	and so he long abidinge hadde the biheeste .
58006016	For men sweren bi a grettere than hem silf , and the ende of al her ple is an ooth to confirmacioun .
58006017	In which thing God willynge to schewe plenteuouslier to the eiris of his biheest the sadnesse of his counsel ,
58006018	puttide bitwixe an ooth , that bi twey thingis vnmeuable , bi whiche it is impossible that God lie , we han a strengeste solace , ` we that fleen togidere to holde the hope that is put forth to vs .
58006019	Which hope as an ankir we han sikir to the soule , and sad , and goynge in to the ynnere thingis of hiding ;
58006020	where the bifore goere , Jhesus , that is maad bischop with outen ende bi the ordre of Melchisedech , entride for vs .
58007001	And this Melchisedech , king of Salem , and preest of the hiyeste God , which mette with Abraham , as he turnede ayen fro the sleyng of kyngis , and blesside hym ;
58007002	to whom also Abraham departide tithis of alle thingis ; first he is seid king of riytwisnesse , and aftirward kyng of Salem , that is to seie , king of pees ,
58007003	with out fadir , with out modir , with out genologie , nether hauynge bigynnyng of daies , nether ende of lijf ; and he is lickened to the sone of God , and dwellith preest with outen ende .
58007004	But biholde ye how greet is this , to whom Abraham the patriark yaf tithis of the beste thingis .
58007005	For men of the sones of Leuy takinge presthod han maundement to take tithis of the puple , bi the lawe , that is to seie , of her britheren , thouy also thei wenten out of the leendis of Abraham .
58007006	But he whos generacioun is not noumbrid in hem , took tithis of Abraham ; and he blesside this Abraham , which hadde repromyssiouns .
58007007	With outen ony ayenseiyng , that that is lesse , is blessid of the betere .
58007008	And heere deedli men taken tithis ; but there he berith witnessyng , that he lyueth .
58007009	And that it be seid so , bi Abraham also Leuy , that took tithis , was tithid ; and yit he was in his fadris leendis ,
58007010	whanne Melchisedech mette with hym .
58007011	Therfor if perfeccioun was bi the preesthood of Leuy , for vndur hym the puple took the lawe , what yit was it nedeful , another preest to rise , bi the ordre of Melchisedech , and not to be seid bi the ordre of Aaron ?
58007012	For whi whanne the preesthod is translatid , it is nede that also translacioun of the lawe be maad .
58007013	But he in whom these thingis ben seid , is of another lynage , of which no man was preest to the auter .
58007014	For it is opyn , that oure Lord is borun of Juda , in which lynage Moises spak no thing of preestis .
58007015	And more yit it is knowun , if bi the ordre of Melchisedech another preest is risun vp ;
58007016	which is not maad bi the lawe of fleischli maundement , but bi vertu of lijf that may not be vndon .
58007017	For he witnessith , That thou art a preest with outen ende , bi the ordre of Melchisedech ;
58007018	that repreuyng of the maundement bifor goynge is maad , for the vnsadnesse and vnprofit of it .
58007019	For whi the lawe brouyt no thing to perfeccioun , but there is a bringing in of a betere hope , bi which we neiyen to God .
58007020	And hou greet it is , not with out sweryng ; but the othere ben maad preestis with outen an ooth ;
58007021	but this preest with an ooth , bi hym that seide ` to hym , The Lord swoor , and it schal not rewe hym , Thou art a preest with outen ende , bi the ordre of Melchisedech ;
58007022	in so myche Jhesus is maad biheetere of the betere testament .
58007023	And the othere weren maad manye preestis , ` therfor for thei weren forbedun bi deth to dwelle stille ;
58007024	but this , for he dwellith with outen ende , hath an euerlastynge preesthod .
58007025	Wherfor also he may saue with outen ende , comynge nyy bi hym silf to God , and euermore lyueth to preye for vs .
58007026	For it bisemyde that sich a man were a bischop to vs , hooli , innocent , vndefoulid , clene , departid fro synful men , and maad hiyere than heuenes ;
58007027	which hath not nede ech dai , as prestis , first for hise owne giltis to offre sacrifices , and aftirward for the puple ; for he dide this thing in offringe hym silf onys .
58007028	And the lawe ordeynede men prestis hauynge sijknesse ; but the word of swering , which is after the lawe , ordeynede the sone perfit with outen ende .
58008001	But a capitle on tho thingis that ben seid . We han siche a bischop , that sat in the riythalf of the seete of greetnesse in heuenes ,
58008002	the mynystre of seyntis , and of the veri tabernacle , that God made , and not man .
58008003	For ech bischop is ordeyned to offre yiftis and sacrificis ; wherfor it is nede , that also this bischop haue sum thing that he schal offre .
58008004	Therfor if he were on erthe , he were no preest , whanne ther weren that schulden offre yiftis bi the lawe ,
58008005	whiche seruen to the saumpler and schadewe of heueneli thingis . As it was answerid to Moises , whanne he schulde ende the tabernacle , Se , he seide , make thou alle thingis bi the saumpler , that is schewid to thee in the mount .
58008006	But now he hath getun a betere mynysterie , bi so myche as he is a mediatour of a betere testament , which is confermyd with betere biheestis .
58008007	For if the ilke firste hadde lackid blame , the place of the secounde schulde not haue be souyt .
58008008	For he repreuynge hem seith , Lo ! daies comen , seith the Lord , and Y schal make perfit a newe testament on the hous of Israel , and on the hous of Juda ;
58008009	not lijk the testament that Y made to her fadris , ` in the dai in which Y cauyte her hond , that Y schulde lede hem out of the loond of Egipt ; for thei dwelliden not perfitli in my testament , and Y haue dispisid hem , seith the Lord .
58008010	But this is the testament , which Y schal dispose to the hous of Israel aftir tho daies , seith the Lord , in yyuynge my lawis in to the soulis of hem , and in to the hertis of hem I schal aboue write hem ; and Y schal be to hem in to a God , and they schulen be to me in to a puple .
58008011	And ech man schal not teche his neiyebore , and ech man his brother , seiynge , Knowe thou the Lord ; for alle men schulen knowe me , fro the lesse to the more of hem .
58008012	For Y schal be merciful to the wickidnesse of hem , and now Y schal not bithenke on the synnes of hem .
58008013	But in seiynge a newe , the formere wexide eeld ; and that that is of many daies , and wexith eeld , is nyy the deeth .
58009001	And the former testament hadde iustefiyngis of worschip , and hooli thing duringe for a tyme .
58009002	For the tabernacle was maad first , in which weren candilstikis , and boord , and setting forth of looues , which is seid hooli .
58009003	And after the veil , the secounde tabernacle , that is seid sancta sanctorum , that is , hooli of hooli thingis ;
58009004	hauynge a goldun cenrer , and the arke of the testament , keuered aboute on ech side with gold , in which was a pot of gold hauynge manna , and the yerde of Aaron that florischide , and the tablis of the testament ;
58009005	on whiche thingis weren cherubyns of glorie , ouerschadewinge the propiciatorie ; of whiche thingis it is not now to seie bi alle .
58009006	But whanne these weren maad thus togidere , preestis entriden eueremore in the formere tabernacle , doynge the offices of sacrifices ; but in the secounde tabernacle ,
58009007	the bischop entride onys in the yeer , not without blood , which he offride for his ignoraunce and the puplis .
58009008	For the Hooli Goost signefiede this thing , that not yit the weie of seyntis was openyd , while the formere tabernacle hadde staat .
58009009	Which parable is of this present tyme , bi which also yiftis and sacrifices ben offrid , whiche moun not make a man seruynge perfit bi conscience , oneli in metis ,
58009010	and drynkis , and dyuerse waischingis , and riytwisnessis of fleisch , that weren sett to the tyme of correccioun .
58009011	But Crist beynge a bischop of goodis to comynge , entride bi a largere and perfitere tabernacle , not maad bi hoond , that is to seye ,
58009012	not of this makyng , nether bi blood of goot buckis , or of calues , but bi his owne blood , entride onys in to the hooli thingis , that weren foundun bi an euerlastinge redempcioun .
58009013	For if the blood of gootbuckis , and of boolis , and the aische of a cow calf spreynd , halewith vnclene men to the clensing of fleisch ,
58009014	hou myche more the blood of Crist , which bi the Hooli Goost offride hym silf vnwemmyd to God , schal clense oure conscience fro deed werkis , to serue God that lyueth ?
58009015	And therfor he is a mediatour of the newe testament , that bi deth fallinge bitwixe , in to redempcioun of tho trespassyngis that weren vndur the formere testament , thei that ben clepid take the biheest of euerlastinge eritage .
58009016	For where a testament is , it is nede , that the deth of the testament makere come bitwixe .
58009017	For a testament is confermed in deed men ; ellis it is not worthe , while he lyueth , that made the testament .
58009018	Wherfor nether the firste testament was halewid without blood .
58009019	For whanne ech maundement of the lawe was red of Moises to al the puple , he took the blood of calues , and of buckis of geet , with watir , and reed wolle , and ysope , and bispreynde bothe thilke book and al the puple ,
58009020	and seide , This is the blood of the testament , that God comaundide to you .
58009021	Also he spreynde with blood the tabernacle , and alle the vessels of the seruyce in lijk maner .
58009022	And almest alle thingis ben clensid in blood bi the lawe ; and without scheding of blood remyssioun of synnes is not maad .
58009023	Therfor it is nede , that the saumpleris of heuenli thingis be clensid with these thingis ; but thilke heuenli thingis with betere sacrificis than these .
58009024	For Jhesus entride not in to hooli thingis maad bi hoondis , that ben saumpleris of very thingis , but in to heuene it silf , that he appere now to the cheer of God for vs ; nether that he offre him silf ofte ,
58009025	as the bischop entride in to hooli thingis bi alle yeeris in alien blood ,
58009026	ellis it bihofte hym to suffre ofte fro the bigynnyng of the world ; but now onys in the ending of worldis , to distruccioun of synne bi his sacrifice he apperide .
58009027	And as it is ordeynede to men ,
58009028	onys to die , but aftir this is the dom , so Crist was offrid onys , to auoyde the synnes of many men ; the secounde tyme he schal appere with outen synne to men that abiden him in to heelthe .
58010001	For the lawe hauinge a schadewe of good thingis ` that ben to come , not the ilke image of thingis , mai neuer make men neiyinge perfit bi the ilke same sacrifices , which thei offren without ceessing bi alle yeeris ;
58010002	ellis thei schulden haue ceessid to be offrid , for as myche as the worschiperis clensid onys , hadden not ferthermore conscience of synne .
58010003	But in hem mynde of synnes is maad bi alle yeris .
58010004	For it is impossible that synnes be doon awei bi blood of boolis , and of buckis of geet .
58010005	Therfor he entrynge in to the world , seith , Thou woldist not sacrifice and offryng ; but thou hast schapun a bodi to me ;
58010006	brent sacrificis also for synne plesiden not to thee .
58010007	Thanne Y seide , Lo ! Y come ; in the bigynnyng of the book it is writun of me , that Y do thi wille , God .
58010008	He seiynge bifor , That thou woldist not sacrificis , and offringis , and brent sacrifices for synne , ne tho thingis ben plesaunt to thee , whiche ben offrid bi the lawe ,
58010009	thanne Y seide , Lo ! Y come , that Y do thi wille , God . He doith awei the firste , that he make stidfast the secounde .
58010010	In which wille we ben halewid bi the offring of the bodi of Crist Jhesu onys .
58010011	And ech prest is redi mynystrynge ech dai , and ofte tymes offringe the same sacrifices , whiche moun neuere do awei synnes .
58010012	But this man offringe o sacrifice for synnes , for euere more sittith in the riythalf of God the fadir ;
58010013	fro thennus forth abidinge , til hise enemyes ben put a stool of hise feet .
58010014	For bi oon offring he made perfit for euere halewid men .
58010015	And the Hooli Goost witnessith to vs ; for aftir that he seide , This is the testament ,
58010016	which Y schal witnesse to hem after tho daies , the Lord seith , in yyuynge my lawes in the hertis of hem , and in the soulis of hem Y schal aboue write hem ;
58010017	and now Y schal no more thenke on the synnes and the wickidnessis of hem .
58010018	And where remyssioun of these is , now is ther noon offring for synne .
58010019	Therfor , britheren , hauynge trist in to the entring of hooli thingis in the blood of Crist ,
58010020	which halewide to vs a newe weie , and lyuynge bi the hiling , that is to seie ,
58010021	his fleisch , and we hauynge the greet preest on the hous of God ,
58010022	neiye we with very herte in the plente of feith ; and be oure hertis spreined fro an yuel conscience , and oure bodies waischun with clene watir ,
58010023	and holde we the confessioun of oure hope , bowinge to no side ; for he is trewe that hath made the biheeste .
58010024	And biholde we togidere in the stiring of charite and of good werkis ; not forsakinge oure gadering togidere ,
58010025	as it is of custom to sum men , but coumfortinge , and bi so myche the more , bi hou myche ye seen the dai neiyynge .
58010026	Forwhi now a sacrifice for synnes is not left to vs , that synnen wilfuli , aftir that we han take the knowyng of treuthe .
58010027	Forwhi sum abiding of the dom is dreedful , and the suyng of fier , which schal waste aduersaries .
58010028	Who that brekith Moises lawe , dieth withouten ony merci , bi tweine or thre witnessis ;
58010029	hou myche more gessen ye , that he disserueth worse turmentis , which defouleth the sone of God , and holdith the blood of the testament pollut , in which he is halewid , and doith dispit to the spirit of grace ?
58010030	For we knowen him that seide , To me veniaunce , and Y schal yelde . And eft , For the Lord schal deme his puple .
58010031	It is ferdful to falle in to the hondis of God lyuynge .
58010032	And haue ye mynde on the formere daies , in which ye weren liytned , and suffriden greet strijf of passiouns .
58010033	And in the ` tothir ye weren maad a spectacle bi schenschipis and tribulaciouns ; in an othir ye weren maad felowis of men lyuynge so .
58010034	For also to boundun men ye hadden compassioun , and ye resseyueden with ioye the robbyng of youre goodis , knowinge that ye han a betere and a dwellinge substaunce .
58010035	Therfor nyle ye leese youre trist , which hath greet rewarding .
58010036	For pacience is nedeful to you , that ye do the wille of God , and bringe ayen the biheest .
58010037	For yit a litil , and he that is to comynge schal come , and he schal not tarie .
58010038	For my iust man lyueth of feith ; that if he withdrawith hym silf , he schal not plese to my soule .
58010039	But we ben not the sones of withdrawing awei in to perdicioun , but of feith in to getynge of soule .
58011001	But feith is the substaunce of thingis that ben to be hopid , and an argument of thingis not apperynge .
58011002	And in this feith elde men han gete witnessyng .
58011003	Bi feith we vndurstonden that the worldis weren maad bi Goddis word , that visible thingis weren maad of vnuysible thingis .
58011004	Bi feith Abel offride a myche more sacrifice than Caym to God , bi which he gat witnessyng to be iust , for God bar witnessyng to hise yiftis ; and bi that feith he deed spekith yit .
58011005	Bi feith Ennok was translatid , that he schulde not se deth ; and he was not foundun , for the Lord translatide him . For bifore translacioun he hadde witnessing that he pleside God .
58011006	And it is impossible to plese God without feith . For it bihoueth that a man comynge to God , bileue that he is , and that he is rewardere to men that seken hym .
58011007	Bi feith Noe dredde , thorouy answere takun of these thingis that yit weren not seyn , and schapide a schip in to the helthe of his hous ; bi which he dampnede the world , and is ordeyned eir of riytwisnesse , which is bi feith .
58011008	By feith he that is clepid Abraham , obeiede to go out in to a place , whiche he schulde take in to eritage ; and he wente out , not witinge whidur he schulde go .
58011009	Bi feith he dwelte in the loond of biheest , as in an alien loond , dwellynge in litle housis with Ysaac and Jacob , euene heiris of the same biheest .
58011010	For he abood a citee hauynge foundementis , whos crafti man and maker is God .
58011011	Bi feith also the ilke Sara bareyn , took vertu in consceyuyng of seed , yhe , ayen the tyme of age ; for sche bileuede hym trewe , that hadde bihiyte .
58011012	For which thing of oon , and yit nyy deed , ther ben borun as sterris of heuene in multitude , and as grauel that is at the see side out of noumbre .
58011013	Bi feith alle these ben deed , whanne the biheestis weren not takun , but thei bihelden hem afer , and gretynge hem wel , and knoulechide that thei weren pilgryms , and herboryd men on the erthe .
58011014	And thei that sayn these thingis , signifien that thei sechen a cuntre .
58011015	` If thei hadden hadde mynde of the ilke , of which thei wenten out , thei hadden tyme of turnyng ayen ;
58011016	but now thei desiren a betere , that is to seie , heuenli . Therfor God is not confoundid to be clepid the God of hem ; for he made redi to hem a citee .
58011017	Bi feith Abraham offride Ysaac , whanne he was temptid ; and he offride the oon bigetun , whych had takun the biheestis ;
58011018	to whom it was seid , For in Ysaac the seed schal be clepid to thee .
58011019	For he demyde , that God is myyti to reise hym , yhe , fro deth ; wherfor he took hym also in to a parable .
58011020	Bi feith also of thingis to comynge , Ysaac blesside Jacob and Esau .
58011021	Bi feith Jacob diynge blesside alle the sones of Joseph , and onouride the hiynesse of his yerde .
58011022	Bi feith Joseph dyynge hadde mynde of the passyng forth of the children of Israel , and comaundide of hise boonys .
58011023	Bi feith Moyses borun , was hid thre monethis of his fadir and modir , for that thei seiyen the yonge child fair ; and thei dredden not the maundement of the king .
58011024	Bi feith Moises was maad greet , and denyede that he was the sone of Faraos douytir ,
58011025	and chees more to be turmentid with the puple of God , than to haue myrthe of temporal synne ;
58011026	demynge the repreef of Crist more richessis than the tresours of Egipcians ; for he bihelde in to the rewarding .
58011027	Bi feith he forsook Egipt , and dredde not the hardynesse of the king ; for he abood , as seinge hym that was vnuysible .
58011028	Bi feith he halewide pask , and the scheding out of blood , that he that distriede the firste thingis of Egipcians , schulde not touche hem .
58011029	Bi feith thei passiden the reed see , as bi drye lond , which thing Egipcians asaiynge weren deuourid .
58011030	Bi feith the wallis of Jerico felden doun , bi cumpassyng of seuene daies .
58011031	Bi feith Raab hoor resseyuede the aspieris with pees , and perischide not with vnbileueful men .
58011032	And what yit schal Y seie ? For tyme schal faile to me tellynge of Gedeon , Barak , Sampson , Jepte , Dauid , and Samuel , and of othere prophetis ;
58011033	whiche bi feith ouercamen rewmes , wrouyten riytwisnesse , gaten repromyssiouns ; thei stoppiden the mouthis of liouns ,
58011034	thei quenchiden the feersnesse of fier , thei dryueden awei the egge of swerd , thei coueriden of sijknesse , thei weren maad strong in batel , thei turneden the oostis of aliens .
58011035	Wymmen resseyueden her deed children fro deth to lijf ; but othere weren holdun forth , not takinge redempcioun , that thei schulden fynde a betere ayenrising .
58011036	And othere asaieden scornyngis and betingis , more ouer and boondis and prisouns .
58011037	Thei weren stoned , thei weren sawid , thei weren temptid , thei weren deed in sleyng of swerd . Thei wenten aboute in broc skynnes , and in skynnes of geet , nedi , angwischid , turmentid ;
58011038	to whiche the world was not worthi . Thei erriden in wildernessis , in mounteynes and dennes , and caues of the erthe .
58011039	And alle these , preued bi witnessing of feith , token not repromyssioun ;
58011040	for God purueiede sum betere thing for vs , that thei schulden not be maad perfit with outen vs .
58012001	Therfor we that han so greet a cloude of witnessis put to , do we awei al charge , and synne stondinge aboute vs , and bi pacience renne we to the batel purposid to vs ,
58012002	biholdinge in to the makere of feith , and the perfit endere , Jhesu ; which whanne ioye was purposid to hym , he suffride the cros , and dispiside confusioun , and sittith on the riythalf of the seet of God .
58012003	And bithenke ye on hym that suffride siche ` ayen seiynge of synful men ayens hym silf , that ye be not maad wery , failinge in youre soulis .
58012004	For ye ayenstoden not yit ` til to blood , fiytyng ayens synne .
58012005	And ye han foryet the coumfort that spekith to you as to sones , and seith , My sone , nyle thou dispise the teching of the Lord , nether be thou maad weri , the while thou art chastisid of hym .
58012006	For the Lord chastisith hym that he loueth ; he betith euery sone that he resseyueth .
58012007	Abide ye stille in chastising ; God proferith hym to you as to sones . For what sone is it , whom the fadir chastisith not ?
58012008	That if ye ` ben out of chastising , whos parteneris ben ye alle maad , thanne ye ben auowtreris , and not sones .
58012009	And aftirward we hadden fadris of oure fleisch , techeris , and we with reuerence dredden hem . Whethir not myche more we schulen obeische to the fadir of spiritis , and we schulen lyue ?
58012010	And thei in tyme of fewe dayes tauyten vs bi her wille ; but this fadir techith to that thing that is profitable , in resseyuynge the halewing of hym .
58012011	And ech chastisyng in present tyme semeth to be not of ioye , but of sorewe ; but aftirward it schal yelde fruyt of riytwisnesse moost pesible to men exercisid bi it .
58012012	For whiche thing reise ye slowe hondis ,
58012013	and knees vnboundun , and make ye riytful steppis to youre feet ; that no man haltinge erre , but more be heelid .
58012014	Sue ye pees with alle men , and holynesse , with out which no man schal se God .
58012015	Biholde ye , that no man faile to the grace of God , that no roote of bittirnesse buriownynge vpward lette , and manye ben defoulid bi it ;
58012016	that no man be letchour , ether vnhooli , as Esau , which for o mete seelde hise firste thingis .
58012017	For wite ye , that afterward he coueitinge to enherite blessing , was repreued . For he foond not place of penaunce , thouy he souyte it with teeris .
58012018	But ye han not come to the fier able to be touchid , and able to come to , and to the whirlewynd , and myst , and tempest , and soun of trumpe , and vois of wordis ;
58012019	which thei that herden , excusiden hem , that the word schulde not be maad to hem .
58012020	For thei beren not that that was seid , And if a beeste touchide the hil , it was stonyd .
58012021	And so dredeful it was that was seyn , that Moises seide , Y am a ferd , and ful of trembling .
58012022	But ye han come nyy to the hil Sion , and to the cite of God lyuynge , the heuenli Jerusalem , and to the multitude of many thousynde aungels ,
58012023	and to the chirche of the firste men , whiche ben writun in heuenes , and to God , domesman of alle , and to the spirit of iust perfit men ,
58012024	and to Jhesu , mediatour of the newe testament , and to the sprenging of blood , ` betere spekinge than Abel .
58012025	Se ye , that ye forsake not the spekere ; for if thei that forsaken him that spak on the erthe , aschapide not , myche more we that turnen awei fro him that spekith to vs fro heuenes .
58012026	Whos vois than mouyde the erthe , but now he ayen bihetith , and seith , Yit onys and Y schal moue not oneli erthe , but also heuene .
58012027	And that he seith , Yit onys , he declarith the translacioun of mouable thingis , as of maad thingis , that tho thingis dwelle , that ben vnmouable .
58012028	Therfor we resseyuynge the kingdom vnmouable , haue we grace , bi which serue we plesynge to God with drede and reuerence .
58012029	For oure God is fier that wastith .
58013001	The charite of britherhod dwelle in you , and nyle ye foryete hospitalite ;
58013002	for bi this summen plesiden to aungels , that weren resseyued to herborewe .
58013003	Thenke ye on boundun men , as ye weren togidere boundun , and of trauelinge men , as ye silf dwellinge in the body .
58013004	` Wedding is in alle thingis onourable , and bed vnwemmed ; for God schal deme fornicatouris and auouteris .
58013005	Be youre maneres withoute coueitise , apaied with present thingis ; for he seide , Y schal not leeue thee ,
58013006	nether forsake , so that we seie tristily , The Lord is an helpere to me ; Y schal not drede , what a man schal do to me .
58013007	Haue ye mynde of youre souereyns , that han spokun to you the word of God ; of whiche ` biholde ye the goyng out of lyuynge , and sue ye the feith of hem ,
58013008	Jhesu Crist , yistirdai , and to dai , he is also into worldis .
58013009	Nyle ye be led awei with dyuerse ` techingis , and straunge . For it is best to stable the herte with grace , not with metis , whiche profitiden not to men wandringe in hem .
58013010	We han an auter , of which thei that seruen to the tabernacle , han not power to ete .
58013011	For of whiche beestis the blood is borun in for synne in to hooli thingis bi the bischop , the bodies of hem ben brent with out the castels .
58013012	For which thing Jhesu , that he schulde halewe the puple bi his blood , suffride with out the gate .
58013013	Therfor go we out to hym with out the castels , berynge his repreef .
58013014	For we han not here a citee dwellynge , but we seken a citee to comynge .
58013015	Therfor bi hym offre we a sacrifice of heriyng euere more to God , that is to seye , the fruyt of lippis knoulechinge to his name .
58013016	And nyle ye foryete wel doynge , and comynyng ; for bi siche sacrifices God is disserued .
58013017	Obeie ye to youre souereyns , and be ye suget to hem ; for thei perfitli waken , as to yeldinge resoun for youre soulis , that thei do this thing with ioie , and not sorewinge ; for this thing spedith not to you .
58013018	Preie ye for vs , and we tristen that we han good conscience in alle thingis , willynge to lyue wel .
58013019	More ouer Y biseche you to do , that Y be restorid the sunnere to you .
58013020	And God of pees , that ladde out fro deth the greet scheepherd of scheep , in the blood of euerlastinge testament , oure Lord Jhesu Crist ,
58013021	schape you in al good thing , that ye do the wille of hym ; and he do in you that thing that schal plese bifor hym , bi Jhesu Crist , to whom be glorie in to worldis of worldis . Amen .
58013022	And , britheren , Y preie you , that ye suffre a word of solace ; for bi ful fewe thingis Y haue writun to you .
58013023	Knowe ye oure brother Tymothe , that is sent forth , with whom if he schal come more hastili , Y schal se you .
58013024	Grete ye wel alle youre souereyns , and alle hooli men . The britheren of Italie greten you wel .
58013025	The grace of God be with you alle . Amen .
59001001	James , the seruaunt of God , and of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , to the twelue kinredis , that ben in scatering abrood , helthe .
59001002	My britheren , deme ye al ioye , whanne ye fallen in to diuerse temptaciouns , witynge ,
59001003	that the preuyng of youre feith worchith pacience ;
59001004	and pacience hath a perfit werk , that ye be perfit and hole , and faile in no thing .
59001005	And if ony of you nedith wisdom , axe he of God , which yyueth to alle men largeli , and vpbreidith not ; and it schal be youun to hym .
59001006	But axe he in feith , and doute no thing ; for he that doutith , is lijk to a wawe of the see , which is moued and borun a boute of wynde .
59001007	Therfor gesse not the ilke man , that he schal take ony thing of the Lord .
59001008	A man dowble in soule is vnstable in alle hise weies .
59001009	And a meke brother haue glorie in his enhaunsyng ,
59001010	and a riche man in his lownesse ; for as the flour of gras he schal passe .
59001011	The sunne roos vp with heete , and driede the gras , and the flour of it felde doun , and the fairnesse of his chere perischide ; and so a riche man welewith in hise weies .
59001012	Blessid is the man , that suffrith temptacioun ; for whanne he schal be preued , he schal resseyue the coroun of lijf , which God biheyte to men that louen hym .
59001013	No man whanne he is temptid , seie , that he is temptid of God ; for whi God is not a temptere of yuele thingis , for he temptith no man .
59001014	But ech man is temptid , drawun and stirid of his owne coueiting .
59001015	Aftirward coueityng , whanne it hath conseyued , bringith forth synne ; but synne , whanne it is fillid , gendrith deth .
59001016	Therfor , my most dereworthe britheren , nyle ye erre .
59001017	Ech good yifte , and ech perfit yifte is from aboue , and cometh doun fro the fadir of liytis , anentis whom is noon other chaungyng , ne ouerschadewyng of reward .
59001018	For wilfulli he bigat vs bi the word of treuthe , that we be a bigynnyng of his creature .
59001019	Wite ye , my britheren moost loued , be ech man swift to here , but slow to speke , and slow to wraththe ;
59001020	for the wraththe of man worchith not the riytwisnesse of God .
59001021	For which thing caste ye awei al vnclennesse , and plentee of malice , and in myldenesse resseyue ye the word that is plauntid , that may saue youre soulis .
59001022	But be ye doeris of the word , and not hereris oneli , disseiuynge you silf .
59001023	For if ony man is an herere of the word , and not a doere , this schal be licned to a man that biholdith the cheer of his birthe in a mirour ;
59001024	for he bihelde hym silf , and wente awei , and anoon he foryat which he was .
59001025	But he that biholdith in the lawe of perfit fredom , and dwellith in it , and is not maad a foryetful herere , but a doere of werk , this schal be blessid in his dede .
59001026	And if ony man gessith hym silf to be religiouse , and refreyneth not his tunge , but disseyueth his herte , the religioun of him is veyn .
59001027	A clene religioun , and an vnwemmed anentis God and the fadir , is this , to visite fadirles and modirles children , and widewis in her tribulacioun , and to kepe hym silf vndefoulid fro this world .
59002001	Mi britheren , nyle ye haue the feith of oure Lord Jhesu Crist of glorie , in accepcioun of persoones .
59002002	For if a man ` that hath a goldun ring , and in a feire clothing , cometh in youre cumpany , and a pore man entrith in a foul clothing ,
59002003	and if ye biholden in to hym that is clothid with clere clothing , and if ye seie to hym , Sitte thou here wel ; but to the pore man ye seien , Stonde thou there , ethir sitte vndur the stool of my feet ; whether ye demen not anentis you silf ,
59002004	and ben maad domesmen of wickid thouytis ?
59002005	Heere ye , my moost dereworthe britheren , whethir God chees not pore men in this world , riche in feith , and eiris of the kyngdom , that God bihiyte to men that louen him ?
59002006	But ye han dispisid the pore man . Whether riche men oppressen not you bi power , and thei drawen you to domes ?
59002007	Whether thei blasfemen not the good name , that is clepid to help on you ?
59002008	Netheles if ye performen the kingis lawe , bi scripturis , Thou schalt loue thi neiybour as thi silf , ye don wel .
59002009	But if ye taken persones , ye worchen synne , and ben repreued of the lawe , as trespasseris .
59002010	And who euere kepith al the lawe , but offendith in oon , he is maad gilti of alle .
59002011	For he that seide , Thou schalt do no letcherie , seide also , Thou schalt not sle ; that if thou doist not letcherie , but thou sleest , thou art maad trespassour of the lawe .
59002012	Thus speke ye , and thus do ye , as bigynnynge to be demyd bi the lawe of fredom .
59002013	For whi dom with out merci is to hym , that doith no mercy ; but merci aboue reisith dom .
59002014	Mi britheren , what schal it profite , if ony man seie that he hath feith , but he hath not the werkis ? whether feith schal mowe saue hym ?
59002015	And if a brother ethir sister be nakid , and han nede of ech daies lyuelode ,
59002016	and if ony of you seie to hem , Go ye in pees , be ye maad hoot , and be ye fillid ; but if ye yyuen not to hem tho thingis that ben necessarie to bodi , what schal it profite ?
59002017	So also feith , if it hath not werkis , is deed in it silf .
59002018	But summan schal seie , Thou hast feith , and Y haue werkis ; schewe thou to me thi feith with out werkis , and Y schal schewe to thee my feith of werkis .
59002019	Thou bileuest , that o God is ; thou doist wel ; and deuelis bileuen , and tremblen .
59002020	But wolt thou wite , thou veyn man , that feith with out werkis is idul ?
59002021	Whether Abraham , oure fadir , was not iustified of werkis , offringe Ysaac , his sone , on the auter ?
59002022	Therfor thou seest , that feith wrouyte with hise werkis , and his feith was fillid of werkis .
59002023	And the scripture was fillid , seiynge , Abraham bileuede to God , and it was arettid to hym to riytwisnesse , and he was clepid the freend of God .
59002024	Ye seen that a man is iustified of werkis , and not of feith oneli .
59002025	In lijk maner , and whether also Raab , the hoore , was not iustified of werkis , and resseyuede the messangeris , and sente hem out bi anothir weie ?
59002026	For as the bodi with out spirit is deed , so also feith with out werkis is deed .
59003001	Mi britheren , nyle ye be maad many maistris , witynge that ye taken the more doom .
59003002	For alle we offenden in many thingis . If ony man offendith not in word , this is a perfit man ; for also he may lede aboute al the bodi with a bridil .
59003003	For if we putten bridlis ` in to horsis mouthis , for to consente to vs , and we leden aboute al the bodi of hem .
59003004	And lo ! schippis , whanne thei ben grete , and ben dryuun of stronge wyndis , yit thei ben borun about of a litil gouernaile , where the meuyng of the gouernour wole .
59003005	So also the tunge is but a litil membre , and reisith grete thingis . Lo ! hou litil fier brenneth a ful greet wode .
59003006	And oure tunge is fier , the vniuersite of wickidnesse . The tunge is ordeyned in oure membris , which defoulith al the bodi ; and it is enflawmed of helle , and enflawmeth the wheel of oure birthe .
59003007	And al the kynde of beestis , and of foulis , and of serpentis , and of othere is chastisid , and tho ben maad tame of mannus kinde ; but no man mai chastise the tunge ,
59003008	for it is an vnpesible yuel , and ful of deedli venym .
59003009	In it we blessen God , the fadir , and in it we cursen men , that ben maad to the licnesse of God .
59003010	Of the same mouth passith forth blessing and cursing . My britheren , it bihoueth not that these thingis be don so .
59003011	Whether a welle of the same hoole bringith forth swete and salt watir ?
59003012	My britheren , whether a fige tre may make grapis , ethir a vyne figus ? So nethir salt watir mai make swete watir .
59003013	Who is wijs , and tauyt among you ? schewe he of good lyuyng his worching , in myldenesse of his wisdom .
59003014	That if ye han bitter enuye , and stryuyngis ben in youre hertis , nyle ye haue glorye , and be lyeris ayens the treuthe .
59003015	For this wisdom is not fro aboue comynge doun , but ertheli , and beestli , and feendli .
59003016	For where is enuye and strijf , there is vnstidfastnesse and al schrewid werk .
59003017	But wisdom that is from aboue , first it is chast , aftirward pesible , mylde , able to be counseilid , consentinge to goode thingis , ful of merci and of goode fruytis , demynge with out feynyng .
59003018	And the fruyt of riytwisnesse is sowun in pees , to men that maken pees .
59004001	Wherof ben batelis and cheestis among you ? Whether not of youre coueitisis , that fiyten in youre membris ?
59004002	Ye coueiten , and ye han not ; ye sleen , and ye han enuye , and ye moun not gete . Ye chiden , and maken batel ; and ye han not , for ye axen not .
59004003	Ye axen , and ye resseyuen not ; for that ye axen yuele , as ye schewen opynli in youre coueitisis .
59004004	Auowtreris , witen not ye , that the frenschip of this world is enemye to God ? Therfor who euere wole be frend of this world , is maad the enemye of God .
59004005	Whether ye gessen , that the scripture seith veynli , The spirit that dwellith in you , coueitith to enuye ?
59004006	But he yyueth the more grace ; for which thing he seith , God withstondith proude men , but to meke men he yyueth grace .
59004007	Therfor be ye suget to God ; but withstonde ye the deuel , and he schal fle fro you .
59004008	Neiye ye to God , and he schal neiye to you . Ye synneris , clense ye hondis , and ye double in soule , purge ye the hertis .
59004009	Be ye wretchis , and weile ye ; youre leiyyng be turned in to weping , and ioye in to sorewe of herte .
59004010	Be ye mekid in the siyt of the Lord , and he schal enhaunse you .
59004011	My britheren , nyle ye bacbite ech othere . He that bacbitith his brothir , ethir that demeth his brothir , bacbitith the lawe , and demeth the lawe . And if thou demest the lawe , thou art not a doere of the lawe , but a domesman .
59004012	But oon is makere of the lawe , and iuge , that may lese , and delyuere .
59004013	And who art thou , that demest thi neiybore ? Lo ! now ye , that seien , To dai ethir to morewe we schulen go in to thilke citee , and there we schulen dwelle a yeer , and we schulen make marchaundise , and we schulen make wynning ;
59004014	whiche witen not , what is to you in the morewe .
59004015	For what is youre lijf ? A smoke apperinge at a litil , and aftirward it schal be wastid . Therfor that ye seie , If the Lord wole , and if we liuen , we schulen do this thing , ether that thing .
59004016	And now ye maken ful out ioye in youre pridis ; euery siche ioye is wickyd .
59004017	Therfor it is synne to hym , that kan do good , and doith not .
59005001	Do now , ye riche men , wepe ye , yellinge in youre wretchidnessis that schulen come to you .
59005002	Youre richessis ben rotun , and youre clothis ben etun of mouytis .
59005003	Youre gold and siluer hath rustid , and the rust of hem schal be to you in to witnessyng , and schal ete youre fleischis , as fier . Ye han tresourid to you wraththe in the last daies .
59005004	Lo ! the hire of youre werke men , that repiden youre feeldis , which is fraudid of you , crieth ; and the cry of hem hath entrid in to the eeris of the Lord of oostis .
59005005	Ye han ete on the erthe , and in youre letcheries ye han nurschid youre hertis . In the dai of sleyng ye brouyten ,
59005006	and slowen the iust man , and he ayenstood not you .
59005007	Therfor , britheren , be ye pacient , til to the comyng of the Lord . Lo ! an erthetilier abidith preciouse fruyt of the erthe , paciently suffrynge , til he resseyue ` tymeful and lateful fruyt .
59005008	And be ye pacient , and conferme ye youre hertis , for the comyng of the Lord schal neiye .
59005009	Britheren , nyle ye be sorewful ech to other , that ye be not demed . Lo ! the iuge stondith niy bifor the yate .
59005010	Britheren , take ye ensaumple of yuel goyng out , and of long abidyng , and trauel , and of pacience , the prophetis , that speken to you in the name of the Lord .
59005011	Lo ! we blessen hem that suffriden . Ye herden the ` suffring , ethir pacience , of Joob , and ye sayn the ende of the Lord , for the Lord is merciful , and doynge merci .
59005012	Bifor alle thingis , my britheren , nyle ye swere , nether bi heuene , nether bi erthe , nethir bi what euere other ooth . But be youre word Yhe , yhe , Nay , nay , that ye fallen not vndir doom .
59005013	And if ony of you is sorewful , preye he with pacient soule , and seie he a salm .
59005014	If ony of you is sijk , lede he in preestis of the chirche , and preie thei for hym , and anoynte with oile in the name of the Lord ;
59005015	and the preier of feith schal saue the sijk man , and the Lord schal make hym liyt ; and if he be in synnes , thei schulen be foryouun to hym .
59005016	Therfor knouleche ye ech to othere youre synnes , and preye ye ech for othere , that ye be sauyd . For the contynuel preyer of a iust man is myche worth .
59005017	Elye was a deedli man lijk vs , and in preier he preiede , that it schulde not reyne on the erthe , and it reynede not thre yeeris and sixe monethis .
59005018	And eftsoone he preiede , and heuene yaf reyn , and the erthe yaf his fruyt .
59005019	And , britheren , if ony of you errith fro trewthe , and ony conuertith hym ,
59005020	he owith to wite , that he that makith a synner to be turned fro the errour of his weye , schal saue the soule of hym fro deth , and keuereth the multitude of synnes .
60001001	Petre , apostle of Jhesu Crist , to the chosun men , to the comelingis of scateryng abrood , of Ponte , of Galathie , of Capadosie ,
60001002	of Asye , and of Bitynye , bi the ` bifor knowyng of God , the fadir , in halewyng of spirit , bi obedience , and springyng of the blood of Jhesu Crist , grace and pees be multiplied to you .
60001003	Blessid be God , and the fadir of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , which bi his greet merci bigat vs ayen in to lyuynge hope , bi the ayen risyng of Jhesu Crist fro deth ,
60001004	in to eritage vncorruptible , and vndefoulid , and that schal not fade , that is kept in heuenes for you ,
60001005	that in the vertu of God ben kept bi the feith in to heelthe , and is redi to be schewid in the last tyme .
60001006	In which ye schulen make ioye , thouy it bihoueth now a litil to be sori in dyuerse temptaciouns ;
60001007	that the preuyng of youre feith be myche more preciouse than gold , that is preuyd bi fier ; and be foundun in to heriyng , and glorie , and onour , in the reuelacioun of Jhesu Crist .
60001008	Whom whanne ye han not seyn , ye louen ; in to whom also now ye not seynge , bileuen ; but ye that bileuen schulen haue ioye , and gladnesse that may not be teld out ,
60001009	and ye schulen be glorified , and haue the ende of youre feith , the helthe of youre soulis .
60001010	Of which helthe profetis souyten , and enserchiden , that profecieden of the grace to comyng in you ,
60001011	and souyten which euer what maner tyme the spirit of Crist signyfiede in hem , and bifor telde tho passiouns , that ben in Crist , and the latere glories .
60001012	To which it was schewid , for not to hem silf , but to you thei mynystriden tho thingis , that now ben teld to you bi hem that prechiden to you bi the Hooli Goost sent fro heuene , in to whom aungelis desiren to biholde .
60001013	For which thing be ye gird the leendis of youre soule , sobre , perfit , and hope ye in to the ilke grace that is profrid to you bi the schewyng of Jhesu Crist ,
60001014	as sones of obedience , not made lijk to the formere desiris of youre vnkunnyngnesse ,
60001015	but lijk him that hath ` clepid you hooli ; that also ` ye silf be hooli in ` al lyuyng ;
60001016	for it is writun , Ye schulen be hooli , for Y am hooli .
60001017	And if ye inwardli clepe him fadir , which demeth withouten accepcioun of persoones bi the werk of ech man , lyue ye in drede in the time of youre pilgrimage ; witynge that not bi corruptible gold ,
60001018	ethir siluer , ye ben bouyt ayen of youre veyn liuynge of fadris tradicioun ,
60001019	but bi the precious blood as of the lomb vndefoulid and vnspottid ,
60001020	Crist Jhesu , that was knowun bifor the makyng of the world , but he is schewid in the laste tymes ,
60001021	for you that bi hym ben feithful in God ; that reiside hym fro deth , and yaf to hym euerlastynge glorie , that youre feith and hope were in God .
60001022	And make ye chast youre soulis in obedience of charite , in loue of britherhod ; of simple herte loue ye togidre more bisili .
60001023	And be ye borun ayen , not of corruptible seed , ` but vncorruptible , bi the word of lyuynge God , and dwellynge in to with outen ende .
60001024	For ech fleisch is hey , and al the glorie of it is as flour of hey ; the hei driede vp , and his flour felde doun ;
60001025	but the word of the Lord dwellith with outen ende . And this is the word , that is prechid to you .
60002001	Therfor putte ye awei al malice , and al gile , and feynyngis , and enuyes , and alle bacbityngis ;
60002002	as now borun yonge children , resonable , with out gile , coueite ye mylk , that in it ye wexe in to helthe ; if netheles ye han tastid ,
60002003	that the Lord is swete .
60002004	And neiye ye to hym , that is a lyuyng stoon , and repreuyd of men , but chosun of God , and onourid ;
60002005	and ye silf as quyk stoonys be ye aboue bildid in to spiritual housis , and an hooli preesthod , to offre spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God bi Jhesu Crist .
60002006	For which thing the scripture seith , Lo ! Y schal sette in Syon the hiyeste corner stoon , chosun and preciouse ; and he that schal belieue in hym , schal not be confoundid .
60002007	Therfor onour to you that bileuen ; but to men that bileuen not , the stoon whom the bilderis repreuyden , this is maad in to the heed of the corner ; and the stoon of hirtyng ,
60002008	and stoon of sclaundre , to hem that offenden to the word , nethir bileuen it , in which thei ben set .
60002009	But ye ben a chosun kyn , a kyngli preesthod , hooli folc , a puple of purchasing , that ye telle the vertues of hym , that clepide you fro derknessis in to his wondirful liyt .
60002010	Which sum tyme were not a puple of God , but now ye ben the puple of God ; which hadden not merci , but now ye han merci .
60002011	Moost dere , Y biseche you , as comelyngis and pilgrymys , to absteine you fro fleischli desiris , that fiyten ayens the soule ;
60002012	and haue ye youre conuersacioun good among hethene men , that in that thing that thei bacbite of you , as of mysdoeris , thei biholden you of good werkis , and glorifie God in the dai of visitacioun .
60002013	Be ye suget to ech creature , for God ; ethir to the kyng , as to hym that is hiyer in state ,
60002014	ethir to duykis , as to thilke that ben sent of hym to the veniaunce of mysdoers , and to the preisyng of good men .
60002015	For so is the wille of God , that ye do wel , and make the vnkunnyngnesse of vnprudent men to be doumb .
60002016	As fre men , and not as hauynge fredom the keuering of malice , but as the seruauntis of God .
60002017	Onoure ye alle men , loue ye brithirhod , drede ye God , onoure ye the king .
60002018	Seruauntis , be ye sugetis in al drede to lordis , not oneli to good and to mylde , but also to tyrauntis .
60002019	For this is grace , if for conscience of God ony man suffrith heuynessis , and suffrith vniustli .
60002020	For what grace is it , if ye synnen , and ben buffatid , and suffren ? But if ye don wel , and suffren pacientli , this is grace anentis God .
60002021	For to this thing ye ben clepid . For also Crist suffride for vs , and lefte ensaumple to you , that ye folewe the steppis of hym .
60002022	Which dide not synne , nethir gile was foundun in his mouth .
60002023	And whanne he was cursid , he curside not ; whanne he suffride , he manasside not ; but he bitook hym silf to hym , that demyde hym vniustli .
60002024	And he hym silf bar oure synnes in his bodi on a tre , that we be deed to synnes , and lyue to riytwisnesse , bi whos wan wounde ye ben heelid .
60002025	For ye weren as scheep errynge , but ye ben now turned to the schipherde , and bischop of youre soulis .
60003001	Also wymmen be thei suget to her hosebondis ; that if ony man bileue not to the word , bi the conuersacioun of wymmen thei be wonnun with out word .
60003002	And biholde ye in drede youre hooli conuersacioun .
60003003	Of whiche ` ther be not with outforth curious ournyng of heer , ether doyng aboute of gold , ethir ournyng of clothing ;
60003004	but thilke that is the hid man of herte , in vncorrupcioun , and of mylde spirit , which is riche in the siyt of God .
60003005	For so sumtyme hooli wymmen hopinge in God ourneden hem silf , and weren suget to her owne hosebondis .
60003006	As Sara obeied to Abraham , and clepide hym lord ; of whom ye ben douytris wel doynge , and not dredynge ony perturbacioun .
60003007	Also men dwelle togidre , and bi kunnyng yyue ye onoure to the wommanus freeltee , as to the more feble , and as to euen eiris of grace and of lijf , that youre preieris be not lettid .
60003008	And in feith alle of oon wille in preier be ye eche suffringe with othere , loueris of britherhod , merciful , mylde , meke ;
60003009	not yeldinge yuel for yuel , nether cursing for cursing , but ayenward blessinge ; for in this thing ye ben clepid , that ye welde blessinge bi eritage .
60003010	For he that wole loue lijf , and se goode daies , constreyne his tunge from yuel , and hise lippis , that thei speke not gile .
60003011	And bowe he from yuel , and do good ; seke he pees , and perfitli sue it .
60003012	For the iyen of the Lord ben on iust men , and hise eris on the preieris of hem ; but the cheer of the Lord is on men that don yuels .
60003013	And who is it that schal anoye you , if ye ben sueris and louyeris of goodnesse ?
60003014	But also if ye suffren ony thing for riytwisnesse , ye ben blessid ; but drede ye not the drede of hem , that ye be not disturblid .
60003015	But halewe ye the Lord Crist in youre hertis , and euermore be ye redi to satisfaccioun to ech man axynge you resoun of that feith and hope that is in you ,
60003016	but with myldenesse and drede , hauynge good conscience ; that in that thing that thei bacbiten of you , thei ben confoundid , whiche chalengen falsly youre good conuersacioun in Crist .
60003017	For it is betere that ye do wel , and suffre , if the wille of God wole , than doynge yuele .
60003018	For also Crist onys diede for oure synnes , he iust for vniust , that he schulde offre to God vs , maad deed in fleisch , but maad quik in spirit .
60003019	For which thing he cam in spirit , and also to hem that weren closid togidre in prisoun prechide ;
60003020	whiche weren sum tyme vnbileueful , whanne thei abididen the pacience of God in the daies of Noe , whanne the schip was maad , in which a few , that is to seie , eiyte soulis weren maad saaf bi water .
60003021	And so baptym of lijk forme makith vs saaf ; not the puttyng awei of the filthis of fleisch , but the axyng of a good conscience in God , bi the ayenrysyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , that is in the riyt half of God ,
60003022	and swolewith deth , that we schulden be made eiris of euerlastinge lijf . He yede in to heuene , and aungelis , and powers , and vertues , ben maad sugetis to hym .
60004001	Therfor for Crist suffride in fleisch , be ye also armed bi the same thenkynge ; for he that suffride in fleisch ceesside fro synnes ,
60004002	that that is left now in fleisch lyue not now to the desiris of men , but to the wille of God .
60004003	For the time that is passid is ynow to the wille of hethene men to be endid , whiche walkiden in letcheries , and lustis , in myche drinking of wyn , in vnmesurable etyngis , and drynkyngis , and vnleueful worschiping of mawmetis .
60004004	In whiche now thei ben astonyed , in which thing thei wondren , for ye rennen not togidere ` in to the same confusioun of letcherie , and blasfemen .
60004005	And thei schulen yyue resoun to hym , that is redi to deme the quyke and the deed .
60004006	For whi for this thing it is prechid also to deed men , that thei be demed bi men in fleisch , and that thei lyue bi God in spirit .
60004007	For the ende of alle thingis schal neiye . Therfor be ye prudent , and wake ye in preyeris ;
60004008	bifore alle thingis haue ye charite ech to other in you silf algatis lastynge ; for charite couerith the multitude of synnes .
60004009	Holde ye hospitalite togidere with out grutching ;
60004010	ech man as he hath resseyued grace , mynystringe it in to ech othere , as good dispenderis of the manyfold grace of God .
60004011	If ony man spekith , speke he as the wordis of God ; if ony man mynystrith , as of the vertu which God mynystrith ; that God be onourid in alle thingis bi Jhesu Crist oure Lord , to whom is glorie and lordschip in to worldis ` of worldis .
60004012	Amen . Moost dere brytheren , nyle ye go in pilgrymage in feruour , that is maad to you to temptacioun , as if ony newe thing bifalle to you ;
60004013	but comyne ye with the passiouns of Crist , and haue ye ioye , that also ye be glad , and haue ioye in the reuelacioun of his glorie .
60004014	If ye ben dispisid for the name of Crist , ye schulen be blessid ; for that that is of the onour , and of the glorie , and of the vertu of God , and the spirit that is his , schal reste on you .
60004015	But no man of you suffre as a mansleere , ethir a theef , ether cursere , ethir a disirere of othere mennus goodis ;
60004016	but if as a cristen man , schame he not , but glorifie he God in this name .
60004017	For tyme is , that doom bigynne at Goddis hous ; and if it bigynne first at vs , what ende schal be of hem , that bileuen not to the gospel ?
60004018	And if a iust man vnnethe schal be sauid , where schulen the vnfeithful man and the synnere appere ?
60004019	Therfor and thei that suffren bi the wille of God , bitaken her soulis in good dedis to the feithful makere of nouyt .
60005001	Therfor Y , an euene eldre man , and a witnesse of Cristis passiouns , which also am a comynere of that glorie , that schal be schewid in tyme to comynge ; byseche ye the eldre men ,
60005002	that ben among you , fede ye the flok of God , that is among you , and puruey ye , not as constreyned , but wilfulli , bi God ; not for loue of foule wynnyng ,
60005003	but wilfulli , nether as hauynge lordschip in the clergie , but that ye ben maad ensaumple of the floc , of wille .
60005004	And whanne the prince of scheepherdis schal appere , ye schulen resseyue the coroun of glorie , that may neuere fade .
60005005	Also , ye yonge men , be ye suget to eldre men , and alle schewe ye togidere mekenesse ; for the Lord withstondith proude men , but he yyueth grace to meke men .
60005006	Therfor be ye mekid vndir the myyti hoond of God , that he reise you in the tyme of visitacioun ,
60005007	and caste ye al youre bisynesse in to hym , for to hym is cure of you .
60005008	Be ye sobre , and wake ye , for youre aduersarie , the deuel , as a rorynge lioun goith aboute , sechinge whom he schal deuoure .
60005009	Whom ayenstonde ye , stronge in the feith , witynge that the same passioun is maad to thilke brithirhode of you , that is in the world .
60005010	And God of al grace , that clepide you in to his euerlastinge glorie , you suffrynge a litil , he schal performe , and schal conferme , and schal make sad .
60005011	To hym be glorie and lordschip , in to worldis of worldis . Amen .
60005012	Bi Siluan , feithful brother to you as Y deme , Y wroot schortli ; bisechinge , and witnessinge that this is the very grace of God , in which ye stonden .
60005013	The chirche that is gaderid in Babiloyne , and Marcus , my sone , gretith you wel .
60005014	Grete ye wel togidere in hooli cos . Grace be to you alle that ben in Crist . Amen .
61001001	Simount Petre , seruaunt and apostle of ` Jhesu Crist , to hem that han take with vs the euene feith , in the riytwisnesse of oure God and sauyour Jhesu Crist ,
61001002	grace and pees be fillid to you , bi the knowing of oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
61001003	Hou alle thingis of his godlich vertu , that ben to lijf and pitee , ben youun to vs , bi the knowyng of hym , that clepide vs for his owne glorie and vertu .
61001004	Bi whom he yaf to vs moost preciouse biheestis ; that bi these thingis ye schulen be maad felows of Goddis kynde , and fle the corrupcioun of that coueytise , that is in the world .
61001005	And bringe ye in alle bisynesse , and mynystre ye in youre feith vertu , and ` in vertu kunnyng ;
61001006	in kunnyng abstinence , in abstynence pacience , in pacience pitee ;
61001007	in pitee , love of britherhod , and in loue of britherhod charite .
61001008	For if these ben with you , and ouercomen , thei schulen not make you voide , nethir with out fruyt , in the knowyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
61001009	But to whom these ben not redi , he is blynd , and gropith with his hoond , and foryetith the purgyng of his elde trespassis .
61001010	Wherfor , britheren , be ye more bisi , that by goode werkis ye make youre clepyng and chesyng certeyn ;
61001011	for ye doynge these thingis schulen not do synne ony tyme . For thus the entryng in to euerlastynge kyngdom of oure Lord and sauyour Jhesu Crist , schal be mynystrid to you plenteuousli .
61001012	For which thing Y schal bigynne to moneste you euere more of these thingis ; and Y wole that ye be kunnynge , and confermyd in this present treuthe .
61001013	Forsothe Y deme iustli , as long as Y am in this tabernacle , to reise you in monesting ; and Y am certeyn ,
61001014	that the putting awei of my tabernacle is swift , bi this that oure Lord Jhesu Crist hath schewid to me .
61001015	But Y schal yyue bisynesse , and ofte after my deth ye haue mynde of these thingis .
61001016	For we not suynge vnwise talis , han maad knowun to you the vertu and the biforknowyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist ; but we weren maad biholderis of his greetnesse .
61001017	For he took of God the fadir onour and glorie , bi siche maner vois slidun doun to hym fro the greet glorie , This is my loued sone , in whom Y haue plesid to me ; here ye hym .
61001018	And we herden this vois brouyt from heuene , whanne we weren with hym in the hooli hil .
61001019	And we han a saddere word of prophecie , to which ye yyuynge tent don wel , as to a lanterne that yyueth liyt in a derk place , til the dai bigynne to yyue liyt , and the dai sterre sprenge in youre hertis .
61001020	And firste vndurstonde ye this thing , that ech prophesie of scripture is not maad bi propre interpretacioun ;
61001021	for prophesie was not brouyt ony tyme bi mannus wille , but the hooli men of God inspirid with the Hooli Goost spaken .
61002001	But also false prophetis weren in the puple , as in you schulen be maistris lieris , that schulen bringe in sectis of perdicioun ; and thei denyen thilke Lord that bouyte hem , and bringen on hem silf hasti perdicioun .
61002002	And many schulen sue her letcheries , bi whiche the weie of treuthe schal be blasfemyd ;
61002003	and thei schulen make marchaundie of you in coueytise bi feyned wordis . To whiche doom now a while ago ceessith not , and the perdicioun of hem nappith not .
61002004	For if God sparide not aungels synnynge , but bitook hem to be turmentid , and to be drawun doun with boondis of helle in to helle , to be kept in to dom ;
61002005	and sparide not the firste world , but kept Noe , the eiythe man , the biforgoere of riytwisnesse , and brouyte in the greet flood to the world of vnfeithful men ;
61002006	and he droof in to poudre the citees of men of Sodom and of men of Gommor , and dampnede bi turnyng vpsedoun , and putte hem the ensaumple of hem that weren to doynge yuele ;
61002007	and delyuerid the iust Loth , oppressid of the wrong , and of the letcherouse conuersacioun of cursid men ;
61002008	for in siyt and hering he was iust , and dwellide amongst hem that fro dai in to dai turmentiden with wickid werkis a iust soule .
61002009	For the Lord kan delyuere piteuouse men fro temptacioun , and kepe wickid men ` in to the dai of dom to be turmentid ;
61002010	but more hem that walken aftir the fleisch , in coueytinge of vnclennesse , and dispisen lordschiping , and ben boold , plesynge hem silf , and dreden not to bringe in sectis , blasfemynge ; where aungels ,
61002011	whanne thei ben more in strengthe and vertu , beren not ` that was the execrable doom ayens hem .
61002012	But these ben as vnresonable beestis , kyndli in to takyng , and in to deth , blasfemynge in these thingis that thei knowen not , and schulen perische in her corrupcioun ,
61002013	and resseyue the hire of vnriytwisnesse . And thei gessen delicis of defouling and of wemme , to be likyngis of dai , flowynge in her feestis with delicis , doynge letcherie with you ,
61002014	and han iyen ful of auowtrie , and vnceessynge trespas , disseyuynge vnstidfast soulis , and han the herte excercisid to coueitise ; the sones of cursyng ,
61002015	that forsaken the riyt weie , and erriden , suynge the weie of Balaam of Bosor , which louyde the hire of wickidnesse .
61002016	But he hadde repreuyng of his woodnesse ; a doumb beest vndur yok , that spak with vois of man , that forbede the vnwisdom of the profete .
61002017	These ben wellis with out watir , and mystis dryuun with ` whirlinge wyndys , to whiche the thicke mijst of derknessis is reseruyd .
61002018	And thei speken in pryde of vanyte , and disseyuen in desiris of fleisch of letcherie hem , that scapen a litil .
61002019	Whiche lyuen in errour , and biheten fredom to hem , whanne thei ben seruauntis of corrupcioun . For of whom ony man is ouercomun , of hym also he is seruaunt .
61002020	For if men forsaken the vnclennessis of the world , bi the knowyng of oure Lord and sauyour Jhesu Crist , and eftsone ben wlappid in these , and ben ouercomun , the lattere thingis ben maad to hem worse than the formere .
61002021	For it was betere to hem to not knowe the weie of riytwisnesse , than to turne ayen aftir the knowyng , fro that hooli maundement that was bitakun to hem .
61002022	For thilke very prouerb bifelde to hem , The hound turnede ayen to his castyng , and a sowe is waischun in walwyng in fenne .
61003001	Lo ! ye moost dereworth britheren , Y write to you this secounde epistle , in which Y stire youre clere soule bi monesting togidere ,
61003002	that ye be myndeful of tho wordis , that Y biforseide of the hooli prophetis , and of the maundementis of the hooli apostlis of the Lord and sauyour .
61003003	First wite ye this thing , that in the laste daies disseyueris schulen come in disseit , goynge aftir her owne coueityngis ,
61003004	seiynge , Where is the biheest , or the comyng of hym ? for sithen the fadris dieden , alle thingis lasten fro the bigynnyng of creature .
61003005	But it is hid fro hem willynge this thing , that heuenes were bifore , and the erthe of water was stondynge bi watir , of Goddis word ;
61003006	bi which that ilke world clensid , thanne bi watir perischide .
61003007	But the heuenes that now ben , and the erthe , ben kept bi the same word , and ben reseruyd to fier in to the dai of doom and perdicioun of wickid men .
61003008	But , ye moost dere , this o thing be not hid to you , that o dai anentis God is as a thousynde yeeris , and a thousynde yeeris ben as o dai .
61003009	The Lord tarieth not his biheest , as summe gessen , but he doith pacientli for you , and wole not that ony men perische , but that alle turne ayen to penaunce .
61003010	For the dai of the Lord schal come as a theef , in which heuenes with greet bire schulen passe , and elementis schulen be dissoluyd bi heete , and the erthe , and alle the werkis that ben in it , schulen be brent .
61003011	Therfor whanne alle these thingis schulen be dissolued , what manner men bihoueth it you to be in hooli lyuyngis and pitees ,
61003012	abidinge and hiyynge in to the comyng of the dai of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , bi whom heuenes brennynge schulen be dissoluyd , and elementis schulen faile bi brennyng of fier .
61003013	Also we abiden bi hise biheestis newe heuenes and newe erthe , in which riytwisnesse dwellith .
61003014	For which thing , ye moost dere , abidynge these thingis , be ye bisye to be foundun to hym in pees vnspottid and vndefoulid .
61003015	And deme ye long abiding of oure Lord Jhesu Crist youre heelthe , as also oure moost dere brother Poul wroot to you , bi wisdom youun to hym .
61003016	As and in alle epistlis he spekith ` in hem of these thingis ; in which ben summe hard thingis to vndurstonde , whiche vnwise and vnstable men deprauen , as also thei don othere scripturis , to her owne perdicioun .
61003017	Therfor ye , britheren , bifor witynge kepe you silf , lest ye be disseyued bi errour of vnwise men , and falle awei fro youre owne sadnesse .
61003018	But wexe ye in the grace and the knowyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist and oure Sauyour ; to hym be glorie now and in to the dai of euerlastyngnesse . Amen .
62001001	That thing that was fro the bigynnyng , which we herden , which we sayn with oure iyen , which we bihelden , and oure hondis touchiden , of the word of lijf ; and the lijf is schewid .
62001002	And we sayn , and we witnessen , and tellen to you the euerlastynge lijf , that was anentis the fadir , and apperide to vs .
62001003	Therfor ` we tellen to you that thing , that we seyn , and herden , that also ye haue felowschipe with vs , and oure felowschip be with the fadir , and with his sone Jhesu Crist .
62001004	And we writen this thing to you , that ye haue ioye , and that youre ioye be ful .
62001005	And this is the tellyng , that we herden of hym , and tellen to you , that God is liyt , and ther ben no derknessis in him .
62001006	If we seien , that we han felawschip with hym , and we wandren in derknessis , we lien , and don not treuthe .
62001007	But if we walken in liyt , as also he is in liyt , we han felawschip togidere ; and the blood of Jhesu Crist , his sone , clensith vs fro al synne .
62001008	If we seien , that we han no synne , we disseyuen vs silf , and treuthe is not in vs .
62001009	If we knowlechen oure synnes , he is feithful and iust , that he foryyue to vs oure synnes , and clense vs from al wickidnesse .
62001010	And if we seien , we han not synned , we maken hym a liere , and his word is not in vs .
62002001	Mi litle sones , Y write to you these thingis , that ye synnen not . But if ony man synneth , we han an aduocat anentis the fadir ,
62002002	Jhesu Crist , and he is the foryyuenes for oure synnes ; and not oneli for oure synnes , but also for the synnes of al the world .
62002003	And in this thing we witen , that we knowen hym , if we kepen hise comaundementis .
62002004	He that seith that he knowith God , and kepith not hise comaundementis , is a liere , and trewthe is not in hym .
62002005	But the charite of God is perfit verili in hym , that kepith his word . In this thing we witen , that we ben in hym , if we ben perfit in hym .
62002006	He that seith , that he dwellith in hym , he owith for to walke , as he walkide .
62002007	Moost dere britheren , Y write to you , not a newe maundement , but the elde maundement , that ye hadden fro the bigynnyng . The elde maundement is the word , that ye herden .
62002008	Eftsoone Y write to you a newe maundement , that is trewe bothe in hym and in you ; for derknessis ben passid , and veri liyt schyneth now .
62002009	He that seith , that he is in liyt , and hatith his brother , is in derknesse yit .
62002010	He that loueth his brothir , dwellith in liyt , and sclaundre is not in hym .
62002011	But he that hatith his brother , is in derknessis , and wandrith in derknessis , and woot not whidir he goith ; for derknessis han blindid hise iyen .
62002012	Litle sones , Y write to you , that youre synnes ben foryouun to you for his name .
62002013	Fadris , Y write to you , for ye han knowun hym , that is fro the bigynnyng . Yonge men , Y write to you , for ye han ouercomun the wickid .
62002014	Y write to you , yonge children , for ye han knowe the fadir . Y write to you , britheren , for ye han knowen hym , that is fro the bigynnyng . Y write to you , yonge men , for ye ben stronge , and the word of God dwellith in you , and ye han ouercomun the wickid .
62002015	Nyle ye loue the world , ne tho thingis that ben in the world . If ony man loueth the world , the charite of the fader is not in hym .
62002016	For al thing that is in the world , is coueitise of fleisch , and coueitise of iyen , and pride of lijf , which is not of the fadir , but it is of the world .
62002017	And the world schal passe , and the coueitise of it ; but he that doith the wille of God , dwellith with outen ende .
62002018	My litle sones , the laste our is ; and as ye han herd , that antecrist cometh , now many antecristis ben maad ; wherfor we witen , that it is the laste our .
62002019	Thei wenten forth fro vs , but thei weren not of vs ; for if thei hadden be of vs , thei hadden dwelte with vs ; but that thei be knowun , that thei ben not of vs .
62002020	But ye han anointyng of the Hooli Goost , and knowen alle thingis .
62002021	Y wroot not to you , as to men that knowen not treuthe , but as to men that knowen it , and for ech leesing is not of treuthe .
62002022	Who is a liere , but this that denyeth that Jhesu is not Crist ? This is antecrist , that denyeth the fadir , and the sone .
62002023	So ech that denyeth the sone , hath not the fadir ; but he that knowlechith the sone , hath also the fadir .
62002024	That thing that ye herden at the bigynnyng , dwelle it in you ; for if that thing dwellith in you , which ye herden at the bigynnyng , ye schulen dwelle in the sone and in the fadir .
62002025	And this is the biheeste , that he bihiyte to vs euerlastinge lijf .
62002026	Y wroot these thingis to you , of hem that disseyuen you ,
62002027	and that the anoyntyng which ye resseyueden of hym , dwelle in you . And ye han not nede , that ony man teche you , but as his anoyntyng techith you of alle thingis , and it is trewe , and it is not leesyng ; and as he tauyte you , dwelle ye in hym .
62002028	And now , ye litle sones , dwelle ye in hym , that whanne he schal appere , we haue a trist , and be not confoundid of hym in his comyng .
62002029	If ye witen that he is iust , wite ye that also ech that doith riytwisnesse , is borun of hym .
62003001	Se ye what maner charite the fadir yaf to vs , that we be named the sones of God , and ben hise sones . For this thing the world knewe not vs , for it knew not hym .
62003002	Moost dere britheren , now we ben the sones of God , and yit it apperide not , what we schulen be . We witen , that whanne he schal appere , we schulen be lijk hym , for we schulen se hym as he is .
62003003	And ech man that hath this hope in hym , makith hym silf hooli , as he is hooli .
62003004	Ech man that doith synne , doith also wickidnesse , and synne is wickidnesse .
62003005	And ye witen , that he apperide to do awei synnes , and synne is not in hym .
62003006	Ech man that dwellith in hym , synneth not ; and ech that synneth , seeth not hym , nether knew hym .
62003007	Litle sones , no man disseyue you ; he that doith riytwysnesse , is iust , as also he is iust .
62003008	He that doith synne , is of the deuel ; for the deuel synneth fro the bigynnyng . In this thing the sone of God apperide , that he vndo the werkis of the deuel .
62003009	Ech man that is borun of God , doith not synne ; for the seed of God dwellith in hym , and he may not do synne , for he is borun of God .
62003010	In this thing the sones of God ben knowun , and the sones of the feend . Ech man that is not iust , is not of God , and he that loueth not his brothir .
62003011	For this is the tellyng , that ye herden at the bigynnyng , that ye loue ech othere ;
62003012	not as Caym , that was of the yuele , and slouy his brother . And for what thing slouy he him ? for hise werkis weren yuele , and hise brotheris iust .
62003013	Britheren , nyle ye wondre , if the world hatith you .
62003014	We witen , that we ben translatid fro deeth to lijf , for we louen britheren . He that loueth not , dwellith in deth .
62003015	Ech man that hatith his brother , is a man sleere ; and ye witen , that ech mansleere hath not euerlastinge lijf dwellinge in hym .
62003016	In this thing we han knowe the charite of God , for he puttide his lijf for vs , and we owen to putte oure lyues for oure britheren .
62003017	He that hath the catel of this world , and seeth that his brothir hath nede , and closith his entrailis fro hym , hou dwellith the charite of God in hym ?
62003018	Mi litle sones , loue we not in word , nethir in tunge , but in werk and treuthe .
62003019	In this thing we knowen , that we ben of treuthe , and in his siyt we monesten oure hertis .
62003020	For if oure herte repreueth vs , God is more than oure hert , and knowith alle thingis .
62003021	Moost dere britheren , if oure herte repreueth not vs , we han trust to God ;
62003022	and what euer we schulen axe , we schulen resseyue of hym , for we kepen hise comaundementis , and we don tho thingis that ben plesaunt bifor hym .
62003023	And this is the comaundement of God , that we bileue in the name of his sone Jhesu Crist , and that we loue ech othere , as he yaf heeste to vs .
62003024	And he that kepith hise comaundementis , dwellith in hym , and he in hym . And in this thing we witen , that he dwellith in vs , bi the spirit , whom he yaf to vs .
62004001	Moost dere britheren , nyle ye bileue to ech spirit , but preue ye spiritis , if thei ben of God ; for many false prophetis wenten out in to the world .
62004002	In this thing the spirit of God is knowun ; ech spirit that knowlechith that Jhesu Crist hath come in fleisch , is of God ;
62004003	and ech spirit that fordoith Jhesu , is not of God . And this is antecrist , of whom ye herden , that he cometh ; and riyt now he is in the world .
62004004	Ye , litle sones , ben of God , and ye han ouercome hym ; for he that is in you is more , than he that is in the world .
62004005	Thei ben of the world , therfor thei speken of the world , and the world herith hem .
62004006	We ben of God ; he that knowith God , herith vs ; he that is not of God , herith not vs . In this thing we knowen the spirit of treuthe , and the spirit of errour .
62004007	Moost dere britheren , loue we togidere , for charite is of God ; and ech that loueth his brother , is borun of God , and knowith God .
62004008	He that loueth not , knowith not God ; for God is charite .
62004009	In this thing the charite of God apperide in vs , for God sente hise oon bigetun sone in to the world , that we lyue bi hym .
62004010	In this thing is charite , not as we hadden loued God , but for he firste louede vs , and sente hise sone foryyuenesse for oure synnes .
62004011	Ye moost dere britheren , if God louede vs , we owen to loue ech other .
62004012	No man say euer God ; if we louen togidre , God dwellith in vs , and the charite of hym is perfit in vs .
62004013	In this thing we knowen , that we dwellen in hym , and he in vs ; for of his spirit he yaf to vs .
62004014	And we sayen , and witnessen , that the fadir sente his sone sauyour of the world .
62004015	Who euer knowlechith , that Jhesu is the sone of God , God dwellith in him , and he in God .
62004016	And we han knowun , and bileuen to the charite , that God hath in vs . God is charite , and he that dwellith in charite , dwellith in God , and God in hym .
62004017	In this thing is the perfit charite of God with vs , that we haue trist in the dai of dom ; for as he is , also we ben in this world .
62004018	Drede is not in charite , but perfit charite puttith out drede ; for drede hath peyne . But he that dredith , is not perfit in charite .
62004019	Therfor loue we God , for he louede vs bifore .
62004020	If ony man seith , that ` Y loue God , and hatith his brother , he is a liere . For he that loueth not his brothir , which he seeth , hou mai he loue God , whom he seeth not ?
62004021	And we han this comaundement of God , that he that loueth God , loue also his brothir .
62005001	Ech man that bileueth that Jhesus is Crist , is borun of God ; and ech man that loueth hym that gendride , loueth hym that is borun of hym .
62005002	In this thing we knowen , that we louen the children of God , whanne we louen God , and don his maundementis .
62005003	For this is the charite of God , that we kepe hise maundementis ; and his maundementis ben not heuy .
62005004	For al thing that is borun of God , ouercometh the world ; and this is the victorie that ouercometh the world , oure feith .
62005005	And who is he that ouercometh the world , but he that bileueth that Jhesus is the sone of God ?
62005006	This is Jhesus Crist , that cam bi watir and blood ; not in water oonli , but in watir and blood . And the spirit is he that witnessith , that Crist is treuthe .
62005007	For thre ben , that yyuen witnessing in heuene , the Fadir , the Sone , and the Hooli Goost ; and these thre ben oon .
62005008	` And thre ben , that yyuen witnessing in erthe , the spirit , water , and blood ; and these thre ben oon .
62005009	If we resseyuen the witnessing of men , the witnessing of God is more ; for this is the witnessing of God , that is more , for he witnesside of his sone .
62005010	He that bileueth in the sone of God , hath the witnessing of God in hym . He that bileueth not to the sone , makith hym a liere ; for he bileueth not in the witnessing , that God witnesside of his sone .
62005011	And this is the witnessyng , for God yaf to you euerlastinge lijf , and this lijf is in his sone .
62005012	He that hath the sone of God , hath also lijf ; he that hath not the sone of God , hath not lijf .
62005013	I write to you these thingis , that ye wite , that ye han euerlastynge lijf , which bileuen in the name of Goddis sone .
62005014	And this is the trist which we han to God , that what euer thing we axen aftir his wille , he schal here vs .
62005015	And we witen , that he herith vs , what euer thing we axen ; we witen , that we han the axyngis , which we axen of hym .
62005016	He that woot that his brother synneth a synne not to deth , axe he , and lijf schal be youun to hym that synneth not to deth . Ther is a synne to deth ; ` not for it Y seie , that ony man preie .
62005017	Ech wickidnesse is synne , and ther is synne to deth .
62005018	We witen , that ech man that is borun of God , synneth not ; but the generacioun of God kepith hym , and the wickid touchith hym not .
62005019	We witen , that we ben of God , and al the world is set in yuel .
62005020	And we witen , that the sone of God cam in fleisch , and yaf to vs wit , that we know veri God , and be in the veri sone of hym .
62005021	This is veri God , and euerlastynge lijf . My litle sones , kepe ye you fro maumetis .
63001001	The eldere man , to the chosun ladi , and to her children , whiche Y loue in treuthe ; and not Y aloone , but also alle men that knowen treuthe ;
63001002	for the treuthe that dwellith in you , and with you schal be with outen ende .
63001003	Grace be with you , merci , and pees of God the fadir , and of Jhesu Crist , the sone of the fadir , in treuthe and charite .
63001004	I ioiede ful myche , for Y foond of thi sones goynge in treuthe , as we resseyueden maundement of the fadir .
63001005	And now Y preye thee , ladi , not as writinge a newe maundement to thee , but that that we hadden fro the bigynnyng , that we loue ech other .
63001006	And this is charite , that we walke after his maundementis . For this is the comaundement , that as ye herden at the bigynnyng , walke ye in hym .
63001007	For many disseyueris wenten out in to the world , which knoulechen not that Jhesu Crist hath come in fleisch ; this is a disseyuere and antecrist .
63001008	Se ye you silf , lest ye lesen the thingis that ye han wrouyt , that ye resseyue ful mede ;
63001009	witynge that ech man that goith bifore , and dwellith not in the teching of Crist , hath not God . He that dwellith in the teching , hath bothe the sone and the fadir .
63001010	If ony man cometh to you , and bryngith not this teching , nyle ye resseyue hym in to hous , nether seie ye to hym , Heil .
63001011	For he that seith to hym , Heil , comyneth with hise yuel werkis . Lo ! Y biforseide to you , that ye be not confoundid in the dai of oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
63001012	Y haue mo thingis to write to you , and Y wolde not bi parchemyn and enke ; for Y hope that Y schal come to you , and speke mouth to mouth , that your ioye be ful .
63001013	The sones of thi chosun sistir greten thee wel . The grace of God be with thee . Amen .
64001001	The eldere man to Gayus , most dere brother , whom Y loue in treuthe .
64001002	Most dere brothir , of alle thingis Y make preyer , that thou entre , and fare welefuly , as thi soule doith welefuli .
64001003	Y ioyede greetli , for britheren camen , and baren witnessing to thi treuthe , ` as thou walkist in treuthe .
64001004	Y haue not more grace of these thingis , than that Y here that my sones walke in treuthe .
64001005	Most dere brother , thou doist feithfuli , what euer thou worchist in britheren , and that in to pilgrymys ,
64001006	which yeldiden witnessing to thi charite , in the siyt of the chirche ; which thou leddist forth , and doist wel worthili to God .
64001007	For thei wenten forth for his name , and token no thing of hethene men .
64001008	Therfor we owen to resseyue siche , that we be euen worcheris of treuthe .
64001009	I hadde write perauenture to the chirche , but this Diotrepes , that loueth to bere primacie in hem , resseyueth not vs .
64001010	For this thing , if Y schal come , Y schal moneste hise werkis , whiche he doith , chidinge ayens vs with yuel wordis . And as if these thingis suffisen not to hym , nether he resseyueth britheren , and forbedith hem that resseyuen , and puttith out of the chirche .
64001011	Moost dere brothir , nyle thou sue yuel thing , but that that is good thing . He that doith wel , is of God ; he that doith yuel , seeth not God .
64001012	Witnessing is yoldun to Demetrie of alle men , and of treuthe it silf ; but also we beren witnessing , and thou knowist , that oure witnessing is trewe .
64001013	Y hadde many thingis to wryte to thee , but Y wolde not write to thee bi enke and penne .
64001014	For Y hope soone to se thee , and we schulen speke mouth to mouth . Pees be to thee . Frendis greten thee wel . Greete thou wel frendis bi name .
64001015	
65001001	Judas , the seruaunt of Jhesu Crist , and brother of James , to these that ben louyd , that ben in God the fadir , and to hem that ben clepid and kept of Jhesu Crist ,
65001002	mercy , and pees , and charite be fillid to you .
65001003	Moost dere britheren , Y doynge al bisynesse to write to you of youre comyn helthe , hadde nede to write to you , and preye to striue strongli for the feith that is onys takun to seyntis .
65001004	For summe vnfeithful men priueli entriden , that sum tyme weren bifore writun in to this dom , and ouerturnen the grace of oure God in to letcherie , and denyen hym that is oneli a Lord , oure Lord Jhesu Crist .
65001005	But Y wole moneste you onys , that witen alle thingis , that Jhesus sauyde his puple fro the lond of Egipt , and the secunde tyme loste hem that bileueden not .
65001006	And he reseruede vndur derknesse aungels , that kepten not her prinshod , but forsoken her hous , in to the dom of the greet God , in to euerlastynge bondis .
65001007	As Sodom , and Gomorre , and the nyy coostid citees , that in lijk maner diden fornycacioun , and yeden awei aftir othir fleisch , and ben maad ensaumple , suffrynge peyne of euerelastinge fier .
65001008	In lijk maner also these that defoulen the fleisch , and dispisen lordschip , and blasfemen mageste .
65001009	Whanne Myyhel , arkaungel , disputide with the deuel , and stroof of Moises bodi , he was not hardi to brynge in dom of blasfemye , but seide , The Lord comaunde to thee .
65001010	But these men blasfemen , what euer thingis thei knowen not . For what euer thingis thei knowen kyndli as doumbe beestis , in these thei ben corupt .
65001011	Wo to hem that wenten the weie of Caym , and that ben sched out bi errour of Balaam for mede , and perischiden in the ayenseiyng of Chore .
65001012	These ben in her metis , feestynge togidere to filthe , with out drede fedinge hemsilf . These ben cloudis with out watir , that ben borun aboute of the wyndis ; heruest trees with out fruyt , twies deed , drawun vp bi the roote ;
65001013	wawis of the woode see , fomynge out her confusiouns ; errynge sterris , to whiche the tempest of derknessis is kept with outen ende .
65001014	But Enoch , the seuenthe fro Adam , profeciede of these , and seide , Lo ! the Lord cometh with hise hooli thousandis ,
65001015	to do dom ayens alle men , and to repreue alle vnfeithful men of alle the werkis of the wickidnesse of hem , bi whiche thei diden wickidli , and of alle the harde wordis , that wyckid synneris han spoke ayens God .
65001016	These ben grutcheris ful of pleyntis , wandrynge aftir her desiris ; and the mouth of hem spekith pride , worschipinge persoones , bi cause of wynnyng .
65001017	And ye , moost dere britheren , be myndeful of the wordis , whiche ben bifor seid of apostlis of oure Lord Jhesu Crist ; whiche seiden to you ,
65001018	that in the laste tymes ther schulen come gilours , wandringe aftir her owne desiris , not in pitee .
65001019	These ben , whiche departen hemsilf , beestli men , not hauynge spirit .
65001020	But ye , moost dere britheren , aboue bilde you silf on youre moost hooli feith , and preye ye in the Hooli Goost ,
65001021	and kepe you silf in the loue of God , and abide ye the merci of oure Lord Jhesu Crist in to lijf euerlastynge .
65001022	And repreue ye these men that ben demed ,
65001023	but saue ye hem , and take ye hem fro the fier . And do ye merci to othere men , in the drede of God , and hate ye also thilke defoulid coote , which is fleischli .
65001024	But to him that is miyti to kepe you with out synne , and to ordeyne bifore the siyt of his glorie you vnwemmed in ful out ioye , in the comynge of oure Lord Jhesu Crist , to God aloone oure sauyour ,
65001025	bi Jhesu Crist oure Lord , be glorie , and magnefiyng , empire , and power , bifore alle worldis , ` and now and in to alle worldis of worldis . Amen .
66001001	Apocalips of Jhesu Crist , which God yaf to hym to make open to hise seruauntis , whiche thingis it bihoueth to be maad soone . And he signyfiede , sending bi his aungel to his seruaunt Joon ,

66001003	Blessid is he that redith , and he that herith the wordis of this prophecie , and kepith tho thingis that ben writun in it ; for the tyme is niy .
66001004	Joon to seuene chirchis , that ben in Asie , grace and pees to you , of him that is , and that was , and that is to comynge ; and of the seuene spiritis , that ben in the siyt of his trone ; and of Jhesu Crist ,
66001005	that is a feithful witnesse , the firste bigetun of deed men , and prince of kingis of the erthe ; which louyde vs , and waischide vs fro oure synnes in his blood ,
66001006	and made vs a kyngdom , and preestis to God and to his fader ; to hym be glorie and empire in to worldis of worldis .
66001007	Amen . Lo ! he cometh with clowdis , and ech iye schal se hym , and thei that prickiden hym ; and alle the kynredis of the erthe schulen beweile hem silf on hym .
66001008	Yhe , Amen ! Y am alpha and oo , the bigynnyng and the ende , seith the Lord God , that is , and that was , and that is to comynge , almyyti .
66001009	I , Joon , youre brothir , and partener in tribulacioun , and kingdom , and pacience in Crist Jhesu , was in an ile , that is clepid Pathmos , for the word of God , and for the witnessyng of Jhesu .
66001010	Y was in spirit in the Lordis dai , and Y herde bihynde me a greet vois , as of a trumpe ,
66001011	seiynge to me , Write thou in a book that thing that thou seest , and sende to the seuene chirchis that ben in Asie ; to Ephesus , to Smyrma , and to Pergamus , and to Tiatira , and to Sardis , and to Filadelfia , and to Loadicia .
66001012	And Y turnede , that Y schulde se the vois that spak with me ; and Y turnede , and Y say seuene candelstikis of gold ,
66001013	and in the myddil of the seuene goldun candelstikis oon lijk to the sone of man , clothid with a long garnement , and gird at the tetis with a goldun girdil .
66001014	And the heed of hym and his heeris weren whijt , as whijt wolle , and as snow ; and the iyen of hym as flawme of fier ,
66001015	and hise feet lijk to latoun , as in a brennynge chymney ; and the vois of hym as the vois of many watris .
66001016	And he hadde in his riyt hoond seuene sterris , and a swerd scharp on euer ethir side wente out of his mouth ; and his face as the sunne schyneth in his virtu .
66001017	And whanne Y hadde seyn hym , Y felde doun at hise feet , as deed . And he puttide his riyt hond on me , and seide , Nyle thou drede ; Y am the firste and the laste ; and Y am alyue , and Y was deed ;
66001018	and lo ! Y am lyuynge in to worldis of worldis , and Y haue the keyes of deth and of helle .
66001019	Therfor write thou whiche thingis thou hast seyn , and whiche ben , and whiche it bihoueth to be don aftir these thingis .
66001020	The sacrament of the seuene sterris , which thou seiyest in my riyt hond , and the seuene goldun candelstikis ; the seuene sterris ben aungels of the seuene chirchis , and the seuene candelstikis ben seuene chirchis .
66002001	And to the aungel of the chirche of Efesus write thou , These thingis seith he , that holdith the seuene sterris in his riyt hond , which walkith in the middil of the seuene goldun candilstikis .
66002002	Y woot thi werkis , and trauel , and thi pacience , and that thou maist not suffre yuele men ; and thou hast asaied hem that seien that thei ben apostlis , and ben not , and thou hast foundun hem lieris ;
66002003	and thou hast pacience , and thou hast suffrid for my name , and failidist not .
66002004	But Y haue ayens thee a fewe thingis , that thou hast left thi firste charite .
66002005	Therfor be thou myndeful fro whennus thou hast falle , and do penaunce , and do the firste werkis ; ether ellis , Y come soone to thee , and Y schal moue thi candilstike fro his place , but ` thou do penaunce .
66002006	But thou hast this good thing , that thou hatidist the dedis of Nycholaitis , the whiche also Y hate .
66002007	He that hath eeris , here he , what the spirit seith to the chirchis . To hym that ouercometh Y schal yyue to ete of the tre of lijf , that is in the paradis of my God .
66002008	And to the aungel of the chirche of Smyrma write thou , These thingis seith the firste and the laste , that was deed , and lyueth .
66002009	Y woot thi tribulacioun , and thi pouert , but thou art riche ; and thou art blasfemyd of hem , that seien , that thei ben Jewis , and ben not , but ben the synagoge of Sathanas .
66002010	Drede thou no thing of these thingis , whiche thou schalt suffre . Lo ! the deuel schal sende summe of you in to prisoun , that ye be temptid ; and ye schulen haue tribulacioun ten daies . Be thou feithful to the deth , and Y schal yyue to thee a coroun of lijf .
66002011	He that hath eeris , here he , what the spirit seith to the chirchis . He that ouercometh , schal not be hirt of the secounde deth .
66002012	And to the aungel of the chirche of Pergamus write thou , These thingis seith he , that hath the swerd scharp on ech side .
66002013	Y woot where thou dwellist , where the seete of Sathanas is ; and thou holdist my name , and denyedist not my feith . And in tho daies was Antifas , my feithful witnesse , that was slayn at you , where Sathanas dwellith .
66002014	But Y haue ayens thee a fewe thingis ; for thou hast ` there men holdinge the teching of Balaam , which tauyte Balaac for to sende sclaundre bifor the sones of Israel , to ete of sacrificis of ydols , and to do fornicacioun ;
66002015	so also thou hast men holdinge the teching of Nycholaitis .
66002016	Also do thou penaunce ; ` yif ony thing lesse , Y schal come soone to thee , and Y schal fiyte with hem with the swerd of my mouth .
66002017	He that hath eeris , here he , what the spirit seith to the chirches . To him that ouercometh Y schal yyue aungel mete hid ; and Y schal yyue to hym a whiit stoon , and in the stoon a newe name writun , which no man knowith , but he that takith .
66002018	And to the aungel of the chirche of Tiatira write thou , These thingis seith the sone of God , that hath iyen as flawme of fier , and hise feet lijk latoun .
66002019	Y knowe thi werkis , and feith , and charite , and thi seruyce , and thi pacience , and thi laste werkis mo than the formere .

66002022	And lo ! Y sende hir in to a bed , and thei that doen letcherie with hir schulen be in moost tribulacioun , but thei don penaunce of hir werkis .
66002023	And Y schal slee hir sones in to deth , and alle chirchis schulen wite , that Y am serchinge reynes and hertis ; and Y schal yyue to ech man of you after hise werkis .
66002024	And Y seie to you , and to othere that ben at Tiatire , who euer han not this teching , and that knewen not the hiynesse of Sathanas , hou thei seien , Y schal not sende on you another charge ; netheles holde ye that that ye han ,

66002029	He that hath eeris , here he , what the spirit seith to the chirchis .
66003001	And to the aungel of the chirche of Sardis write thou , These thingis seith he , that hath the seuene spiritis of God , and the seuene sterris . Y woot thi werkis , for thou hast a name , that thou lyuest , and thou art deed .
66003002	Be thou wakynge , and conferme thou othere thingis , that weren to diynge ; for Y fynde not thi werkis fulle bifore my God .

66003005	He that ouercometh , schal be clothid thus with whijt clothis ; and Y schal not do awei his name fro the book of lijf , and Y schal knoueleche his name bifore my fadir , and bifore hise aungels .

66003020	Lo ! Y stonde at the dore , and knocke ; if ony man herith my voys , and openith the yate to me , Y shal entre to hym , and soupe with hym , and he with me .
66003021	And Y schal yyue to hym that schal ouercome , to sitte with me in my trone , as also Y ouercam , and sat with my fadir in his trone .
66003022	He that hath eeris , here he , what the spirit seith to the chirchis .
66004001	Aftir these thingis Y say , and lo ! a dore was openyd in heuene . And the firste vois that Y herde , was as of a trumpe spekinge with me , and seide , Stye thou vp hidur , and Y shal schewe to thee whiche thingis it bihoueth to be don soone aftir these thingus .
66004002	Anoon Y was in spirit , and lo ! a seete was sett in heuene , and vpon the seete oon sittynge .
66004003	And he that sat , was lijk the siyt of a stoon iaspis , and to sardyn ; and a reynbowe was in cumpas of the seete , lijk the siyt of smaragdyn .
66004004	And in the cumpas of the seete weren foure and twenti smale seetis ; and aboue the troones foure and twenti eldre men sittinge , hilid aboute with whijt clothis , and in the heedis of hem goldun corouns .
66004005	And leitis , and voices , and thundringis camen out of the trone ; and seuene laumpis brennynge bifore the trone , whiche ben the seuene spiritis of God .
66004006	And bifor the seete as a see of glas , lijk a crystal , and in the myddil of the seete , and in the cumpas of the seete , foure beestis ful of iyen bifore and bihynde .
66004007	And the firste beeste lijk a lyoun ; and the secounde beeste lijk a calf ; and the thridde beeste hauynge a face as of a man ; and the fourthe beeste lijk an egle fleynge .
66004008	And the foure beestis hadden euery of hem sixe wyngis ; and al aboute and with ynne thei weren ful of iyen ; and thei hadden not reste dai and nyyt , seiynge , Hooli , hooli , hooli , the Lord God almyyti , that was , and that is , and that is to comynge .
66004009	And whanne tho foure beestis yauen glorie , and honour , and blessing to hym that sat on the trone , that lyueth in to worldis of worldis ,
66004010	the foure and twenti eldre men fellen doun bifor hym that sat on the trone , and worschipiden hym that lyueth in to worldis of worldis . And thei casten her corouns bifor the trone ,
66004011	and seiden , Thou , Lord ` oure God , art worthi to take glorie , and onour , and vertu ; for thou madist of nouyt alle thingis , and for thi wille tho weren , and ben maad of nouyt .
66005001	And Y say in the riythond of the sittere on the trone , a book writun with ynne and with out , and seelid with seuene seelis .
66005002	And Y say a strong aungel , prechynge with a greet vois , Who is worthi to opene the book , and to vndon the seelis of it ?
66005003	And noon in heuene , nether in erthe , nether vnder erthe , myyte opene the book , nether biholde it .
66005004	And Y wepte myche , for noon was founde worthi to opene the book , nethir to se it .
66005005	And oon of the eldre men seide to me , Wepe thou not ; lo ! a lioun of the lynage of Juda , the roote of Dauid , hath ouercomun to opene the book , and to vndon the seuene seelis of it .
66005006	And Y say , and lo ! in the myddil of the trone , and of the foure beestis , and in the myddil of the eldre men , a lombe stondynge as slayn , that hadde seuene hornes , and seuene iyen , whiche ben seuene spiritis of God , sent in to al the erthe .
66005007	And he cam , and took of the riythond of the sittere in the trone the book .
66005008	And whanne he hadde opened the book , the foure beestis and the foure and twenti eldre men fellen doun bifore the lomb ; and hadden ech of hem harpis , and goldun violis ful of odours , whiche ben the preyeris of seyntis .
66005009	And thei sungun a newe song , and seiden , Lord oure God , thou art worthi to take the book , and to opene the seelis of it ; for thou were slayn , and ayenbouytist vs to God in thi blood , of ech lynage , ` and tunge , and puple , and nacioun ;

66005011	And Y say , and herde the vois of many aungels al aboute the trone , and of the beestis , and of the eldre men . And the noumbre of hem was thousyndis of thousyndis , seiynge with a greet vois ,
66005012	The lomb that was slayn , is worthi to take vertu , and godhed , and wisdom , and strengthe , and onour , and glorie , and blessing .
66005013	And ech creature that is in heuene , and that is on erthe , and vndur erthe , and the see , and whiche thingis ben in it , Y herde alle seiynge , To hym that sat in the trone , and to the lomb , blessyng , and onour , and glorie , and power , in to worldis of worldis .
66005014	And the foure beestis seiden , Amen . And the foure and twenti eldre men fellen doun on her faces , and worschipiden hym that lyueth in to worldis of worldis .
66006001	And Y sai , that the lomb hadde openyd oon of the seuene seelis . And Y herde oon of the foure beestis seiynge , as a vois of thundur , Come , and se .
66006002	And Y sai , and lo ! a white hors ; and he that sat on hym hadde a bouwe , and a coroun was youun to hym . And he wente out ouercomynge , that he schulde ouercome .
66006003	And whanne he hadde openyd the secounde seel , I herde the secounde beest seiynge , Come ` thou , and se .
66006004	And another reed hors wente out ; and it was youun to hym that sat on hym , that he schulde take pees fro the erthe , and that thei sle to gidere hem silf ; and a greet swerd was youun to hym .
66006005	And whanne he hadde openyd the thridde seel , Y herde the thridde beest seiynge , Come thou , and se . And lo ! a blak hors ; and he that sat on hym hadde a balaunce in his hond .
66006006	And Y herde ` as a vois in the myddil of the foure beestis , seiynge , A bilibre of wheete for a peny , and thre bilibris of barli for a peny ; and hirte thou not wyn , ne oile .
66006007	And whanne he hadde openyd the fourthe seel , Y herde a vois of the ` foure beestis , seiynge , Come thou , and se .
66006008	And lo ! a pale hors ; and the name was Deth to hym that sat on hym , and helle suede hym . And power was youun to hym on foure partis of the erthe , for to sle with swerd , and with hungur , and with deth , and with beestis of the erthe .
66006009	And whanne he hadde opened the fyuethe seel , Y say vndur the auter the soulis of men slayn for the word of God , and for the witnessing that thei hadden .
66006010	And thei crieden with a geet vois , and seiden , Hou long thou , Lord , that art hooli and trewe , demest not , and vengest not oure blood of these that dwellen in the erthe ?
66006011	And white stoolis , for ech soule a stoole , weren youun to hem ; and it was seide to hem , that thei schulden reste yit a litil tyme , til the noumbre of her felowis and of her britheren ben fulfillid , that ben to be slayn , as also thei .
66006012	And Y say , whanne he hadde openyd the sixte seel , and lo ! a greet erthe mouyng was maad ; and the sunne was maad blak , as a sak of heire , and al the moone was maad as blood .
66006013	And the sterris of heuene felden doun on the erthe , as a fige tre sendith his vnripe figis , whanne it is mouyd of a greet wynd .
66006014	And heuene wente awei , as a book wlappid in ; and alle munteyns and ilis weren mouyd fro her placis .
66006015	And kingis of the erthe , and princis , and tribunes , and riche , and stronge , and ech bonde man , and freman , hidden hem in dennys and stoonys of hillis .
66006016	And thei seien to hillis and to stoonys , Falle ye on vs , and hide ye vs fro the face of hym that sittith on the trone , and fro the wrath of the lomb ;
66006017	for the greet dai of her wraththe cometh , and who schal mowe stonde ?
66007001	Aftir these thingis Y sai foure aungels stondinge on the foure corneris of the erthe , holdinge foure wyndis of the erthe , that thei blewen not on the erthe , nether on the see , nether on ony tre .
66007002	And Y sawy anothir aungel stiynge fro the risynge of the sunne , that hadde a signe of the lyuynge God . And he criede with a greet vois to the foure aungels , to whiche it was youun to noye the erthe , and the see ,
66007003	and seide , Nyle ye noye the erthe , and see , nether trees , til we marken the seruauntis of oure God in the forhedis of hem .
66007004	And I herde the noumbre of men that weren markid , an hundrid thousynde and foure and fourti thousynde markid , of euery lynage of the sones of Israel ;
66007005	of the lynage of Juda , twelue thousynde markid ; of the lynage of Ruben , twelue thousynde markid ; of the lynage of Gad , twelue thousynde markid ;

66007009	Aftir these thingis Y sai a greet puple , whom no man myyte noumbre , of alle folkis , and lynagis , and puplis , and langagis , stondinge bifore the trone , in the siyt of the lomb ; and thei weren clothid with white stoolis , and palmes weren in the hondis of hem .
66007010	And thei crieden with greet vois , and seiden , Heelthe to oure God , that sittith on the troone , and to the lombe .
66007011	And alle aungels ` stoden al aboute the trone , and the eldre men , and the foure beestis . And thei fellen doun in the siyt of the trone , on her faces , and worschipiden God , and seiden , Amen !

66007013	Amen . And oon of the senyours answerde , and seide to me , Who ben these , that ben clothid with white stoolis ? and fro whennus came thei ?
66007014	And Y seide to hym , My lord , thou woost . And he seide to me , These ben thei , that camen fro greet tribulacioun , and waischiden her stoolis , and maden hem white in the blood of the lomb .
66007015	Therfor thei ben bifor the trone of God , and seruen to hym dai and niyt , in his temple . And he that sittith in the trone , dwellith on hem .
66007016	Thei schulen no more hungur , nether thirste , nether sunne schal falle on hem , ne ony heete .
66007017	For the lomb , that is in the myddil of the trone , schal gouerne hem , and schal lede forth hem to the wellis of watris of lijf ; and God schal wipe awei ech teer fro the iyen of hem .
66008001	And whanne he hadde openyd the seuenthe seel , a silence was maad in heuene , as half an our .
66008002	And Y say seuene aungels stondinge in the siyt of God , and seuene trumpis weren youun to hem .
66008003	And another aungel cam , and stood bifor the auter , and hadde a goldun censer ; and many encencis weren youun to hym , that he schulde yyue of the preiers of alle seyntis on the goldun auter , that is bifor the trone of God .
66008004	And the smoke of encencis of the preiers of the hooli men stiede vp fro the aungels hoond bifor God .
66008005	And the aungel took the censere , and fillide it of the fier of the auter , and castide in to the erthe . And thundris , and voices , and leityngis weren maad , and a greet erthe mouyng .
66008006	And the seuene aungels , that hadden seuene trumpis , maden hem redi , that thei schulden trumpe .
66008007	And the firste aungel trumpide ; and hail was maad , and fier meynd togidere in blood ; and it was sent in to the erthe . And the thridde part of the erthe was brent , and the thridde part of trees was brent , and al the green gras was brent .
66008008	And the secunde aungel trumpide ; and as a greet hil brennynge with fier was cast in to the see ;
66008009	and the thridde part of the see was maad blood , and the thridde part of creature was deed , that hadde lyues in the see , and the thridde part of schippis perischide .
66008010	And the thridde aungel trumpide ; and a greet sterre brennynge as a litil brond , felle fro heuene ; and it felle in to the thridde part of floodis , and in to the wellis of watris .
66008011	And the name of the sterre is seid Wormod . And the thridde part of watris was maad in to wormod ; and many men weren deed of the watris , for tho weren maad bittere .
66008012	And the fourthe aungel trumpide ; and the thridde part of the sunne was smytun , and the thridde part of the moone , and the thridde part of sterris , so that the thridde part of hem was derkid , and the thridde part of the dai schynede not , and also of the nyyt .
66008013	And Y say , and herde the vois of an egle fleynge bi the myddil of heuene , and seiynge with a greet vois , Wo ! wo ! wo ! to men that dwellen in erthe , of the othir voices of thre aungels , that schulen trumpe aftir .
66009001	And the fyuethe aungel trumpide ; and Y say , that a sterre hadde falle doun fro heuene in to erthe ; and the keye of the pit of depnesse was youun to it .
66009002	And it openede the pit of depnesse , and a smoke of the pit stiede vp , as the smoke of a greet furneis ; and the sunne was derkid , and the eir , of the smoke of the pit .
66009003	And locustis wenten out of the smoke of the pit in to erthe ; and power was youun to hem , as scorpiouns of the erthe han power .
66009004	And it was comaundid to hem , that thei schulden not hirte the gras of erthe , nether ony grene thing , nether ony tre , but oneli men , that han not the signe of God in her forhedis .
66009005	And it was youun to hem , that thei schulden not sle hem , but that thei schulden ` be turmentid fyue monethis ; and the turmentyng of hem , as the turmentyng of a scorpioun , whanne he smytith a man .
66009006	And in tho daies men schulen seke deth , and thei schulen not fynde it ; and thei schulen desire to die , and deth schal fle fro hem .
66009007	And the licnesse of locustis ben lijk horsis maad redi ` in to batel ; and on the heedis of hem as corouns lijk gold , and the facis of hem as the faces of men .
66009008	And thei hadden heeris , as heeris of wymmen ; and the teeth of hem weren as teeth of liouns .
66009009	And thei hadden haburiouns , as yren haburiouns , and the vois of her wengis as the vois of charis of many horsis rennynge ` in to batel .
66009010	And thei hadden tailis lijk scorpiouns , and prickis weren in the tailis of hem ; and the myyt of hem was to noye men fyue monethis .
66009011	And thei hadden on hem a kyng , the aungel of depnesse , to whom the name bi Ebrew is Laabadon , but bi Greek Appollion , and bi Latyn ` he hath a name ` Extermynans , that is , a distriere .
66009012	O wo is passid , and lo ! yit comen twei woes .
66009013	Aftir these thingis also the sixte aungel trumpide ; and Y herde a vois fro foure corneris of the goldun auter , that is bifore the iyen of God ,
66009014	and seide to the sixte aungel that hadde a trumpe , Vnbynde thou foure aungels , that ben boundun in the greet flood Eufrates .
66009015	And the foure aungels weren vnboundun , whiche weren redi in to our , and dai , and monethe , and yeer , to sle the thridde part of men .
66009016	And the noumbre of the oost of horse men was twenti thousynde sithis ten thousynde . Y herde the noumbre of hem .
66009017	And so Y say horsis in visioun ; and thei that saten on hem hadden firy haburiouns , and of iacynt , and of brymstoon . And the heedis of the horsis weren as heedis of liouns ; and fier , and smoke , and brymston , cometh forth of the mouth of hem .
66009018	Of these thre plagis the thridde part of men was slayn , of the fier , and of the smoke , and of the brymston , that camen out of the mouth of hem .
66009019	For the power of the horsis is in the mouth of hem , and in the tailis of hem ; for the tailis of hem ben lyk to serpentis , hauynge heedis , and in hem thei noyen .
66009020	And the tothir men , that weren not slayn in these plagis , nether dyden penaunce of the werkis of her hondis , that thei worschipeden not deuelis , and simylacris of gold , and of siluer , and of bras , and of stoon , and of tre , whiche nethir mown se , nether heere , nether wandre ;
66009021	and diden not penaunce of her mansleyngis , nether of her witchecraftis , nethir of her fornicacioun , nethir of her theftis , weren slayn .
66010001	And Y say another stronge aungel comynge doun fro heuene , clothid with a cloude , and the reynbowe on his heed ; and the face of him was as the sunne , and the feet of hym as a piler of fier .
66010002	And he hadde in his hoond a litil book openyd ; and he sette his riyt foot on the see , and the left foot on the erthe .
66010003	And he criede with a greet vois , as a lioun whanne he roreth ; and whanne he hadde cried , the seuene thundris spaken her voicis .
66010004	And whanne the seuene thundris hadden spoken her voicis , Y was to writynge . And Y herde a vois fro heuene , seiynge , Marke thou what thingis the seuene thundris spaken , and nyle thou write hem .
66010005	And the aungel whom Y say stondinge aboue the see , and aboue the erthe , lifte vp his hond to heuene ,
66010006	and swoor bi hym that lyueth in to worldis of worldis , that maad of nouyt heuene , and tho thingis whiche ben in it , and the erthe , and tho thingis that ben in it , and the see , and tho thingis that ben in it , that time schal no more be .
66010007	But in the daies of the vois of the seuenethe aungel , whanne he schal bigynne to trumpe , the mysterie of God schal be endid , as he prechide bi hise seruauntis prophetis .
66010008	And Y herde a vois fro heuene eftsoone spekynge with me , and seiynge , Go thou , and take the book , that is openyd , fro the hoond of the aungel , that stondith aboue the see , and on the lond .
66010009	And Y wente to the aungel , and seide to hym , that he schulde yyue me the book . And he seide to me , Take the book , and deuoure it ; and it schal make thi wombe to be bittir , but in thi mouth it schal be swete as hony .
66010010	And Y took the book of the aungels hond , and deuouride it , and it was in my mouth as swete hony ; and whanne Y hadde deuourid it , my wombe was bittere .
66010011	And he seide to me , It bihoueth thee eftsoone to prophesie to hethene men , and to puplis , and langagis , and to many kingis .
66011001	And a reed lijk a yerde was youun to me , and it was seid to me , Rise thou , and meete the temple of God , and the auter , and men that worschipen in it .
66011002	But caste thou out the foryerd , that is with out the temple , and mete not it ; for it is youun to hethene men , and thei schulen defoule the hooli citee bi fourti monethis and tweyne .

66011004	These ben tweyne olyues , and twei candilstikis , and thei stonden in the siyt of the Lord of the erthe .
66011005	And if ony man wole anoye hem , fier schal go out of the mouth of hem , and schal deuoure her enemyes . And if ony wole hirte hem , thus it bihoueth hym to be slayn .
66011006	These han power to close heuene , that it reyne not in the daies of her prophesie ; and thei han power on watris , to turne hem in to blood ; and to smyte the erthe with euery plage , and as ofte as thei wolen .
66011007	And whanne thei schulen ende her witnessing , the beeste that stieth vp fro depnesse , schal make batel ayens hem , and schal ouercome hem , and schal sle hem .
66011008	And the bodies of hem schulen ligge in the stretis of the greet citee , that is clepid goostli Sodom , and Egipt , where the Lord of hem was crucified .
66011009	And summe of lynagis , and of puplis , and of langagis , and of hethene men , schulen se the bodies of hem bi thre daies and an half ; and thei schulen not suffre the bodies of hem to be put in biriels .
66011010	And men enhabitynge the erthe schulen haue ioye on hem ; and thei schulen make myrie , and schulen sende yiftis togidere , for these twei prophetis turmentiden hem that dwellen on the erthe .

66011012	And thei herden a greet vois fro heuene , seiynge to hem , Come vp hidir . And thei stieden in to heuene in a cloude , and the enemyes of hem sayn hem .
66011013	And in that our a greet erthe mouyng was maad , and the tenthe part of the citee felle doun ; and the names of men seuene thousynde weren slayn in the erthe mouyng ; and the tother weren sent in to drede , and yauen glorie to God of heuene .
66011014	The secounde wo is gon , and lo ! the thridde wo schal come soone .
66011015	And the seuenthe aungel trumpide , and grete voicis weren maad in heuene , and seiden , The rewme of this world is maad ` oure Lordis , and of Crist , his sone ; and he schal regne in to worldis of worldis .
66011016	Amen . And the foure and twenti eldre men , that saten in her seetis in the siyt of the Lord , fellen on her faces , and worschipiden God ,
66011017	and seiden , We don thankyngis to thee , Lord God almyyti , which art , and which were , and which art to comynge ; which hast takun thi greet vertu , and hast regned .
66011018	And folkis ben wrooth , and thi wraththe cam , and tyme of dede men to be demyd , and to yelde mede to thi seruauntis , and prophetis , and halewis , and dredynge thi name , to smale and to grete , and to distrie hem that corrumpiden the erthe .
66011019	And the temple of God in heuene was openyd , and the arke of his testament was seyn in his temple ; and leityngis weren maad , and voices , and thondris , and ` erthe mouyng , and greet hail .
66012001	And a greet signe apperide in heuene ; a womman clothid with the sunne , and the moone vndur hir feet , and in the heed of hir a coroun of twelue sterris .
66012002	And sche hadde in wombe , and sche crieth , trauelynge of child , and is turmentid , that sche bere child .
66012003	And another signe was seyn in heuene ; and lo ! a greet reede dragoun , that hadde seuene heedis , and ten hornes , and in the heedis of hym seuene diademes .
66012004	And the tail of hym drow the thridde part of sterris of heuene , and sente hem in to the erthe . And the dragoun stood bifore the womman , that was to berynge child , that whanne sche hadde borun child , he schulde deuoure hir sone .
66012005	And sche bar a knaue child , that was to reulinge alle folkis in an yrun yerde ; and hir sone was rauyschid to God , and to his trone .
66012006	And the womman flei in to wildirnesse , where sche hath a place maad redi of God , that he fede hir there a thousynde daies two hundrid and sixti .
66012007	And a greet batel was maad in heuene , and Myyhel and hise aungels fouyten with the dragoun . And the dragoun fauyt , and hise aungels ;
66012008	and thei hadden not myyt , nether the place of hem was foundun more in heuene .
66012009	And thilke dragoun was cast doun , the greet elde serpent , that is clepid the Deuel , and Sathanas , that disseyueth al the world ; he was cast doun in to the erthe , and hise aungels weren sent with hym .
66012010	And Y herde a greet vois in heuene , seiynge , Now is maad helthe , and vertu , and kyngdom of oure God , and the power of his Crist ; for the accuser of oure britheren is cast doun , which accuside hem bifor the siyte of oure God dai and nyyt .
66012011	And thei ouercamen hym for the blood of the lomb , and for the word of his witnessing ; and thei louyden not her lyues til to deth .
66012012	Therfor , ye heuenes , be ye glad , and ye that dwellen in hem . Wo to the erthe , and to the see ; for the fend is come doun to you , and hath greet wraththe , witynge that he hath litil tyme .
66012013	And after that the dragoun sai , that he was cast doun to the erthe , he pursuede the womman , that bare the knaue child .
66012014	And twei wengis of a greet egle weren youun to the womman , that sche schulde flee in to deseert , in to hir place , where sche is fed by tyme , and tymes , and half a tyme , fro the face of the serpent .
66012015	And the serpent sente out of his mouth aftir the womman watir as a flood , that he schulde make hir to be drawun of the flood .
66012016	And the erthe helpide the womman , and the erthe openyde his mouth , and soop up the flood , that the dragoun sente of his mouth .
66012017	And the dragoun was wrooth ayens the womman , and he wente to make batel with othere of hir seed , that kepen the maundementis of God , and han the witnessing of Jhesu Crist .
66013001	And he stood on the grauel of the see . And Y sai a beeste stiynge vp of the see , hauynge seuene heedis , and ten hornes ; and on hise hornes ten diademes , and on hise heedis the names of blasfemye .
66013002	And the beeste , whom Y sai , was lijk a pard , and hise feet as the feet of a beere , and his mouth as the mouth of a lioun ; and the dragoun yaf his vertu and greet power to hym .
66013003	And Y sai oon of hise heedis , as slayn in to deth ; and the wounde of his deth was curid . And al erthe wondride after the beeste .
66013004	And thei worschipiden the dragoun , that yaf power to the beeste ; and thei worschipeden the beeste , and seiden , Who is lijk the beeste , and who schal mowe fiyte with it ?
66013005	And a mouth spekynge grete thingis , and blasfemyes , was youun ` to it ; and power was youun to it , to do two and fourti monethis .
66013006	And it openyde his mouth in to blasfemyes to God , to blasfeme his name , and his tabernacle , and hem that dwellen in heuene .
66013007	And it was youun to hym to make batel with seyntis , and to ouercome hem ; and power was youun to hym in to ech lynage , and puple , and langage , and folk .
66013008	And alle men worschipiden it , that dwellen in erthe , whos names ben not writun in the book of lijf of the lomb , that was slayn fro the bigynnyng of the world .
66013009	If ony man hath eeris , here he .
66013010	He that ledith in to caitifte , schal go in to caitifte ; he that sleeth with swerd , it bihoueth hym to be slayn with swerd . This is the pacience and the feith of seyntis .
66013011	And Y sai another beeste stiynge vp fro the erthe , and it hadde two hornes , lijk the lomb ; and it spak as the dragoun ,
66013012	and dide al the power of the formere beeste , in his siyt . And it made the erthe , and men dwellinge in it , to worschipe the firste beeste , whos wounde of deth was curid .
66013013	And it dide grete signes , that also it made fier to come doun fro heuene in to the erthe , in the siyt of alle men .
66013014	And it disseyueth men , that dwellen in erthe , for signes whiche ben youun ` to it to do in the siyt of the beeste ; seiynge to men dwellinge in erthe , that thei make an ymage of the beeste , that hath the wounde of swerd , and lyuede .
66013015	And it was youun to hym , that he schulde yyue spirit to the ymage of the beeste , and that the ymage of the beeste speke . And he schal make , that who euere honouren not the ymage of the beeste , be slayn .
66013016	And he schal make alle , smale and grete , and riche and pore , and fre men and bonde men , to haue a carecter in her riythoond , ethir in her forheedis ; that no man may bie ,
66013017	ethir sille , but thei han the caracter , ether the name of the beeste , ethir the noumbre of his name .
66013018	Here is wisdom ; he that hath vndurstonding , acounte the noumbre of the beeste ; for it is the noumbre of man , and his noumbre is sixe hundrid sixti and sixe .
66014001	And Y sai , and lo ! lomb stood on the mount of Sion , and with hym an hundrid thousynde and foure and fourti thousynde , hauynge his name , and the name of his fadir writun in her forhedis .
66014002	And Y herde a vois fro heuene , as the vois of many watris , and as the vois of a greet thundur ; and the vois which is herd , was as of many harperis harpinge in her harpis .
66014003	And thei sungun as a newe song bifor the seete of God , and bifore the foure beestis , and senyouris . And no man miyte seie the song , but thei an hundrid thousynde and foure and fourti thousynde , that ben bouyt fro the erthe .
66014004	These it ben , that ben not defoulid with wymmen ; for thei ben virgyns . These suen the lomb , whidir euer he schal go ; these ben bouyt of alle men , the firste fruytis to God , and to the lomb ;
66014005	and in the mouth of hem lesyng is not foundun ; for thei ben with out wem bifor the trone of God .
66014006	And Y say another aungel , fliynge bi the myddil of heuene , hauynge an euerlastinge gospel , that he schulde preche to men sittynge on erthe , and on ech folk , and lynage , and langage , and puple ;
66014007	and seide with a greet vois , Drede ye the Lord , and yyue ye to hym onour , for the our of his dom cometh ; and worschipe ye hym , that made heuene and erthe , the see , and alle thingis that ben in hem , and the wellis of watris .
66014008	And anothir aungel suede , seiynge , Thilke greet Babiloyne fel doun , fel doun , which yaf drinke to alle folkis of the wyn of wraththe of her fornycacioun .
66014009	And the thridde aungel suede hem , and seide with a greet vois , If ony man worschipe the beeste , and the ymage of it , and takith the carecter in his forheed , ether in his hoond ,
66014010	this schal drynke of the wyn of Goddis wraththe , that is meynd with clere wyn in the cuppe of his wraththe , and schal be turmentid with fier and brymston , in the siyt of hooli aungels , and bifore the siyt of the lomb .
66014011	And the smoke of her turmentis schal stie vp in to the worldis of worldis ; nether thei han reste dai and niyt , whiche worschipiden the beeste and his ymage , and yf ony man take the carect of his name .
66014012	Here is the pacience of seyntis , whiche kepen the maundementis of God , and the feith of Jhesu .
66014013	And Y herde a vois fro heuene , seiynge to me , Write thou , Blessid ben deed men , that dien in the Lord ; fro hennus forth now the spirit seith , that thei reste of her traueilis ; for the werkis of hem suen hem .
66014014	And Y say , and lo ! a white cloude , and aboue the cloude a sittere , lijk the sone of man , hauynge in his heed a goldun coroun , and in his hond a scharp sikil .
66014015	And another aungel wente out of the temple , and criede with greet vois to hym that sat on the cloude , Sende thi sikil , and repe , for the our cometh , that it be ropun ; for the corn of the erthe is ripe .
66014016	And he that sat on the cloude , sente his sikil in to the erthe , and rap the erthe .
66014017	And another aungel wente out of the temple , that is in heuene , and he also hadde a scharp sikile .
66014018	And another aungel wente out fro the auter , that hadde power on fier and water ; and he criede with a greet vois to hym that hadde the scharp sikil , and seide , Sende thi scharp sikil , and kitte awei the clustris of the vynyerd of the erthe , for the grapis of it ben ripe .
66014019	And the aungel sente his sikil in to the erthe , and gaderide grapis of the vynyerd of the erthe , and sente into the greet lake of Goddis wraththe .
66014020	And the lake was troddun without the citee , and the blood wente out of the lake til to the ` bridels of horsis , bi furlongis a thousynd and six hundrid .
66015001	And Y say another signe in heuene , greet and wondurful ; seuene aungels hauynge ` seuene the laste veniauncis , for the wraththe of God is endid in hem .
66015002	And Y say as a glasun see meynd with fier , and hem that ouercamen the beeste , and his ymage , and the noumbre of his name , stondynge aboue the glasun see , hauynge the harpis of God ;

66015004	Lord , who schal not drede thee , and magnyfie thi name ? for thou aloone art merciful ; for alle folkis schulen come , and worschipe in thi siyt , for thi domes ben open .
66015005	And aftir these thingis Y say , and lo ! the temple of the tabernacle of witnessyng was opened in heuene ;
66015006	and seuene aungels hauynge seuene plagis , wenten out of the temple , and weren clothid with a stoon clene and white , and weren bifor gird with goldun girdlis about the brestis .
66015007	And oon of the foure beestis yaf to the seuene aungels seuene goldun viols , ful of the wraththe of God , that lyueth in to worldis of worldis .
66015008	And the temple was fillid with smooke of the majestee of God , and of the vertu of hym ; and no man myyte entre in to the temple , til the seuene plagis of seuene angels weren endid .
66016001	And Y herde a greet vois fro heuene , seiynge to the seuene aungels , Go ye , and schede out the seuene viols of Goddis wraththe in to erthe .
66016002	And the firste aungel wente , and schedde out his viol in to the erthe ; and a wounde fers and werst was maad on alle that hadden the carect of the beeste , and on hem that worschipiden the beeste , and his ymage .
66016003	And the secounde aungel schedde out his viol in to the see , and the blood was maad , as of a deed thing ; and ech man lyuynge was deed in the see .
66016004	And the thridde aungel schedde out his viol on the floodis , and on the wellis of watris , and seide ,
66016005	Just art thou , Lord , that art , and that were hooli , that demest these thingis ;
66016006	for thei schedden out the blood of halewis and prophetis , and thou hast youun to hem blood to drinke ; for thei ben worthi .
66016007	And I herde anothir seiynge , Yhe ! Lord God almiyti , trewe and iust ben thi domes .
66016008	And the fourthe aungel schedde out his viol in to the sunne , and it was youun to hym to turmente men with heete and fier .
66016009	And men swaliden with greet heete , and blasfemyden the name of God hauynge power on these plagis , nether thei diden penaunce , that thei schulden yyue glorie to hym .
66016010	And the fifte aungel schedde out his viol on the seete of the beeste , and his kyngdom was maad derk ; and thei eten togidere her tungis for sorewe ,
66016011	and thei blasfemyden God of heuene , for sorewis of her woundis ; and thei diden not penaunce of her werkis .
66016012	And the sixte aungel schedde out his viol in ` that ilke greet flood Eufratis , and driede the watir of it , that weie were maad redi to kingis fro the sunne rysyng .
66016013	And Y say thre vnclene spiritis bi the manner of froggis go out of the mouth of the dragoun , and of the mouth of the beeste , and of the mouth of the fals prophete .
66016014	For thei ben spiritis of deuels , makynge signes , and thei gon forth to kingis of al erthe , to gadere hem in to batel , to the greet dai of almiyti God .
66016015	Lo ! Y come , as a niyt theefe . Blessid is he that wakith , and kepith hise clothis , that he wandre not nakid , and that thei se not the filthhed of hym .
66016016	And he schal gadre hem in to a place , that is clepid in Ebreu Hermagedon .
66016017	And the seuenthe aungel schedde out his viol in to the eyr , and a greet vois wente out of heuene fro the trone , and seide , It is don .

66016020	And ech ile flei awei , and hillis ben not foundun .
66016021	And greet hail as a talent cam doun fro heuene in to men ; and men blasfemyden God , for the plage of hail , for it was maad ful greet .
66017001	And oon of the seuene aungels cam , that hadde seuene viols , and spak with me , and seide , Come thou , Y schal schewe to thee the dampnacioun of the greet hoore , that sittith on many watris , with which kyngis of erthe diden fornicacioun ;
66017002	and thei that dwellen in the erthe ben maad drunkun of the wyn of her letcherie .
66017003	And he took me in to desert in spirit . And Y say a womman sittynge on a reed beeste , ful of names of blasfemye , hauynge seuene heedis , and ten hornes .
66017004	And the womman was enuyround with purpur , and reed , and ouergild with gold , and preciouse stoon , and peerls , hauynge a goldun cuppe in hir hoond , ful of abhomynaciouns and vnclennesse of her fornycacioun .

66017007	And the aungel seide to me , Whi wondrist thou ? I schal seie to thee the sacrament yf the womman , and of the beeste that berith hir , that hath seuene heedis and ten hornes .
66017008	The beeste which thou seist , was , and is not ; and sche schal stie fro depnesse , and sche schal go ` in to perisching . And men dwellinge in erthe schulen wondre , whos names ben not writun in the book of lijf fro the makinge of the world , seynge the beeste , that was , and is not .
66017009	And this is the witt , who that hath wisdom . The seuene heedis ben seuene hillis , on whiche the womman sittith , and kyngis seuene ben .
66017010	Fyue han feld doun , oon is , and anothir cometh not yit . And whanne he schal come , it bihoueth hym to dwelle a schort tyme .

66017013	These han a counsel , and schulen bitake her vertu and power to the beeste .
66017014	These schulen fiyte with the lomb , and the lomb schal ouercome hem ; for he is Lord of lordis , and kyng of kyngis ; and thei that ben with hym , ben clepid , chosun , and feithful .
66017015	And he seide to me , The watris whiche thou hast seyn , where the hoore sittith , ben puplis , and folkis , and langagis .

66017017	For God yaf in to the hertis of hem , that thei do that that is pleasaunt to hym , that thei yyue her kyngdom to the beeste , til the wordis of God ben endid .
66017018	And the womman whom thou hast seyn , is the greet citee , that hath kingdom on kyngis of the erthe .
66018001	And aftir these thingis Y siy another aungel comynge doun fro heuene , hauynge greet power ; and the erthe was liytned of his glorie .

66020015	And he that was not foundun writun in the book of lijf , was sent in to the pool of fier .
66021001	And Y sai newe heuene and newe erthe ; for the firste heuene and the firste erthe wenten awei , and the see is not now .
66021002	And Y Joon say the hooli citee Jerusalem , newe , comynge doun fro heuene , maad redi of God , as a wijf ourned to hir hosebonde .

66021005	And he seide , that sat in the trone , Lo ! Y make alle thingis newe . And he seide to me , Write thou , for these wordis ben moost feithful and trewe .
66021006	And he seide to me , It is don ; I am alpha and oo , the bigynnyng and ende . Y schal yyue freli of the welle of quic watir to hym that thirsteth .
66021007	He that schal ouercome , schal welde these things ; and Y schal be God to hym , and he schal be sone to me .
66021008	But to ferdful men , and vnbileueful , and cursid , and manquelleris , and fornycatouris , and to witchis , and worschiperis of idols , and to alle lieris , the part of hem shal be in the pool brennynge with fier and brymstoon , that is the secounde deth .
66021009	And oon cam of the seuene aungels , hauynge violis fulle of ` seuene the laste veniauncis . And he spak with me , and seide , Come thou , and Y schal schewe to thee the spousesse , the wijf of the lomb .

66021014	And the wal of the citee hadde twelue foundementis , and in hem the twelue names of twelue apostlis , and of the lomb .
66021015	And he that spak with me , hadde a goldun mesure of a rehed , that he schulde mete the citee , and the yatis of it , and the wal .
66021016	And the citee was set in square ; and the lengthe of it is so miche , ` as miche as is the breede . And he mat the citee with the rehed , bi furlongis twelue thousyndis . And the heiythe , and the lengthe and breede of it , ben euene .
66021017	And he mat the wallis of it , of an hundrid and ` foure and fourti cubitis , bi mesure of man , that is , of an aungel .
66021018	And the bildyng of the wal therof was of the stoon iaspis . And the citee it silf was clene gold , lijk clene glas .

66021022	And Y say no temple in it , for the Lord God almyyti and the lomb , is temple of it .
66021023	And the citee hath no nede of sunne , nethir moone , that thei schyne in it ; for the clerete of God schal liytne it ; and the lomb is the lanterne of it .
66021024	And folkis schulen walke in liyt of it ; and the kyngis of the erthe schulen brynge her glorie and onour in to it .
