40001023	Beholde a mayde shall be with chylde and shall brynge forthe a sonne and they shall call his name Emanuel which is by interpretacion God with vs .
40001024	And Ioseph assone as he awoke out of slepe did as the angell of the Lorde bade hym and toke hys wyfe vnto hym
40001025	and knewe her not tyll she had brought forth hir fyrst sonne and called hys name Iesus .
40002001	When Iesus was borne at Bethleem in Iury in the tyme of Herode the kynge . Beholde there came wyse me from the eest to Ierusalem
40002002	saynge : Where is he yt is borne kynge of ye Iues ? We have sene his starre in ye eest and are come to worship him .
40002003	When Herode ye kynge had herde thys he was troubled and all Ierusalem with hym
40002004	and he gathered all ye chefe Prestes and Scribes of the people and axed of them where Christ shulde be borne .
40002005	And they sayde vnto hym : at Bethlee in Iury . For thus it is written by the Prophet .
40002006	And thou Bethleem in the londe of Iury art not the leest concernynge the Princes of Iuda . For out of the shall come the captayne that shall govern my people Israhel .
40002007	Then Herod prevely called the wyse men and dyligetly enquyred of them ye tyme of the starre that appered
40002008	and sent the to Bethleem saynge : Goo and searche dyligetly for ye chylde . And when ye have founde hym bringe me worde yt I maye come and worshippe hym also .
40002009	When they had heard the kynge they departed : and lo the starre which they sawe in ye eeste went before them tyll it came and stode over the place where the chylde was .
40002010	When they sawe the starre they were marvelously glad :
40002011	and went into the house and found the chylde with Mary hys mother and kneled doune and worshipped hym and opened their treasures and offred vnto hym gyftes gold frackynsence and myrre .
40002012	And after they were warned of God in a dreame that they shuld not go ageyne to Herod they retourned into their awne countre another waye .
40002013	When they were departed : beholde the angell of the Lorde appered to Ioseph in dreame sayinge : aryse and take the chylde and his mother and flye into Egypte and abyde there tyll I brynge the worde . For Herod will seke the chylde to destroye hym .
40002014	The he arose and toke the chylde and his mother by night and departed into Egypte
40002015	and was there vnto ye deeth of Herod to fulfill that which was spoken of the Lorde by ye Prophet which sayeth out of Egypte haue I called my sonne .
40002016	Then Herod perceavynge yt he was moocked of the wyse men was excedynge wroth and sent forth and slue all the chyldren that were in Bethleem and in all the costes there of as many as were two yere olde and vnder accordynge to the tyme which he had diligetly searched oute of the wyse men .
40002017	Then was fulfilled yt which was spoken by the Prophet Ieremy sayinge :
40002018	On the hilles was a voyce herde mornynge wepynge and greate lamentacion : Rachel wepynge for her chyldren and wolde not be conforted because they were not .

40002020	sayinge : arise and take ye chylde and his mother and go into ye londe of Israel . For they are deed which sought ye chyldes life .

40002022	But whe he hearde yt Archelaus did raygne in Iury in ye roume of his father Herode he was afrayde to goo thither . Not withstondynge after he was warned of god in a dreame he turned a syde into ye parties of Galile
40002023	and wet and dwelt in a cite called Nazareth to fulfill yt which was spoken by ye Prophetes : he shalbe called a Nazarite
40003001	In those dayes Ihon the Baptyst came and preached in the wildernes of Iury
40003002	saynge . Repet the kyngdome of heue is at honde .
40003003	This is he of whom it is spoken by the Prophet Esay which sayeth : The voyce of a cryer in wyldernes prepare the Lordes waye and make hys pathes strayght .
40003004	This Iho had hys garmet of camels heer and a gerdell of a skynne aboute his loynes . Hys meate was locustes and wylde hony .
40003005	The went oute to hym Ierusalem and all Iury and all ye regio roude aboute Iorda
40003006	and were baptised of him in Iorda cofessynge their synnes .
40003007	When he sawe many of ye Pharises and of ye Saduces come to hys baptim he sayde vnto the : O generacio of vipers who hath taught you to fle fro the vengeauce to come ?
40003008	Brynge forth therfore the frutes belongynge to repentauce .
40003009	And se that ye ons thynke not to saye in your selues we haue Abraham to oure father . For I saye vnto you that God is able of these stones to rayse vp chyldern vnto Abraha .
40003010	Euenowe is ye axe put vnto ye rote of ye trees : soo that every tree which bringeth not forthe goode frute is hewe doune and cast into ye fyre .
40003011	I baptise you in water in toke of repentauce : but he ye cometh after me is myghtier then I whose shues I am not worthy to beare . He shall baptise you with ye holy gost and with fyre :
40003012	which hath also his fan in his hod and will pourge his floure and gadre ye wheet into his garner and will burne ye chaffe with vnquecheable fyre
40003013	Then cam Iesus from Galile to Iordan vnto Ihon to be baptised of hym .
40003014	But Ihon forbade hym saynge : I ought to be baptysed of the : and comest thou to me ?
40003015	Iesus answered and sayd to hym : Let it be so now . For thus it becommeth vs to fulfyll all rightwesnes . Then he suffred hym .
40003016	And Iesus assone as he was baptised came strayght out of ye water . And lo heue was ope over hym : and Ihon sawe the spirite of God descende lyke a doue and lyght vpon hym .
40003017	And lo there came a voyce from heven sayng : Thys ys that my beloved sonne in whom is my delyte .
40004001	Then was Iesus ledd awaye of ye spirite into wildernes to be tempted of ye devyll .
40004002	And when he had fasted fourtye dayes and fourtye nightes he was afterward an hungred .
40004003	Then came to hym the tempter and sayde : yf thou be the sonne of God commaunde that these stones be made breed .
40004004	He answered and sayde : yt is wrytten man shall not lyve by brede onlye but by every worde yt proceadeth out of the mouth of God .
40004005	Then the devyll tooke hym vp into ye holy cite and set hym on a pynacle of the teple
40004006	and sayd vnto hym : yf thou be the sonne of God cast thy sylfe doune . For it is wrytte he shall geve his angels charge over the and with their handes they shall holde yt vp that thou dashe not thy fote agaynst a stone .
40004007	And Iesus sayde to hym it ys wrytten also : Thou shalt not tempte thy Lorde God .
40004008	The devyll toke hym vp agayne and ledde hym in to an excedynge hye mountayne and shewed hym all the kyngdomes of ye worlde and all ye glorie of them
40004009	and sayde to hym : all these will I geue ye if thou wilt faull doune and worship me .
40004010	Then sayde Iesus vnto hym . Avoyd Satan . For it is writte thou shalt worshyp ye Lorde thy God and hym only shalt thou serve .
40004011	Then the dyvell left hym and beholde the angels came and ministred vnto hym .
40004012	When Iesus had hearde yt Ihon was taken he departed into Galile
40004013	and left Nazareth and went and dwelte in Capernaum which is a cite apon the see in ye coostes of zabulon and Neptalim
40004014	to fulfill that whiche was spoken by Esay the Prophet sayinge :
40004015	The londe of zabulon and Neptalim the waye of the see beyonde Iordan Galile of the Gentyls
40004016	ye people which sat in darknes sawe greate lyght and to them which sate in the region and shadowe of deeth lyght is begone to shyne .
40004017	From yt tyme Iesus begane to preache and to saye : repet for ye kigdome of heve is at hode .
40004018	As Iesus walked by the see of Galile he sawe two brethren : Simon which was called Peter and Andrew his brother castynge a neet into the see for they were fisshers
40004019	and he sayde vnto them folowe me and I will make you fisshers of men .
40004020	And they strayght waye lefte their nettes and folowed hym .
40004021	And he went forthe from thence and sawe other twoo brethren Iames the sonne of zebede and Ihon his brother in the shippe with zebede their father mendynge their nettes and called them .
40004022	And they with out taryinge lefte the shyp and their father and folowed hym .
40004023	And Iesus went aboute all Galile teachyng in their synagoges and preachynge ye gospell of the kyngdome and healed all maner of sicknes and all maner dyseases amoge ye people .
40004024	And his fame spreed abroode through oute all Siria . And they brought vnto hym all sicke people that were taken with divers diseases and gripinges and them yt were possessed with devils and those which were lunatyke and those that had the palsie : and he healed the .
40004025	And ther folowed hym a greate nombre of people from Galile and from the ten cyties and from Ierusalem and from Iury and from ye regions that lye beyonde Iordan .
40005001	When he sawe the people he went vp into a mountayne and when he was set his disciples came to hym
40005002	and he opened hys mouthe and taught them sayinge :
40005003	Blessed are the povre in sprete : for theirs is the kyngdome of heven .
40005004	Blessed are they that morne : for they shalbe conforted .
40005005	Blessed are the meke : for they shall inheret the erth .
40005006	Blessed are they which honger and thurst for rightewesnes : for they shalbe filled .
40005007	Blessed are ye mercifull : for they shall obteyne mercy .
40005008	Blessed are the pure in herte : for they shall se God .
40005009	Blessed are the peacemakers : for they shalbe called the chyldren of God .
40005010	Blessed are they which suffre persecucio for rightwesnes sake : for theirs ys the kyngdome of heuen .
40005011	Blessed are ye when men reuyle you and persecute you and shall falsly say all manner of yvell saynges agaynst you for my sake .
40005012	Reioyce and be glad for greate is youre rewarde in heven . For so persecuted they ye Prophetes which were before youre dayes .
40005013	ye are ye salt of the erthe : but and yf ye salt have lost hir saltnes what can be salted ther with ? It is thence forthe good for nothynge but to be cast oute and to be troade vnder fote of men .
40005014	Ye are ye light of the worlde . A cite yt is set on an hill cannot be hid
40005015	nether do men lyght a cadell and put it vnder a busshell but on a candelstick and it lighteth all that are in the house .
40005016	Let youre light so shyne before men yt they maye se youre good workes and glorify youre father which is in heven .
40005017	Thinke not yt I am come to destroye the lawe or the Prophets : no I am nott come to destroye them but to fulfyll them .
40005018	For truely I saye vnto you till heven and erth perisshe one iott or one tytle of the lawe shall not scape tyll all be fulfilled .
40005019	Whosoever breaketh one of these lest commaundmentes and teacheth men so he shalbe called the leest in the kyngdome of heve . But whosoever obserueth and teacheth ye same shal be called greate in the kyngdome of heven .
40005020	For I saye vnto you except youre rightewesnes excede the righetewesnes of ye Scribes and Pharises ye canot entre into ye kyngdome of heven .
40005021	Ye have herde howe it was sayd vnto the of ye olde tyme : Thou shalt not kyll . For whoso ever kylleth shall be in daunger of iudgemet .
40005022	But I say vnto you whosoever is angre with hys brother shalbe in daunger of iudgement . Whosoeuer sayeth vnto his brother Racha shalbe in dauger of a cousell . But whosoeuer sayeth thou fole shalbe in dauger of hell fyre .
40005023	Therfore whe thou offrest thy gifte at the altare and their remembrest that thy brother hath ought agaynst the :
40005024	leue there thyne offrynge before the altre and go thy waye first and be reconcyled to thy brother and then come and offre thy gyfte .
40005025	Agre with thyne adversary quicklye whyles thou arte in ye waye with hym lest that adversary deliver ye to ye iudge and ye iudge delivre ye to ye minister and the thou be cast into preson .
40005026	I say vnto ye verely : thou shalt not come out thece till thou have payed ye utmost farthige .
40005027	Ye haue hearde howe it was sayde to the of olde tyme : Thou shalt not comitt advoutrie .
40005028	But I say vnto you that whosoeuer looketh on a wyfe lustynge after her hathe comitted advoutrie with hir alredy in his hert .
40005029	Wherfore yf thy right eye offende ye plucke hym out and caste him from the . Better it is for the yt one of thy membres perisshe then that thy hole bodye shuld be cast into hell .
40005030	Also if thy right honde offend ye cut hym of and caste hym from the . Better yt ys that one of thy membres perisshe then that all thy body shulde be caste in to hell .
40005031	It ys sayd whosoever put awaye his wyfe let hym geve her a testymonyall also of the devorcement .
40005032	But I say vnto you : whosoever put awaye his wyfe ( except it be for fornicacion ) causeth her to breake matrymony . And whosoever maryeth her that is devorsed breaketh wedlocke .
40005033	Agayne ye haue hearde how it was sayd to the of olde tyme thou shalt not forsuere thy selfe but shalt performe thyne othe to God .
40005034	But I saye vnto you swere not at all nether by heue for it ys Goddes seate :
40005035	nor yet by the erth for it is his fote stole : nether by Ierusalem for it ys ye cyte of yt greate kynge :
40005036	nether shalt thou sweare by thy heed because thou canst not make one white heer or blacke :
40005037	But your comunicacion shalbe ye ye : nay nay . For whatsoeuer is more then yt cometh of yvell .
40005038	Ye have hearde how it ys sayd an eye for an eye : a tothe for a tothe .
40005039	But I saye to you that ye resist not wroge . But whosoever geve the a blowe on thy right cheke tourne to him the other .
40005040	And yf eny man will sue the at the lawe and take awaye thy coote let hym have thy cloocke also .
40005041	And whosoever wyll copell the to goo a myle goo wyth him twayne .
40005042	Geve to him that axeth and fro him that wolde borowe tourne not awaye .
40005043	Ye have hearde how it is sayde : thou shalt love thyne neghbour and hate thine enimy .
40005044	But I saye vnto you love youre enimies . Blesse the that coursse you . Do good to them that hate you . Praye for them which doo you wronge and persecute you
40005045	that ye maye be ye chyldern of youre father that is in heauen : for he maketh his sunne to aryse on ye yvell and on the good and sendeth his reyn on the iuste and vniuste .
40005046	For yf ye love them which love you : what rewarde shall ye have ? Doo not the Publicans euen so ?
40005047	And yf ye be frendly to youre brethren onlye : what singuler thynge doo ye ? Do not the Publicans lyke wyse ?
40005048	ye shall therfore be perfecte eve as youre father which is in heauen is perfecte .
40006001	Take hede to youre almes . That ye geve it not in the syght of men to the intent that ye wolde be sene of them . Or els ye get no rewarde of youre father which is in heve .
40006002	Whe soever therfore thou gevest thine almes thou shalt not make a tropet to be blowe before the as ye ypocrites do in the synagogis and in the stretis for to be preysed of men . Verely I say vnto you they have their rewarde .
40006003	But whe thou doest thine almes let not thy lyfte had knowe what thy righte had doth
40006004	yt thine almes may be secret : and thy father which seith in secret shall rewarde ye opely .
40006005	And when thou prayest thou shalt not be as ye ypocrytes are . For they love to stond and praye in the synagoges and in the corners of ye stretes because they wolde be sene of men . Verely I saye vnto you they haue their rewarde .
40006006	But when thou prayest entre into thy chamber and shut thy dore to the and praye to thy father which ys in secrete : and thy father which seith in secret shall rewarde the openly .
40006007	And whe ye praye bable not moche as the hethe do : for they thincke that they shalbe herde for their moche bablynges sake .
40006008	Be ye not lyke them therfore . For youre father knoweth wherof ye haue neade before ye axe of him .
40006009	After thys maner therfore praye ye . O oure father which arte in heve halowed be thy name .
40006010	Let thy kyngdome come . Thy wyll be fulfilled as well in erth as it ys in heven .
40006011	Geve vs this daye oure dayly breede .
40006012	And forgeve vs oure treaspases eve as we forgeve oure trespacers .
40006013	And leade vs not into teptacion : but delyver vs fro evell . For thyne is ye kyngedome and ye power and ye glorye for ever . Amen .
40006014	For and yf ye shall forgeve other men their treaspases youre hevenly father shall also forgeve you .
40006015	But and ye wyll not forgeve men their trespases nomore shall youre father forgeve youre treaspases .
40006016	Moreoure when ye faste be not sad as ye ypocrytes are . For they disfigure their faces that they myght be sene of me how they faste . Verely I say vnto you they have their rewarde .
40006017	But thou whe thou fastest annoynte thyne heed and washe thy face
40006018	that it appere not vnto men howe that thou fastest : but vnto thy father which is in secrete : and thy father which seeth in secret shall rewarde the openly .
40006019	Se that ye gaddre you not treasure vpon ye erth where rust and mothes corrupte and where theves breake through and steale .
40006020	But gaddre ye treasure togeder in heve where nether rust nor mothes corrupte and where theves nether breake vp nor yet steale .
40006021	For where soever youre treasure ys there will youre hertes be also .
40006022	The light of the body is thyne eye . Wher fore if thyne eye besyngle all thy body shalbe full of light .
40006023	But and if thyne eye be wycked then all thy body shalbe full of derckenes . Wherfore yf the light that is in the be darckenes : how greate is that darckenes .
40006024	No ma can serve two masters . For ether he shall hate the one and love the other : or els he shall lene to ye one and despise ye other : ye can not serve God and mammon .
40006025	Therfore I saye vnto you be not carefull for your lyfe what ye shall eate or what ye shall drincke nor yet for youre body what ye shall put on . ys not ye lyfe more worth then meate and the body more of value then raymeut ?
40006026	Beholde the foules of ye ayer : for they sowe not nether reepe nor yet cary into ye barnes : and yet youre hevely father fedeth the . Are ye not moche better the they ?
40006027	Which of you ( though he toke thought therfore ) coulde put one cubit vnto his stature ?
40006028	And why care ye then for raymet ? Considre ye lylies of ye felde how they growe . They labour not nether spynne .
40006029	And yet for all yt I saye vnto you yt eue Salomon in all his royalte was not arayed lyke vnto one of these .
40006030	Wherfore yf God so clothe the grasse which ys to daye in the felde and to morowe shalbe caste in to the fournace : shall he not moche more do the same vnto you o ye of lytle fayth ?
40006031	Therfore take no thought sayinge : what shall we eate or what shall we drincke or wherwt shall we be clothed ?
40006032	After all these thynges seke the getyls . For youre hevely father knoweth that ye have neade of all these thynges .
40006033	But rather seke ye fyrst the kyngdome of heuen and the rightwisnes therof and all these thynges shalbe ministred vnto you .
40006034	Care not then for the morow but let ye morow care for it selfe : for the daye present hath ever ynough of his awne trouble .
40007001	Iudge not that ye be not iudged .
40007002	For as ye iudge so shall ye be iudged . And wt what mesure ye mete wt the same shall it be mesured to you agayne .
40007003	Why seist thou a moote in thy brothers eye and perceavest not the beame yt ys yn thyne awne eye .
40007004	Or why sayest thou to thy brother : suffre me to plucke oute the moote oute of thyne eye and behold a beame is in thyne awne eye .
40007005	Ypocryte fyrst cast oute the beame oute of thyne awne eye and then shalte thou se clearly to plucke oute the moote out of thy brothers eye .
40007006	Geve not that which is holy to dogges nether cast ye youre pearles before swyne lest they treade them vnder their fete and ye other tourne agayne and all to rent you .
40007007	Axe and it shalbe geven you . Seke and ye shall fynd . knocke and it shalbe opened vnto you .
40007008	For whosoever axeth receaveth and he yt seketh fyndeth and to hym that knocketh it shalbe opened .
40007009	Ys there eny man amoge you which if his sonne axed hym bread wolde offer him astone ?
40007010	Or if he axed fysshe wolde he proffer hym a serpet ?
40007011	Yf ye then which are evyll cane geve to youre chyldren good gyftes : how moche moore shall youre father which is in heve geve good thynges to them yt axe hym ?
40007012	Therfore whatsoever ye wolde that men shulde do to you even so do ye to them . This ys the lawe and the Prophettes .
40007013	Enter in at the strayte gate : for wyde is ye gate and broade is the waye that leadeth to destruccion : and many ther be which goo yn therat .
40007014	But strayte is the gate and narowe ys the waye which leadeth vnto lyfe : and feawe there be that fynde it .
40007015	Beware of false Prophetes which come to you in shepes clothinge but inwardly they are ravenynge wolves .
40007016	Ye shall knowe them by their frutes . Do men gaddre grapes of thornes ? or figges of bryres ?
40007017	Euen soo every good tree bryngeth forthe good frute . But a corrupte tree bryngethe forthe evyll frute .
40007018	A good tree canot brynge forthe bad frute : nor yet a bad tree can bringe forthe good frute .
40007019	Every tree that bryngethe not forthe good frute shalbe hewe doune and cast into the fyre .
40007020	Wherfore by their frutes ye shall knowe the .
40007021	Not all they that saye vnto me Master Master shall enter in to the kyngdome of heven : but he that dothe my fathers will which ys in heven .
40007022	Many will saye to me in that daye Master master have we not in thy name prophesied ? And in thy name have caste oute devyls ? And in thy name have done many miracles ?
40007023	And then will I knowlege vnto them that I never knewe them . Departe from me ye workers of iniquite .
40007024	Whosoever heareth of me these sayinges and doethe the same I wyll lyken hym vnto a wyse man which bylt hys housse on a rocke :
40007025	and aboundance of rayne descended and the fluddes came and the wyndes blewe and bet vpon that same housse and it fell not because it was grounded on the rocke .
40007026	And whosoever heareth of me these sayinges and doth the not shalbe lykened vnto a folysh man which bilt hys housse apo the sondes :
40007027	and abundauce of rayne descended and the fluddes came and ye wyndes blewe and beet vpon that housse and it fell and great was the fall of it .
40007028	And it came to passe that when Iesus had ended these saynges the people were astonnyed at hys doctryne .
40007029	For he taught them as one havynge power and not as the Scribes .
40008001	When he was come downe from the moutayne moch people folowed him .
40008002	And lo ther came a lepre and worsheped him sayinge : Master if thou wylt thou canst make me clene .
40008003	And Iesus put forthe hys hond and touched hym sayinge : I wyll be thou clene and immediatly hys leprosie was clensed .
40008004	And Iesus sayde vnto him . Se thou tell no man but go and shewe thy selfe to the preste and offer the gyfte that Moses comaunded in witnes to them .
40008005	When Iesus was entred into Capernau ther came vnto him a certayne Centurion and besought hym
40008006	sayinge : Master my seruaunt lyeth sicke at home of ye palsye and ys greuously payned .
40008007	And Iesus sayd vnto hym : I will come and heale him .
40008008	The Centurio answered and sayde : Syr I am not worthy yt thou shuldest come vnder my rofe but speake ye worde only and my servaut shalbe healed .
40008009	For I also my selfe am a man vndre power and have sowdiers vndre me and I saye to one go and he goeth and to anothre come and he cometh : and to my seruaut do this and he doeth it .
40008010	When Iesus hearde yt he marveled and sayd to them yt folowed hym . Derely I say vnto you I have not foude so great fayth : no not in Israel .
40008011	I say therfore vnto you that many shall come fro the eest and weest and shall rest wt Abraham Isaac and Iacob in the kingdome of heve :
40008012	and the chyldren of ye kyngdome shalbe cast out in to vtter darcknes : there shalbe wepinge and gnasshing of tethe .
40008013	The Iesus sayd vnto ye Centurion go thy waye and as thou belevest so be it vnto the . And his servaunt was healed the selfe houre .
40008014	And then Iesus went to Peters housse and sawe hys wyves mother lyinge sicke of a fevre
40008015	and touched her hande and the fevre left hir : and she arose and ministred vnto them .
40008016	When the eue was come they brought vn to him many yt were possessed with devyllis . And he cast out ye spirites with a worde and healed all yt were sicke
40008017	to fulfill yt which was spoke by Esayas ye Prophet sayinge . He toke on him oure infirmities and bare oure sickneses .
40008018	Whe Iesus sawe moche people about him he comaunded to go over ye water .
40008019	And ther came a scribe and sayd vnto hym : master I wyll folowe ye whyther so ever thou goest .
40008020	And Iesus sayd vnto him : the foxes have holes and the bryddes of the ayer have nestes but ye sonne of the man hath not whero to rest his heede .
40008021	A nothre yt was one of hys disciples sayd vnto hym : master suffre me fyrst to go and burye my father .
40008022	But Iesus sayd vnto him : folowe me and let the deed burie their deed .
40008023	And he entred in to a shyppe and his disciples folowed him .
40008024	And beholde there arose a a greate tepest in ye see in so moche yt the shippe was covered wt waves and he was a slepe .
40008025	And his disciples came vn to him and awoke hym sayinge : master save vs we perishe .
40008026	And he sayd vnto them : why are ye fearfull o ye of lytell faithe ? Then he arose and rebuked ye wyndes and the see and ther folowed a greate calme .
40008027	And the men marveyled and sayd : what man is this that bothe wyndes and see obey hym ?
40008028	And when he was come to ye other syde in to ye coutre of ye Gergesites ther met him two possessed of devylles which came out of the graves and were out of measure fearce so yt no ma myght go by that waye .
40008029	And behold they cryed out sayinge : O Iesu the sonne of God what have we to do with the ? Art thou come hyther to tormet vs before the tyme be come ?
40008030	And ther was a good waye of fro them a greate heerd of swyne fedinge .
40008031	Then ye devyles besought him sayinge : if thou cast vs out suffre vs to go oure waye in to the heerd of swyne .
40008032	And he sayd vnto the : go youre wayes . Then wet they out and departed into ye heerd of swyne And beholde ye whoale heerd of swyne was caryed wt violence hedlinge in to the see and perisshed in ye water .
40008033	Then ye heerdme fleed and wet their ways in to ye cyte and tolde every thinge and what had fortuned vnto the possessed of the devyls .
40008034	And beholde all the cyte came out and met Iesus . And when they sawe hym they besought hym to departe oute of their costes .
40009001	Then he entred in to a shippe and passed over and came in to his awne cite .
40009002	And lo they brought to him a ma sicke of ye palsie lyinge in his bed . And when Iesus sawe ye faith of the he sayd to the sicke of ye palsie : sonne be of good chere thy sinnes be forgeve the .
40009003	And beholde certeyne of ye scribes sayd in the selves this ma blasphemeth .
40009004	And whe Iesus sawe their thoughtes he sayd : wherfore thinke ye evill in youre hertes ?
40009005	Whether ys esyer to saye thy synnes be forgeven ye or to saye : arise and walke ?
40009006	That ye maye knowe that ye sonne of ma hath power to forgeve sinnes in erth then sayd he vnto ye sicke of ye palsye : arise take vp thy beed and go home to thine housse .
40009007	And he arose and departed to his awne housse .
40009008	And when ye people sawe it they marveyled and glorified god which had geve suche power to me .
40009009	And as Iesus passed forth fro thence he sawe a ma syt a receyuinge of custome named Mathew and sayd to him : folowe me .
40009010	And he arose and folowed him . And it came to passe as he sat at meate in the housse : beholde many publicans and synners came and sate downe also with Iesus and hys disciples .
40009011	When the Pharises sawe that they sayd to hys disciples : why eateth youre master wt publicans and synners ?
40009012	When Iesus herde that he sayde vnto them : The whole neade not the phisicion but they that are sicke .
40009013	Goo and learne what that meaneth : I have pleasure in mercy and not in offerynge . For I am not come to call the rightewes but the synners to repentaunce .
40009014	Then came ye disciples of Ihon to hym sayinge : why do we and the Pharises fast ofte : but thy disciples fast not ?
40009015	And Iesus sayde vnto them : Can ye weddynge chyldren morne as longe as ye bridegrome is wt them ? The tyme will come whe the bridegrome shalbe take fro them and then shall they faste .
40009016	Noo man peceth and olde garment with a pece of newe cloothe . For then taketh he awaye ye pece agayne from the garmet and the rent ys made greater .
40009017	Nether do men put newe wyne into olde vessels for then the vessels breake and the wyne runneth oute and the vessels perysshe . But they powre newe wyne into newe vessels and so are both saved togeder .
40009018	Whyls he thus spake vnto the beholde ther came a certayne ruler and worshipped him sayinge : my doghter is euen now deceased but come and lay thy honde on her and she shall live .
40009019	And Iesus arose and folowed hym with hys disciples .
40009020	And beholde a woman which was diseased wt an yssue of bloude . xii . yeres came behynde hym and toched ye hem of hys vesture .
40009021	For she sayd in her silfe : yf I maye toche but even his vesture only I shalbe safe .
40009022	Then Iesus tourned him about and behelde her sayinge : Doughter be of good conforte thy faith hath made the safe . And she was made whole even that same houre .
40009023	And when Iesus came into ye rulers housse and sawe the minstrels and the people raginge
40009024	he sayde vnto them : Get you hence for ye mayde is not deed but slepeth . And they laughed hym to scorne .
40009025	Assone as ye people were put forthe he went in and toke her by ye hond and the mayde arose .
40009026	And this was noysed through out all that lande .
40009027	And as Iesus departed thence two blynde men folowed hym crying and saying : O thou sonne of David have mercy on vs .
40009028	And when he was come to housse the blynd came to hym And Iesus sayde vnto them : Beleve ye that I am able to do thys ? And they sayde vnto hym : ye Lorde .
40009029	Then touched he their eyes saying : acordynge to youre faythe be it vnto you .
40009030	And their eyes were opened . And Iesus charged the saying : Se yt no man knowe of it .
40009031	But they assone as they were departed spreed abroade his name through oute all the londe .
40009032	As they went out beholde they brought to hym a dome ma possessed af a devyll .
40009033	And as sone as the devyll was cast oute the domme spake : And the people merveled sayinge : it was never so sene in Israel .
40009034	But the Pharises sayde : he casteth oute devyls by the power of the chefe devyll .
40009035	And Iesus went about all cities and tounes teachynge in their synagoges and preachyng the glad tidinges of ye kyngdome and healinge all maner sicknes and desease amoge ye people .
40009036	But when he sawe the people he had copassion on the because they were pyned awaye and scattered abroade eve as shepe havige no shepherd .
40009037	Then sayde he to hys disciples : the hervest is greate but the laborers are feawe .
40009038	Wherfore praye the Lorde of the harvest to sende forthe laborers into hys harvest .
40010001	And he called his . xii . disciples vnto hym and gave them power over vnclene sprites to cast them oute and to heale all maner of sicknesses and all maner of deseases .
40010002	The names of the . xii . Apostles are these . The fyrst Simon called also Peter : and Andrew his brother . Iames the sonne of zebede aud Ihon his brother .
40010003	Philip and Bartlemew . Thomas and Mathew the Publican . Iames the sonne of Alphe and Lebbeus otherwyse called Taddeus .
40010004	Simon of Cane and Iudas Iscarioth which also betrayed hym .
40010005	These . xii . sent Iesus and comaunded them sayinge : Go not in to ye wayes yt leade to the gentyls and in to ye cities of ye Samaritans enter ye not .
40010006	But go rather to ye lost shepe of the housse of Israel .
40010007	Go and preach sayinge : yt the kyngdome of heve is at hande .
40010008	Heale the sicke clense the lepers rayse the deed caste oute the devils . Frely ye have receved frely geve agayne .
40010009	Posses not golde nor silver nor brassse yn youre gerdels
40010010	nor yet scrip towardes your iorney : nether two cotes nether shues nor yet a staffe . For the workma is worthy to have his meate .
40010011	In to whatsoever cite or toune ye shall come enquyre who ys worthy yn it and there abyde till ye goo thence .
40010012	And whe ye come in to an housse salute ye same .
40010013	And yf the housse be worthy youre peace shall come apon it . But yf it be not worthy youre peace shall retourne to you agayne .
40010014	And whosoever shall not receave you nor will heare youre preachynge : when ye departe oute of yt housse or that cite shake of the duste of youre fete .
40010015	Truly I say vnto you : it shalbe easier for the londe of zodoma and Gomorra in the daye of iudgement then for that cite .
40010016	Beholde I sende you forthe as shepe amoge wolves . Be ye therfore wyse as serpetes and innocent as doves .
40010017	Beware of men for they shall deliver you vp to ye cousels and shall scourge you in their synagoges .
40010018	And ye shall be brought to the heed rulers and kynges for my sake in witnes to them and to the gentyls .
40010019	But when they delyver you vp take no thought how or what ye shall speake for yt shalbe geve you eve in that same houre what ye shall saye .
40010020	For it is not ye that speke but ye sprite of your father which speaketh in you .
40010021	The brother shall betraye the brother to deeth and the father the sonne . And the chyldre shall aryse agaynste their fathers and mothers and shall put them to deethe :
40010022	and ye shall be hated of all me for my name . But he that endureth to the ende shalbe saved .
40010023	When they persecute you in one cite flye in to another . I tell you for a treuth ye shall not fynysshe all yt cities of Israel tyll ye sonne of man be come .
40010024	The disciple ys not above hys master : nor yet ye servaut above his lorde .
40010025	It is ynough for the disciple to be as hys master ys and that the servaunt be as his lorde ys . yf they have called the lorde of the housse beelzebub : how moche more shall they call them of his housholde so ?
40010026	Feare the not therfore . There is no thinge so close that shall not be openned and no thinge so hyd that shall not be knowen .
40010027	What I tell you in dercknes that speake ye in lyght . And what ye heare in the eare that preache ye on the housse toppes .
40010028	And feare ye not them which kyll the body and be not able to kyll the soule . But rather feare hym which is able to destroye bothe soule and body into hell .
40010029	Are not two sparowes solde for a farthinge ? And none of them dothe lyght on the grounde with out youre father .
40010030	And now are all the heeris of youre heedis numbred .
40010031	Feare ye not therfore : ye are of more value then many sparowes .
40010032	Who soever therfore shall knowledge me before men hym will I knowledge also before my father which is in heuen .
40010033	But whoso ever shall denye me before men hym will I also denye before my father which is in heven .
40010034	Thynke not that I am come to sende peace into the erth . I came not to send peace but a swearde .
40010035	For I am come to set a man at varyaunce ageynst hys father and the doughter ageynst hyr mother and the doughterlawe ageynst her motherlawe :
40010036	And a mannes fooes shalbe they of hys owne housholde .
40010037	He that lovith hys father or mother more then me is not mete for me . And he that loveth his sonne or doughter more then me is not mete for me .
40010038	And he yt taketh not his crosse and foloweth me ys not mete for me .
40010039	He that fyndeth hys lyfe shall lose it : and he that losith hys lyfe for my sake shall fynde it .
40010040	He that receavith you receavith me : and he that receavith me receavith him that sent me .
40010041	He that receavith a prophet in ye name of a prophet shall receave a prophetes rewarde . And he that receavith a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receave the rewarde of a righteous man .
40010042	And whosoever shall geve vnto one of these lytle ones to drincke a cuppe of colde water only in the name of a disciple : I tel you of a trueth he shall not lose his rewarde .
40011001	And it came to passe when Iesus had made an ende of comaundinge his . xii . disciples that he departed thence to teache and to preache in their cities .
40011002	When Ihon beinge in preson hearde ye workes of Christ he sent two of his disciples
40011003	and sayde vnto him . Arte thou he that shall come : or shall we loke for another .
40011004	Iesus answered and sayde vnto them . Go and shewe Ihon what ye have hearde and sene .
40011005	The blynd se the halt goo the lepers are clensed : the deef heare the ded ryse ageyne and the glad tidinges is preached to the povre .
40011006	And happy is he that is not offended by me .
40011007	And as they departed Iesus begane to speake vnto the people of Ihon . What for to se wet ye out in to the wyldernes ? wet ye out to se a rede shake with ye wynde ?
40011008	other what wet ye out for to se ? A man clothed in soofte raymet : ? Beholde they yt weare soofte clothig are in kynges howses .
40011009	But what wet ye oute for to se ? A prophete ? Ye I saye to you and more the a prophete .
40011010	For this is he of who it is wrytte . Beholde I sende my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy waye before ye .
40011011	Verely I saye vnto you amonge ye chyldren of wemen arose there not a gretter then Ihon the baptist . Notwithstondinge he that ys lesse in the kyngdome of heven ys gretter then he .
40011012	From the tyme of Ihon Baptist hytherto ye kyngdome of heve suffreth violence and they that go to it with violence pluck it vnto them .
40011013	For all the prophetes and the lawe prophesyed vnto to the tyme of Ihon .
40011014	Also yf ye wyll receave it this is Helyas which shuld come .
40011015	He yt hathe eares to heare let him heare .
40011016	But wher vnto shall I lyken this generacion ? It ys lyke vnto chyldre which syt in the market and call vnto their felowes
40011017	and saye : we have pyped vnto you and ye have not daunsed ? We have morned vnto you and ye have not sorowed .
40011018	For Ihon came nether eatinge nor drinkinge and they saye he hath the devyll .
40011019	The sonne of man came eatinge and drinkinge and they saye beholde a glutton and drynker of wyne and a frend vnto publicas and synners . Never the later wysdome ys iustified of hir children .
40011020	Then bega he to vpbrayd the cities in which most of his miracles were done because they meded not .
40011021	Wo be to ye Chorasin . Wo be to ye Betzaida : for if the miracles which were shewd in you had bene done in Tyre and Sidon they had repented longe agone in sackcloth and asshes .
40011022	Neverthelesse I say to you : it shall be esier for Tyre and Sidon at the day of iudgemet then for you .
40011023	And thou Capernau which art lift vp vnto heve shalt be brought doune to hell . For if the miracles which have bene done in the had bene shewed in zodom : they had remayned to this daye .
40011024	Neverthelesse I saye vnto you : it shalbe easiar for ye londe of zodo in the daye of iudgemet the for ye .
40011025	At yt tyme Iesus answered and sayd : I prayse ye o father lorde of heve and erth because thou hast hid these thinges fro the wyse and prudet and hast opened the vnto babes :
40011026	eve so father for so it pleased ye .
40011027	All thinges are geve vnto me of my father . And noma knoweth ye sonne but ye father : nether knoweth eny ma ye father save ye sonne and he to whome ye sonne will ope him .
40011028	Come vnto me all ye that laboure and are laden and I wyll ease you .
40011029	Take my yoke on you and lerne of me for I am meke and lowly in herte : and ye shall fynd rest vnto youre soules .
40011030	For my yoke is easy and my burden is light .
40012001	In that tyme went Iesus on the Sabot dayes thorow the corne and his disciples were anhogred and begane to plucke the eares of coorne and to eate .
40012002	When ye pharises sawe that they sayde vnto him : Beholde thy disciples do that which is not lawfull to do apon ye saboth daye .
40012003	He sayde vnto the : Haue ye not reed what David did whe he was anhougered and they also which were with him ?
40012004	How he entred into the housse of God and ate ye halowed loves which were not lawfull for him to eate nether for the which were wt him but only for ye prestes .
40012005	Or have ye not reed in ye lawe how that ye prestes in ye temple breake the saboth daye and yet are blamlesse ?
40012006	But I saye vnto you : that here is one greater then ye teple .
40012007	Wherfore yf ye had wist what this sayinge meneth : I require mercy and not sacrifice : ye wold never have condened innocetes .
40012008	For ye sonne of man is lord even of ye saboth daye .
40012009	And he departed thence and went into their synagoge :
40012010	and beholde ther was a man whiche had his hande dryed vp . And they axed him sayinge : ys it lawfull to heale apon ye saboth dayes ? because they myght acuse him .
40012011	And he sayde vnto the : whiche of you wolde it be yf he had a shepe fallen into a pitte on ye saboth daye that wolde not take him and lyft him out ?
40012012	And how moche is a man better the a shepe ? Wherfore it is lefull to do a good dede on the saboth dayes .
40012013	Then sayde he to ye ma : stretch forth thy had . And he stretched it forthe . And it was made whole agayne lyke vnto ye other .
40012014	Then ye Pharyses wet out and helde a cousell agaynst hym how they myght destroye hym .
40012015	When Iesus knewe yt he departed thece and moche people folowed him and he healed the all
40012016	and charged the that they shuld not make him knowe :
40012017	to fulfyll that which was spoden by Esay ye Prophet which sayeth .
40012018	Beholde my chylde who I have chosen my beloved in who my soule deliteth . I wyll put my sprete on hym and he shall shewe iudgemet to ye gentyls .
40012019	He shall not stryve he shall not crye nether shall eny man heare his voyce in ye streetes
40012020	a brosed rede shall he not breacke and flaxe that begynneth to burne he shall not queche tyll he sende forth iudgement vnto victory
40012021	and in hys name shall the gentyls truste .
40012022	Then was brought to hym one possessed with a devyll which was both blynde and domme : and he healed hym insomoch that he which was blynd and domme both spake and sawe .
40012023	And all the people were amased and sayde : Ys not this that sonne of David ?
40012024	But when the Pharises hearde that they sayde : This felow dryveth ye devyls no nother wyse oute but by the helpe of Belzebub ye chefe of the devyls .
40012025	But Iesus knewe their thoughtes and sayde to the . Every kingdome devided wt in it sylfe shalbe brought to naught . Nether shall eny cite or housholde devyded agest it sylfe cotynue .
40012026	So if sata cast out sata the is he devyded agenst him sylfe . How shall then his kyngdome endure ?
40012027	Also if I by ye helpe of Belzebub cast oute devyls : by whose helpe do youre chyldren cast them out ? Therfore they shalbe youre iudges .
40012028	But if I cast out the devyls by the sprite of God : then is the kyngdome of god come on you ?
40012029	Ether how can a ma enter into a stroge manes housse and violently take awaye his goodes : excepte he fyrst binde ye stroge man and the spoyle his housse ?
40012030	He that is not wt me is agaynst me . And he yt gaddereth not wt me scattereth abrode .
40012031	Wherfore I say vnto you all maner of synne and blasphemy shalbe forgeven vnto men : but the blasphemy of ye sprite shall not be forgeven vnto men .
40012032	And whoso ever speaketh a worde agaynst the sonne of man it shalbe forgeven him . But whosoever speaketh agaynst the holy goost it shall not be forgeven hym : no nether in this worlde nether in the worlde to come .
40012033	Ether make ye tree good and his frute good also : or els make ye tree evyll and his frute evyll also . For ye tree is knowe by his frute .
40012034	O generacio of viperes how can ye saye well whe ye youre selves are evyll ? For of ye aboundace of the hert ye mouthe speaketh .
40012035	A good ma oute of ye good treasure of his hert bringeth forth good thynges . And an evyll man out of his evyll treasure bringeth forth evyll thinges .
40012036	But I say vnto you that of every ydell worde that men shall have spoken : they shall geve acountes at the daye of iudgement .
40012037	For by thy wordes thou shalt be iustifyed : and by thy wordes thou shalt be condemned .
40012038	Then answered certeyne of the scribes and of the Pharises sayinge : Master we wolde fayne se a sygne of ye .
40012039	He answered and sayde to the : The evyll and advoutrous generacio seketh a signe but ther shall no signe be geve to the saue the signe of the Prophete Ionas .
40012040	For as Ionas was thre dayes and thre nyghtes in the whales belly : soo shall ye sonne of man be thre dayes and thre nyghtes in ye hert of ye erth .
40012041	The men of Ninivie shall rise at the daye of iugdement with this nacion and condemne them : for they amended at ye preachinge of Ionas . And beholde a greater then Ionas is here .
40012042	The quene of ye south shall ryse at ye daye of iudgement with this generacion and shall condemne the : for she came fro the vtmost parties of the worlde to heare the wysdome of Salomon . And beholde a greater then Salomo is here .
40012043	When the vnclene sprite is gone out of a man he walketh throughout dry places seking reest and fyndeth none .
40012044	Then he sayeth : I will retourne ageyne into my housse fro whece I came oute . And when he is come he fyndeth the housse empty and swepte and garnisshed .
40012045	Then he goeth his waye and taketh vnto him seven other spretes worsse then himsilfe and so entre they in and dwell there . And the ende of that man is worsse then the beginning . Even so shall it be with this evell nacion .
40012046	Whill he yet talked to the people : beholde his mother and his brethren stode without desyringe to speake with him .
40012047	Then one sayde vnto hym : beholde thy mother and thy brethre stonde without desiringe to speke wt the .
40012048	He answered and sayd to him that tolde hym : Who is my mother ? or who are my brethren ?
40012049	And he stretched forth his hond over his disciples and sayd : behold my mother and my brethren .
40012050	For whosoever dothe my fathers will which is in heve the same is my brother suster and mother .
40013001	The same daye wet Iesus out of ye house and sat by the seesyde
40013002	and moch people resorted vnto him so gretly yt he wet and sat in a shippe and all the people stode on ye shoore .
40013003	And he spake many thynges to the in similitudes sayinge : Beholde ye sower wet forth to sowe .
40013004	And as he sowed some fell by ye wayessyde and the fowlles came and devoured it vp .
40013005	Some fell apo stony groude where it had not moche erth and a none it sproge vp because it had no depth of erth :
40013006	and when ye sunne was vp it cauht heet and for lake of rotynge wyddred awaye .
40013007	Some fell amoge thornes and the thornes sproge vp and chooked it .
40013008	Parte fell in good groud and brought forth good frute : some an hudred fold some sixtie fold some thyrty folde .
40013009	Whosoever hath eares to heare let him heare .
40013010	And the disciples came and sayde to him : Why speakest thou to the in parables ?
40013011	He answered and sayde vnto them : it is geve vnto you to knowe ye secretes of the kyngdome of heve but to the it is not geve .
40013012	For whosoever hath to him shall be geven : and he shall have aboundance . But whosoever hath not : fro hym shalbe takyn awaye even that he hath .
40013013	Therfore speake I to them in similitudes : for though they se they se not : and hearinge they heare not : nether vnderstonde .
40013014	And in the is fulfilled ye Prophesie of Esayas which prophesie sayth : with the eares ye shall heare and shall not vnderstonde and with the eyes ye shall se and shall not perceave .
40013015	For this peoples hertes are wexed grosse and their eares were dull of herynge and their eyes have they closed lest they shulde se with their eyes and heare with their eares and shuld vnderstonde with their hertes and shuld tourne that I myght heale them .
40013016	But blessed are youre eyes for they se : and youre eares for they heare .
40013017	Verely I say vnto you that many Prophetes and perfaicte me have desired to se tho thinges which ye se and have not sene the : and to heare tho thinges which ye heare and have not herde the .
40013018	Heare ye therfore ye similitude of the sower .
40013019	Whosoever heareth the worde of ye kingdome and vnderstondeth it not ther cometh the evyll ma and catcheth awaye yt which was sowne in his hert . And this is he which was sowne by the wayesyde .
40013020	But he yt was sowne in ye stony groude is he which heareth the worde of God and anone wt ioye receaveth it
40013021	yet hath he no rottes in him selfe and therfore dureth but a season : for assone as tribulacion or persecucion aryseth because of the worde by and by he falleth .
40013022	He yt was sowne amoge thornes is he yt heareth ye worde of God : but the care of this worlde and the dissaytfulnes of ryches choke ye worde and so is he made vnfrutfull .
40013023	He which is sowne in ye good grounde is he yt heareth ye worde and vnderstodeth it which also bereth frute and bringeth forth some an . C . folde some sixtie folde and some . xxx . folde .
40013024	Another similitude put he forth vnto the sayinge : The kyngdome of heve is lyke vnto a man which sowed good seed in his felde .
40013025	But whyll men slepte ther came his foo and sowed tares amoge ye wheate and wet his waye .
40013026	When ye blade was sproge vp and had brought forth frute the appered ye tares also .
40013027	The servauntes came to the housholder and sayde vnto him : Syr sowedest not thou good seed in thy closse fro whece the hath it tares ?
40013028	He sayde to the the envious ma hath done this . Then ye servauntes sayde vnto him : wilt thou then yt we go and gader them ?
40013029	But he sayde nay lest whill ye go aboute to wede out ye tares ye plucke vppe also wt them ye wheate by ye rottes :
40013030	let bothe growe to gether tyll harvest come and in tyme of harvest I wyll saye to the repers gather ye fyrst ye tares and bind the in sheves to be bret : but gather the wheete into my barne .
40013031	Another parable he put forthe vnto the sayinge . The kyngdome of heve is lyke vnto a grayne of mustard seed which a ma taketh and soweth in his felde
40013032	which is ye leest of all seedes . But when it is groune it is the greatest amoge yerbes and it is a tree : so yt the bryddes of the ayer come and bylde in the brauches of it .
40013033	Another similitude sayde he to them . The kyngdome of heven is lyke vnto leve which a woman taketh and hydeth in . iii . peckes of meele tyll all be levended .
40013034	All these thynge spake Iesus vnto the people by similitudes and with oute similitudes spake he nothinge to them
40013035	to fulfyll that which was spoke by the Prophet sayinge : I wyll ope my mouth in similitudes and wyll speake forth thinges which have bene kepte secrete from the begynninge of the worlde .
40013036	Then sent Iesus ye people awaye and came to housse . And his disciples came vnto him sayinge : declare vnto vs the similitude of the tares of the felde .
40013037	Then answered he and sayde to them . He that soweth the good seed is the sonne of man .
40013038	And ye felde is the worlde . And the chyldre of the kingdome they are ye good seed . And the tares are the chyldren of ye wicked .
40013039	And the enemye that soweth the is ye devell . The harvest is ye end of the worlde . And the repers be ye angels .
40013040	For eve as the tares are gaddred and bret in ye fyre : so shall it be in ye ende of this worlde .
40013041	The sonne of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kyngdome all thinges that offende and them which do iniquite
40013042	and shall cast them into a furnes of fyre . There shalbe waylynge and gnasshing of teth .
40013043	Then shall the iuste men shyne as bryght as the sunne in ye kyngdome of their father . Whosoever hath eares to heare let him heare .
40013044	Agayne ye kyngdome of heve is lyke vnto treasure hidde in the felde ye which a man fyndeth and hideth : and for ioy therof goeth and selleth all that he hath and byeth that felde .
40013045	Agayne ye kyngdome of heve is lyke vnto a marchaunt that seketh good pearles
40013046	which when he had founde one precious pearle wet and solde all that he had and bought it .
40013047	Agayne the kyngdome of heve is lyke vnto a neet cast into ye see yt gadereth of all kyndes of fysshes :
40013048	which whe it is full men drawe to londe and sitte and gadre the good into vessels and cast the bad awaye .
40013049	So shall it be at the ende of the worlde . The angels shall come oute and sever the bad from the good
40013050	and shall cast them into a furnes of fyre : there shalbe waylinge and gnasshynge of teth .
40013051	Iesus sayde vnto them : vnderstonde ye all these thynges ? They sayde ye Lorde .
40013052	The sayde he vnto them : Therfore every scribe which is taught vnto the kyngdome of heve is lyke an housholder which bryngeth forth out of hys treasure thynges bothe new and olde .
40013053	And it came to passe when Iesus had finisshed these similitudes yt he departed thece
40013054	and came in to his awne coutre and taught them in their synagoges in so moche yt they were astonyed and sayde : whece cometh all this wysdome and power vnto him ?
40013055	Is not this the carpeters sonne ? Is not his mother called Mary ? and his brethre be called Iames and Ioses and Simo and Iudas ?
40013056	And are not his susters all here wt vs ? Whece hath he all these thynge .
40013057	And they were offended by him . The Iesus sayd to the a Prophet is not wt out honoure save in hys awne countre and amoge his awne kynne .
40013058	And he dyd not many miracles there for there vnbelefes sake .
40014001	At that tyme Herod the tetrarcha hearde of the fame of Iesu
40014002	and sayde vnto his servautes : This is Ihon ye baptist . He is risen agayne from deeth and therfore are soche myracles wrought by him .
40014003	For Herod had taken Ihon and bounde him and put him in preson for Herodias sake his brother Philips wyfe .
40014004	For Ihon sayde vnto him : Yt is not lawfull for the to have her .
40014005	And when he wold have put him to deeth he feared the people because they counted him as a prophet .
40014006	But when Herodes birth daye was come the doughter of Herodias daunsed before them and pleased Herod .
40014007	Wherfore he promised wt an oth that he wolde geve hir whatsoever she wolde axe .
40014008	And she beinge informed of her mother before sayde : geve me here Ihon baptistes heed in a platter .
40014009	And ye kynge sorowed . Neverthelesse for his othes sake and for their sakis which sate also at ye table he comaunded yt to be geven hir :
40014010	and sent and beheeded Ihon in the preson
40014011	and his heed was brought in a platter and geven to the damsell and she brought it to her mother .
40014012	And his disciples came and toke vp his body and buryed it : and went and tolde Iesus .
40014013	When Iesus hearde that he departed thence by shippe in to a desert place out of ye waye . And when the people had hearde therof they folowed him afote out of their cities .
40014014	And Iesus went forth and sawe moche people and his herte did melte vpon them and he healed of them those that were sicke .
40014015	When even was come his disciples came to him sayinge . This is a deserte place and the daye is spent : let the people departe yt they maye go into ye tounes and bye them vytayllis .
40014016	But Iesus sayde vnto them . They have no neade to go awaye . Geve ye the to eate .
40014017	Then sayde they vnto him : we have here but . v . loves and two fysshes .
40014018	And he sayde : bringe the hyther to me .
40014019	And he comaunded ye people to syt downe on ye grasse : and toke ye . v . loves and the . ii . fysshes and loked vp to heven and blessed and brake and gave the loves to his disciples and the disciples gave them to ye people .
40014020	And they dyd all eate and were suffised . And they gadered vp of ye gobbetes that remayned vii . basketes full .
40014021	And they yt ate werein nobre about . v . M . men besyde wemen and chyldren .
40014022	And strayght waye Iesus made his disciples enter into a shippe and to goo over before him whill he sent ye people awaye .
40014023	And assone as he had sent the people awaye he went vp into a moutayne alone to praye . And when nyght was come he was there himsilf alone .
40014024	And the shippe was now in the middes of the see and was toost with waves for it was a cotrary wynde .
40014025	In the fourthe watche of ye night Iesus came vnto them walkynge on the see .
40014026	And when his disciples sawe him walkynge on the see they were troubled sayinge : it is some spirite and cryed out for feare .
40014027	And streyght waye Iesus spake vnto them sayinge : be of god cheare it is I be not afrayed .
40014028	Peter answered him and sayde : master if thou be he bid me come vnto the on the water .
40014029	And he sayde come . And when Peter was come doune out of ye shippe he walked on ye water to go to Iesus .
40014030	But when he sawe a myghty wynde he was afrayed . And as he beganne to synke he cryed sayinge : master save me .
40014031	And immediatly Iesus stretched forth his hode and caught him and sayde to him : O thou of lytell faith wherfore diddest thou dout ?
40014032	And assone as they were come in to ye shippe ye wynde ceassed .
40014033	Then they that were in the shippe came and worshipped him sayinge : of a truth thou arte ye sonne of God .
40014034	And when they were come over they went in to ye londe of Genazareth .
40014035	And when ye men of yt place had knowledge of him they sent out in to all yt countre rounde about and brought vnto him all that were sicke
40014036	and besought him that they myght touche the hemme of his vesture only . And as many as touched it were made safe .
40015001	Then came to Iesus scribes and pharises from Ierusalem sayinge :
40015002	why do thy disciples transgresse the tradicios of ye elders ? for they wesshe not their hondes when they eate breed .
40015003	He answered and sayde vnto them : why do ye also transgresse ye comaundment of God thorowe youre tradicions ?
40015004	For God comaunded sayinge : honoure thy father and mother and he that cursseth father or mother shall suffer deeth .
40015005	But ye saye every ma shall saye to his father or mother : That which thou desyrest of me to helpe ye with : is geven God :
40015006	and so shall he not honoure his father or his mother . And thus haue ye made yt the comaundment of God is with out effecte through youre tradicios .
40015007	Ypocrites well prophesyed of you Esay sayinge :
40015008	This people draweth nye vnto me with their mouthes and honoureth me with their lippes howbe it their hertes are farre from me :
40015009	but in vayne they worshippe me teachinge doctrines whiche are nothing but mens precepts .
40015010	And he called the people vnto him and sayde to them : heare and vnderstande .
40015011	That which goeth into the mouth defyleth not ye man : but that which commeth out of the mouth defyleth the man .
40015012	Then came his disciples and sayde vnto him . Perceavest thou not how that the pharises are offended in hearinge thys sayinge ?
40015013	He answered and sayde : all plantes which my hevely father hath not planted shalbe plucked vp by the rotes .
40015014	Let them alone they be the blynde leaders of the blynde . If the blynde leede the blynde boothe shall fall into the dyche .
40015015	Then answered Peter and sayd to him : declare vnto vs this parable .
40015016	Then sayde Iesus : are ye yet with oute vnderstondinge ?
40015017	perceave ye not that what soever goeth in at the mouth descendeth doune in to the bely and is cast out into the draught ?
40015018	But those thingis which procede out of the mouth come from the herte and they defyle the man .
40015019	For out of the herte come evyll thoughtis murder breakyng of wedlocke whordo theefte falce witnes berynge blasphemye .
40015020	These are the thingis which defyle a man . But to eate with vnwesshen hondes defyleth not a man .
40015021	And Iesus went thence and departed in to the costis of Tyre and Sidon .
40015022	And beholde a woman which was a Cananite came out of ye same coostis and cryed vnto him sayinge : have mercy on me Lorde the sonne of David my doughter is pytiously vexed with a devyll .
40015023	And he gave her never a worde to answer . Then came to him his disciples and besought him sayinge : sende her awaye for she foloweth vs cryinge .
40015024	He answered and sayde : I am not sent but vnto ye loost shepe of ye housse of Israel .
40015025	Then she came and worshipped him sayinge : master helpe me .
40015026	He answered and sayde : it is not good to take the chyldrens breed and to cast it to whelpes .
40015027	She answered and sayde : truthe Lorde : neverthelesse the whelpes eate of the cromes which fall from their masters table .
40015028	Then Iesus answered and sayde vnto her . O woman greate is thy faith be it to the even as thou desyrest . And her doughter was made whole even at that same houre .
40015029	Then Iesus went awaye from thence and came nye vnto the see of Galile and went vp in to a mountayne and sat doune there .
40015030	And moche people came vnto him havinge with the halt blynde domme maymed and other many : and cast them doune at Iesus fete . And he healed them
40015031	in so moche that the people wondred to se the dome speake the maymed whole the halt to go and ye blynde to se . And they glorified the God of Israel .
40015032	Then Iesus called his disciples to him and sayde : I have compassion on ye people becau se they have cotynued with me now . iii . dayes and have nought to eate : and I wyll not let them departe fastinge leste they perisshe in ye waye .
40015033	And his disciples sayd vnto him : whece shuld we get so moche breed in ye wildernes as shuld suffise so greate a multitude ?
40015034	And Iesus sayde vnto them : how many loves have ye ? And they sayde : seven and a feawe litle fysshes .
40015035	And he comaunded ye people to syt doune on ye grounde :
40015036	and toke the seven loves and the fysshes and gave thankes and brake them and gave to his disciples and the disciples gave them to the people .
40015037	And they dyd all eate and were suffised . And they toke vp of the broke meate that was lefte . vii . basketes full .
40015038	And yet they that ate were . iiii . M . men besyde wemen and chyldren .
40015039	And he sent awaye the people and toke shippe and came into the parties of Magdala .
40016001	Then came the pharises and saduces and did tempte him desyringe him to shewe them some signe from heve .
40016002	He answered and sayde vnto the . At even ye saye we shall have fayre wedder and yt because ye skye is reed :
40016003	and in the morninge ye saye to daye shalbe foule wedder and that because the skye is cloudy and reed . O ye ypocrites ye can discerne ye fassion of the skye : and can ye not discerne ye signes of the tymes ?
40016004	The frowarde nacion and advoutrous seketh a signe and there shall non other signe be geven vnto them but the signe of the prophet Ionas . So lefte he them and departed .
40016005	And when his disciples were come to the other side of the water they had forgotte to take breed with the .
40016006	Then Iesus sayd vnto them : Take hede and beware of the leve of ye Pharises and of ye Saduces .
40016007	And they thought in them selves sayinge : because we have brought no breed with vs .
40016008	When Iesus vnderstode that he sayd vnto the . O ye of lytell faith why are youre mindes cumbred because ye have brought no breed ?
40016009	Do ye not yet perceave nether remeber those . v . loves when there were . v . M . men and how many baskettes toke ye vp ?
40016010	Nether the . vii . loves when there were . iiiii . M . and how many baskettes toke ye vp ?
40016011	Why perceave ye not then yt I spake not vnto you of breed whe I sayde beware of the leven of the Pharises and of the Saduces ?
40016012	The vnderstode they how that he bad not them beware of the leven of breed : but of the doctrine of the Pharises and of the Saduces .
40016013	When Iesus cam in to the costes of the cite which is called Cesarea Philippi he axed his disciples sayinge : whom do men saye yt I the sonne of ma am ?
40016014	They saide some saye yt thou arte Ihon Baptist some Helias some Ieremias or one of ye prophetes .
40016015	He sayde vnto the : but who saye ye yt I am ?
40016016	Simo Peter answered and sayde : Thou arte Christ ye sonne of the lyvinge God .
40016017	And Iesus answered and sayde to him : happy arte thou Simon the sonne of Ionas for fleshe and bloud hath not opened vnto the yt but my father which is in heve .
40016018	And I saye also vnto the yt thou arte Peter : and apon this rocke I wyll bylde my congregacion . And the gates of hell shall not prevayle ageynst it .
40016019	And I wyll geve vnto the the keyes of the kyngdom of heven : and whatsoever thou byndest vpon erth shall be bounde in heven : and whatsoever thou lowsest on erthe shalbe lowsed in heven .
40016020	Then he charged his disciples yt they shulde tell no man yt he was Iesus Christ .
40016021	From yt tyme forth Iesus began to shewe vnto his disciples how yt he must go vnto Ierusalem and suffer many thinges of ye Elders and of ye hye prestes and of the scribes and must be killed and ryse agayne ye thirde daye .
40016022	But Peter toke him asyde and began to rebuke him sayinge : master faver thy sylfe this shall not come vnto the .
40016023	Then tourned he aboute and sayde vnto Peter : come after me Satan thou offendest me because thou sauourest not godly thinges but wordly thinges
40016024	Iesus then sayde to his disciples . If eny man wyll folowe me leet him forsake him sylfe and take vp his crosse and folowe me .
40016025	For who soever wyll save his lyfe shall loose it . And whosoever shall loose his lyfe for my sake shall fynde it .
40016026	What shall it proffet a man though he shulde wynne all the whoole worlde : yf he loose his owne soule ? Or els what shall a man geve to redeme his soule agayne with all ?
40016027	For the sonne of man shall come in the glory of his father wt his angels : and then shall he rewarde every man accordinge to his dedes .
40016028	Verely I saye vnto you some ther be amonge them that here stonde which shall not taste of deeth tyll they shall have sene the sonne of man come in his kyngdomen .
40017001	And after . vi . dayes Iesus toke Peter and Iames and Ihon his brother and brought them vp into an hye mountayne out of the waye
40017002	and was transfygured before them : and his face did shyne as the sunne and his clothes were as whyte as the light .
40017003	And beholde ther appered vnto the Moses and Helyas talkinge with him .
40017004	Then answered Peter and sayde to Iesus : master here is good beinge for vs . If thou wylt leet vs make here . iii . tabernacles one for the and one for Moses and one for Helyas .
40017005	Whyll he yet spake beholde a bright cloude shadowed them . And beholde there came a voyce out of ye cloude sayinge : this is my deare sonne in whom I delite heare him .
40017006	And when the disciples hearde that they fell on their faces and were soore afrayed .
40017007	And Iesus came and touched them and sayde : aryse and be not afrayed .
40017008	And when they looked vp they saw no man saue Iesus onely .
40017009	And as they came doune from the mountayne Iesus charged them sayinge : se yt ye shewe the vision to no man vntyll the sonne of man be rysen ageyne from deeth .
40017010	And his disciples axed of him sayinge : Why then saye the scribes yt Helyas muste fyrst come ?
40017011	Iesus answered and sayd vnto them : Helyas shall fyrst come and restore all thinges .
40017012	And I saye vnto you yt Helyas is come alredy and they knewe him not : but have done vnto him whatsoever they lusted . In lyke wyse shall also the sonne of man suffre of the .
40017013	Then ye disciples perceaved that he spake vnto them of Ihon baptist .
40017014	And when they were come to ye people ther cam to him a certayne man and kneled doune to him and sayde :
40017015	Master have mercy on my sonne for he is franticke : and is sore vexed . And oft tymes he falleth into the fyre and oft into ye water
40017016	And I brought him to thy disciples and they coulde not heale him .
40017017	Iesus answered and sayde : O generacion faythles and croked : how longe shall I be with you ? how longe shall I suffre you ? bring him hidder to me .
40017018	And Iesus rebuked the devyll and he ca out of him . And ye child was healed even yt same houre .
40017019	Then came the disciples to Iesus secretly and sayde : Why could not we cast him out ?
40017020	Iesus sayd vnto the : Because of youre vnbelefe For I saye veryly vnto you : yf ye had faythe as a grayne of musterd seed ye shuld saye vnto this moutayne remove hence to yonder place and he shuld remove : nether shuld eny thinge be vnpossible for you to do .
40017021	How be it this kynde goeth not oute but by prayer and fastinge .
40017022	As they passed the tyme in Galile Iesus sayde vnto them : the sonne of man shalbe betrayed into the hondes of men
40017023	and they shall kill him and the thyrd daye he shall ryse agayne . And they sorowed greatly .
40017024	And when they were come to Capernau they yt were wont to gadre poll money came to Peter and sayde : Doth youre master paye tribute ?
40017025	He sayd : ye . And when he was come into the house Iesus spake fyrst to him saying What thinkest thou Simon ? of whome do ye kynges of the erth take tribute or poll money ? of their chyldren or of straungers ?
40017026	Peter sayde vnto him : of straungers . Then sayd Iesus vnto him agayne : Then are the chyldren fre .
40017027	Neverthelesse lest we shuld offende the : goo to ye see and cast in thyne angle and take the fysshe yt fyrst cometh vp : and when thou hast opened his mouthe thou shalt fynde a pece of twentie pence : yt take and paye for me and the .
40018001	The same tyme the disciples came vnto Iesus saying : who is ye greatest in the kyngdome of heve ?
40018002	Iesus called a chylde vnto him and set him in the middes of them :
40018003	and sayd . Verely I say vnto you : except ye tourne and become as chyldren ye cannot enter into the kyngdom of heven .
40018004	Whosoever therfore humble him sylfe as this chylde the same is the greatest in ye kyngdome of heve .
40018005	And who soever receaveth suche a chylde in my name receaveth me .
40018006	But whosoever offende one of these lytelons which beleve in me : it were better for him that a milstone were hanged aboute his necke and that he were drouned in the depth of the see .
40018007	Wo be vnto the world because of offences . How be it it cannot be avoided but yt offences shalbe geven . Neverthelesse woo be to ye man by who the offence cometh .
40018008	Wherfore yf thy honde or thy fote offende the cut him of and cast him from the . It ys better for the to enter into lyfe halt or maymed rather then thou shuldest havinge two hondes or two fete be cast into everlasting fyre .
40018009	And yf also thyne eye offende the plucke him oute and caste him from the . It is better for the to enter into lyfe with one eye then havyng two eyes to be cast into hell fyre .
40018010	Se that ye despise not one of these litelons . For I saye vnto you yt in heven their angels alwayes behold the face of my father which is in heven .
40018011	Ye and the sonne of man is come to saue that which is lost .
40018012	How thinke ye ? Yf a man have an hondred shepe and one of them be gone astray dothe he not leve nynty and nyne in ye moutains and go and seke that one which is gone astray ?
40018013	If it happen that he fynd him veryly I say vnto you : he reioyseth more of that shepe then of the nynty and nyne which went not astray .
40018014	Even so it is not the wyll of youre father in heven that one of these lytelons shulde perishe .
40018015	Moreover yf thy brother treaspace agenst the . Go and tell him his faute betwene him and the alone . Yf he heare the thou hast wone thy brother :
40018016	But yf he heare the not then take yet with the one or two that in the mouth of two or thre witnesses all thinges maye be stablisshed .
40018017	If he heare not them tell it vnto the congregacion . If he heare not ye congregacion take him as an hethen man and as a publican .
40018018	Verely I say vnto you what soever ye bynde on erth shalbe bounde in heven . And what soever ye lowse on erth shalbe lowsed in heven .
40018019	Agayn I say vnto you that yf two of you shall agre in erth apon eny maner thynge what soever they shall desyre : it shalbe geven them of my father which is in heven .
40018020	For where two or thre are gathered togedder in my name there am I in the myddes of them .
40018021	Then came Peter to him and sayde : master howe ofte shall I forgeve my brother yf he synne agaynst me seven tymes ?
40018022	Iesus sayd vnto him : I saye not vnto the seven tymes : but seventy tymes seven tymes .
40018023	Therfore is ye kingdome of heven lykened vnto a certayne kynge which wolde take a countis of his servauntis .
40018024	And when he had begone to recken one was broughte vnto him whiche ought him ten thousande talentis :
40018025	whome be cause he had nought to paye his master commaunded him to be solde and his wyfe and his chyldren and all that he had and payment to be made .
40018026	The servaunt fell doune and besought him sayinge : Sir geve me respyte and I wyll paye it every whit .
40018027	Then had the Lorde pytie on that servaunt and lowsed him and forgave him the det .
40018028	And ye sayde servaut wet oute and founde one of his felowes which ought him an hundred pence and leyed hondes on him and toke him by the throote sayinge : paye me yt thou owest .
40018029	And his felowe fell doune and besought him sayinge : have pacience with me and I wyll paye the all .
40018030	And he wolde not but went and cast him into preson tyll he shulde paye the det .
40018031	When his other felowes sawe what was done they were very sory and came and tolde vnto their lorde all yt had happened .
40018032	Then his lorde called him and sayde vnto him . O evyll servaut I forgave the all that det because thou prayedst me : was it not mete also yt thou
40018033	shuldest have had copassion on thy felow even as I had pitie on ye ?
40018034	And his lorde was wrooth and delyuered him to the iaylers tyll he shnld paye all that was due to him .
40018035	So lyke wyse shall my hevenly father do vnto you except ye forgeve with youre hertes eache one to his brother their treaspases .
40019001	And it came to passe when Iesus had fynisshed those sayinges he gat him from Galile and came into the coostes of Iewry beyonde Iordan
40019002	and moche people folowed him and he healed them theare .
40019003	Then came vnto him the pharises temtinge him and sayinge to him : Ys it lawfull for a man to put awaye his wyfe for all maner of causes ?
40019004	He answered and sayd vnto them : Have ye not redde how that he which made man at the beginninge made them man and woman
40019005	and sayde : for this thinge shall a ma leve father and mother and cleve vnto his wyfe and they twayne shalbe one flesshe .
40019006	Wherfore now are they not twayne but one flesshe . Let not man therfore put a sunder that which God hath cuppled to gedder .
40019007	The sayde they to him : why did Moses comaunde to geve a testimoniall of divorsemet and to put hyr awaye ?
40019008	He sayde vnto them : Moses because of the hardnes of youre hertes suffred you to put awaye youre wyfes : But from ye beginnynge it was not so .
40019009	I saye therfore vnto you whosoever putteth awaye his wyfe ( except it be for fornicacion ) and maryeth another breaketh wedlocke . And whosoever maryeth her which is divorsed doeth commyt advoutry .
40019010	Then sayde his disciples to him : yf the mater be so betwene man and wyfe then is it not good to mary .
40019011	He sayde vnto them : all me can not awaye with that sayinge save they to whom it is geve .
40019012	Ther are chaste which were so borne out of their mothers belly . And ther are chaste which be made of men . And ther be chaste which have made them selves chaste for the kyngdome of heves sake . He that can take it let him take it .
40019013	Then were brought to him yonge chyldre that he shuld put his hondes on them and praye And the disciples rebuked them .
40019014	But Iesus sayde : suffre the chyldren and forbid them not to come to me : for of suche is the kyngdome of heven .
40019015	And when he had put his hondes on them he departed thence .
40019016	And beholde one came and sayde vnto him : good master what good thinge shall I do that I maye have eternall lyfe ?
40019017	He sayde vnto him : why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one and that is God . But yf thou wylt entre in to lyfe kepe the commaundementes .
40019018	The other sayde to him Which ? And Iesus sayde : breake no wedloke kill not steale not : beare not falce witnes :
40019019	honoure father and mother : and love thyne neighbour as thy sylfe .
40019020	And the younge man sayde vnto him : I have observed all these thingis from my youth what lacke I yet ?
40019021	And Iesus sayde vnto him yf thou wylt be perfecte goo and sell that thou hast and geve it to the povre and thou shalt have treasure in heven and come and folowe me .
40019022	When ye younge ma hearde yt sayinge he wet awaye mourninge . For he had greate possessions .
40019023	Then Iesus sayde vnto his disciples : Verely I saye vnto you : yt is harde for a ryche ma to enter into ye kyngdome of heaven .
40019024	And moreover I saye vnto you : it is easier for a camell to go through the eye of a nedle then for a ryche man to enter into the kyngdome of God .
40019025	When his disciples hearde that they were excedingly amased sayinge : who then can be saved ?
40019026	Iesus behelde the and sayde vnto them : with men this is vnpossible but with God all thinges are possible .
40019027	Then answered Peter and sayde to him : Beholde we have forsaken all and folowed the what shall we have ?
40019028	Iesus sayde vnto them : verely I saye to you : when the sonne of man shall syt in ye seate of his maieste ye which folowe me in ye seconde generacion shall syt also vpon . xii . seates and iudge ye . xii . tribes of Israel .
40019029	And whosoever forsaketh housses or brethren or systers other father or mother or wyfe or chyldren or landes for my names sake ye same shall receave an hundred folde and shall inheret everlastynge lyfe .
40019030	Many that are fyrste shalbe laste and the laste shalbe fyrste .
40020001	For the kyngdome of heven ys lyke vnto an houssholder which went out erly in the morninge to hyre labourers into hys vyneyarde .
40020002	And he agreed wt the labourers for a peny a daye and sent them into his vyneyarde .
40020003	And he went out about the thyrde houre and sawe other stonding ydell in the marketplace
40020004	and sayd vnto them go ye also into my vyneyarde : and whatsoever is right I will geve you . And they went there waye .
40020005	Agayne he wet out about the sixte and nynthe houre and dyd lyke wyse .
40020006	And he went out aboute the eleventhe houre and founde other stondynge ydell and sayde vnto them : Why stonde ye here all the daye ydell ?
40020007	They sayde vnto hym : because no man hath hyred vs . He sayde to them : goo ye alsoo into my vyneyarde and whatsoever is right that shall ye receave .
40020008	When even was come the lorde of the vyneyarde sayde vnto hys steward : call the labourers and geve them their hyre beginnyng at ye laste tyll thou come to ye fyrste .
40020009	And they whiche were hyred aboute the eleventhe houre came and receaved every man a peny .
40020010	Then came ye fyrst supposyng yt they shuld receave moare : and they likewyse receaved every man a peny .
40020011	And when they had receaved it they murmured agaynst the good man of the housse
40020012	saying : These laste have wrought but one houre and thou hast made them equall vnto vs which have born ye burthe and heet of the daye .
40020013	He answered to one of the sayinge : frende I do the no wronge : dyddest thou not agre wt me for a peny ?
40020014	Take that which is thy duty and go thy waye . I will geve vnto this last as moche as to the .
40020015	Ys it not lawfull for me to do as me listeth with myne awne ? Ys thyne eye evyll because I am good ?
40020016	Soo the laste shalbe fyrste and the fyrste shalbe laste . For many are called and feawe be chosen .
40020017	And Iesus ascended to Ierusalem and toke the . xii . disciples a parte in the waye and sayde to the .
40020018	Beholde we goo vp to Ierusalem and the sonne of ma shalbe betrayed vnto ye chefe prestes and vnto the scribes and they shall condene him to deeth
40020019	and shall delyvre him to the getils to be mocked to be scourged and to be crucified : and ye thyrd daye he shall ryse agayne .
40020020	Then came to hym the mother of zebedes chyldren with her sonnes worshippynge him and desyringe a certayne thinge of him .
40020021	And he sayd vnto her : what wilt thou have ? She sayde vnto him : Gravnte that these my two sonnes may sit ye one on thy right hond and the other on ye lifte hond in thy kyngdome .
40020022	Iesus answered and sayd : Ye wot not what ye axe . Are ye able to drynke of the cuppe yt I shall drynke of and to be baptised wt the baptyme that I shalbe baptised with ? They answered to him that we are .
40020023	And he sayd vnto the : Ye shall drinke of my cvp and shalbe baptised with the baptyme that I shalbe baptised with . But to syt on my ryght hond and on my lyst hond is not myne to geve : but to them for whom it is prepared of my father .
40020024	And when the ten hearde this they disdayned at ye two brethre :
40020025	But Iesus called them vnto him and sayde : Ye knowe yt the lordes of the gentyls have dominacio over them . And they that are great exercise power over the .
40020026	It shall not be so amoge you . But whosoever wyll be greate amoge you let him be youre minister :
40020027	and whosoever wil be chefe let him be youre servaut
40020028	eve as the sonne of man came not to be ministred vnto but to minister and to geve his lyfe for the redempcion of many .
40020029	And as they departed fro Hierico moche people folowed him .
40020030	And beholde two blinde men sittinge by ye waysyde whe they hearde Iesus passe by cryed sayinge : Thou Lorde ye sonne of David have mercy on vs .
40020031	And ye people rebuked them be cause they shulde holde their peace . But they cryed ye moare sayinge : have mercy on vs thou Lorde which arte ye sonne of David .
40020032	Then Iesus stode styll and called the and sayde : what will ye that I shulde do to you :
40020033	They sayd to him : Lorde that oure eyes maye be opened .
40020034	Iesus had copassion on the and touched their eyes . And immediatly their eyes receaved syght . And they folowed him .
40021001	When they drewe neye vnto Ierusalem and were come to Betphage vnto mounte olivete : then sent Iesus two of his disciples
40021002	saiynge to the . Go in to the toune that lyeth over agaynste you and anone ye shall fynde an asse bounde and her colte with her : lose them and bringe them vnto me .
40021003	And if eny man saye ought vnto you saye ye yt the lorde hath neade of them : and streyght waye he will let them go .
40021004	All this was done to fulfyll that which was spoken by the Prophet sayinge :
40021005	Tell ye the doughter of Sion : beholde thy kynge cometh vnto the meke and sittinge vpon an asse and a colte the fole of an asse vsed to the yooke .
40021006	The disciples went and dyd as Iesus comaunded them
40021007	and brought ye asse and the colte and put on them their clothes and set him theron .
40021008	And many of the people spreed their garmentes in ye waye . Other cut doune braunches fro the trees and strawed them in the waye .
40021009	Moreover the people that went before and they also that came after cryed sayinge : Hosanna to ye sonne of David . Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lorde Hosanna in the hyest .
40021010	And when he was come in to Ierusalem all the cyte was moved sayinge : who is this ?
40021011	And the people sayde : this is Iesus the Prophet of Nazareth a cyte of Galile .
40021012	And Iesus went in to the temple of God and cast out all them that soulde and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the mony chaugers and the seates of them that solde doves
40021013	and sayde to them : It is wrytten my housse shalbe called the housse of prayer . But ye have made it a denne of theves .
40021014	And the blinde and the halt came to him in ye teple and he healed the .
40021015	When the chefe prestes and scribes sawe the marveylles that he dyd and the chyldren cryinge in the teple and sayinge Hosanna to the sonne of David they disdayned
40021016	and sayde vnto him : hearest thou what these saye ? Iesus sayde vnto them yee : have ye never redde of the mouth of babes and suckelinges thou haste ordeyned prayse ?
40021017	And he lefte the and wet out of ye cite vnto Bethanie and had his abydige there .
40021018	In the mornynge as he returned in to the cyte ageyne he hungred
40021019	and spyed a fygge trre in the waye and came to it and founde nothinge theron but leves only and sayd to it never frute growe on the hence forwardes . And ano the fygge tree wyddered awaye .
40021020	And when his disciples sawe that they marveled sayinge : Howe sone is the fygge tree wyddered awaye ?
40021021	Iesus answered and sayde vnto the : Verely I saye vnto you yf ye shall have faith and shall not dout ye shall not only do that which I have done to the fygge tree : but also yf ye shall saye vnto this moutayne take thy silfe awaye and cast thy silfe into the see it shalbe done .
40021022	And whatsoever ye shall axe in prayer ( if ye beleve ) ye shall receave it .
40021023	And when he was come into the teple the chefe prestes and the elders of the people came vnto him as he was teachinge and sayde : by what auctorite doest thou these thinges ? and who gave the this power ?
40021024	Iesus answered and sayde vnto them : I also will axe of you a certayne question which if ye assoyle me I in lyke wyse wyll tell you by what auctorite I do these thinges .
40021025	The baptime of Iohn : whence was it ? fro heve or of men ? Then they reasoned amoge them selves sayinge : yf we shall saye fro heven he will saye vnto vs : why dyd ye not then beleve hym ?
40021026	But and if we shall saye of men then feare we the people . For all men helde Iohn as a Prophet .
40021027	And they answered Iesus and sayde : we cannot tell . And he lyke wyse sayd vnto them : nether tell I you by what auctorite I do these thinges .
40021028	What saye ye to this ? A certayne man had two sonnes and came to ye elder and sayde : sonne go and worke to daye in my vineyarde .
40021029	He answered and sayde I will not : but afterwarde repented and went .
40021030	Then came he to the second and sayde lyke wyse . And he answered and sayde : I will syr : yet wet not .
40021031	Whether of the twayne dyd the will of the father ? And they sayde vnto hym : the fyrst . Iesus sayde vnto the : verely I saye vnto you that the publicans and the harlotes shall come into ye kyngdome of God before you .
40021032	For Iohn came vnto you in the waye of rightewesnes and ye beleved hym not . But the publicans and the harlotes beleved him . And yet ye ( though ye sawe it ) were not yet moved with repentaunce that ye myght afterwarde have beleved hym .
40021033	Herken another similitude . Ther was a certayne housholder which planted a vineyarde and hedged it roude about and made a wynpresse in it and bilt a tower and let it out to husbandmen and wet in to a straunge coutre .
40021034	And when the tyme of the frute drewe neare he sent his servauntes to the husbandmen to receave the frutes of it .
40021035	And ye husbandme caught his servauntes and bet one kylled another and stoned another .
40021036	Agayne he sent other servantes moo then the fyrst : and they served them lyke wyse .
40021037	But last of all he sent vnto the his awne sonne sayinge : they will feare my sonne .
40021038	But when the husbandmen sawe the sonne they sayde amoge the selves : This is the heyre : come let vs kyll him and let vs take his inheritaunce to oure selves .
40021039	And they caught him and thrust him out of the vineyarde and slewe him .
40021040	When the lorde of the vyneyarde commeth what will he do wt those husbandme ?
40021041	They sayde vnto him : he will cruellye destroye those evyll persons and wyll let out his vyneyarde vnto other husbandmen which shall delyver him the frute at tymes convenient
40021042	Iesus sayde vnto the : dyd ye never redde in the scriptures ? The stone which ye bylders refused ye same is set in ye principall parte of ye corner : this was the lordes doinge and yt is mervelous in oure eyes .
40021043	Therfore saye I vnto you the kyngdome of God shalbe take from you and shalbe geve to the getyls which shall brynge forth the frutes of it .
40021044	And whosoever shall fall on this stone he shalbe broken but on whosoever it shall fall vpon it will grynde him to powder .
40021045	And when the chefe prestes and Pharises hearde these similitudes they perceaved yt he spake of the .
40021046	And they wet about to laye hondes on him but they feared ye people because they tooke him as a Prophet .
40022001	And Iesus answered and spake vnto them agayne in similitudes sayinge .
40022002	The kingdome of heve is lyke vnto a certayne kynge which maryed his sonne
40022003	and sent forth his servantes to call them that were byd to the weddinge and they wolde not come .
40022004	Ageyne he sent forth other servauntes sayinge : Tell them which are bydden : beholde I have prepared my dynner myne oxen and my fatlinges are kylled and all thinges are redy come vnto the mariage .
40022005	But they made light of it and went their wayes : one to his ferme place another about his marchaundise
40022006	the remnaunt toke his seruantes and intreated them vngodly and slewe them .
40022007	When the kinge hearde that he was wroth and send forth his warryers and distroyed those murtherers and brent vp their cyte .
40022008	Then sayde he to his servauutes : the weddinge was prepared . But they which were bydden were not worthy .
40022009	Go ye therfore out into ye hyewayes and as many as ye finde byd them to the mariage .
40022010	The seruauntes wet out into the hiewayes and gaddered to gedder as many as they coulde fynde both good and bad and ye weddinge was furnysshed with gestes .
40022011	Then the kynge came in to viset the gestes and spyed there a ma which had not on a weddinge garment
40022012	and sayde vnto him : frende how fortuned it that thou camest in hither and hast not on a weddyng garment ? And he was eve spechlesse .
40022013	Then sayde the kynge to his ministers : take and bynde hym hand and fote and caste hym into vtter darcknes there shalbe wepinge and gnasshinge of teth .
40022014	For many are called and feawe be chosen .
40022015	Then wet the Pharises and toke counsell how they might tagle him in his wordes .
40022016	And they sent vnto him their disciples with Herodes servauntes sayinge : Master we knowe yt thou are true and teachest the waye of god trulie nether carest for eny man for thou consydrest not menes estate .
40022017	Tell vs therfore : how thynkest thou ? Is it lawfull to geve tribute vnto Cesar or not ?
40022018	Iesus perceaved their wikednes and sayde : Why tempte ye me ye ypocrites ?
40022019	Let me se ye tribute money . And they toke hym a peny .
40022020	And he sayde vnto them : whose is this ymage and superscripcion ?
40022021	They sayde vnto him : Cesars . Then sayde he vnto them . Geve therfore to Cesar that which is Cesars : and geve vnto god that which is goddes .
40022022	When they hearde that they marveled and lefte hym and went there waye .
40022023	The same daye the Saduces came to him ( which saye that there is no resurrcecion ) and axed him
40022024	sayinge : Master Moses bade yf a man dye havinge no chyldre that the brother mary his wyfe and reyse vp seed vnto his brother .
40022025	Ther were wt vs seven brethre and the fyrste maried and deceased wt oute yssue and lefte his wyfe vnto his brother .
40022026	Lykewise the seconde and ye thryd vnto the sevethe .
40022027	Laste of all the woman dyed also .
40022028	Now in the resurreccion whose wyfe shall she be of the seven ? For all had her .
40022029	Iesus answered and sayde vnto the : ye are deceaved and vnderstonde not the scriptures nor yet the power of God .
40022030	For in the resurreccion they nether mary nor are maryed : but are as the angels of God in heven .
40022031	As touchynge the resurreccion of the deed : have ye not redde what is sayde vnto you of God which sayeth :
40022032	I am Abrahams God and Ysaacks God and the God of Iacob ? God is not the God of the deed : but of the lyvinge .
40022033	And when the people hearde that they were astonyed at his doctrine .
40022034	When the Pharises had hearde how yt he had put the Saduces to silence they drewe to gedder
40022035	and one of them which was a doctoure of lawe axed a question teptinge h m and sayinge :
40022036	Master which is ye chefe comaundment in the lawe ?
40022037	Iesus sayde vnto him : love the Lorde thy God wt all thine herte with all thy soule and with all thy mynde .
40022038	This is the fyrst and the chefe comaundement .
40022039	And ther is another lyke vnto this . Love thyne neghbour as thy selfe .
40022040	In these two commaundemetes hange all the lawe and the Prophetes .
40022041	Whyll the Pharises were gaddered togeder Iesus axed
40022042	the sayinge : what thinke ye of Christ ? Whose sonne is he ? They sayde vnto him : the sonne of David .
40022043	He sayde vnto the : how then doeth David in spirite call him Lorde sayinge ?
40022044	The Lorde sayde to my Lorde syt on my right honde : tyll I make thyne enemyes thy fote stole .
40022045	Yf David call him Lorde : how is he then his sonne ?
40022046	And none coulde answere him ageyne one worde : nether dueste eny from that daye forth axe him eny moo questions .
40023001	Then spake Iesus to the people and to his disciples
40023002	sayinge . The Scribes and the Pharises sit in Moses seate .
40023003	All therfore whatsoever they byd you observe that observe and do : but after their workes do not :
40023004	For they saye and do not . Ye and they bynde hevy burthes and grevous to be borne and ley the on menes shulders : but they themsylfes will not heave at them with one of their fyngers .
40023005	All their workes they do for to be sene of me . They set abroade their philateries and make large borders on there garmetes
40023006	and love to sit vppermooste at feastes and to have the chefe seates in the synagoges
40023007	and gretinges in the marketes and to be called of men Rabi .
40023008	But ye shall not suffre youre selves to be called Rabi . For one is youre master that is to wyt Christ and all ye are brethre .
40023009	And call no man youre father vpon the erth for there is but one youre father and he is in heven .
40023010	Be not called masters for there is but one youre master and he is Christ .
40023011	He that is greatest amoge you shalbe youre seruaunte .
40023012	But whosoever exalteth himsilfe shalbe brought lowe . And he yt hubleth himsilfe shalbe exalted .
40023013	Wo be vnto you Scribes and Pharises ypocrites for ye shutte vp the kyngdome of heve before men : ye youre selves goo not in nether suffre ye them that come to enter in .
40023014	Wo be vnto you Scribes and Pharises ypocrites : ye devoure widdowes houses and that vnder a coloure of praying longe prayers : wherfore ye shall receave greater damnacion .
40023015	Wo be vnto you Scribes and Pharises ypocrites which compasse see and londe to bringe one in to youre belefe : and when he ys brought ye make him two folde more the chylde of hell then ye youre selves are .
40023016	Wo be vnto you blynd gides which saye whosoever sweare by the teple it is no thinge : but whosoever sweare by the golde of the temple he offendeth .
40023017	Ye foles and blinde ? whether is greater the golde or the teple that sanctifieth ye golde .
40023018	And whosoever sweareth by the aulter it is nothinge : but whosoever sweareth by ye offeringe yt lyeth on ye aultre offendeth .
40023019	Ye foles and blinde : whether is greater ye offeringe or ye aultre which sanctifieth ye offeringe ?
40023020	Whosoever therfore sweareth by ye aultre sweareth by it and by all yt there on is .
40023021	And whosoever sweareth by the teple sweareth by it and by hym yt dwelleth therin .
40023022	And he that sweareth by heve swereth by the seate of God and by hym that sytteth theron .
40023023	Wo be to you Scribes and Pharises ypocrites which tythe mynt annyse and comen and leave the waygthtyer mattres of ye lawe vndone : iudgemet mercy and fayth . These ought ye to have done and not to have left the othre vndone .
40023024	Ye blinde gydes which strayne out a gnat and swalowe a cammyll .
40023025	Wo be to you scribes and pharises ypocrites which make clene ye vtter syde of the cuppe and of the platter : but within they are full of brybery and excesse .
40023026	Thou blinde Pharise clense fyrst the outsyde of the cup and platter that the ynneside of them maye be clene also .
40023027	Wo be to you Scribe and Pharises ypocrite for ye are lyke vnto paynted tombes which appere beautyfull outwarde : but are wt in full of deed bones and of all fylthynes .
40023028	So are ye for outwarde ye appere righteous vnto me when within ye are full of ypocrisie and iniquite .
40023029	Wo be vnto you Scribes and Pharises ypocrites : ye bylde the tombes of the Prophetes and garnisshe the sepulchres of the righteous
40023030	and saye : Yf we had bene in the dayes of oure fathers we wolde not have bene parteners with them in the bloud of the Prophetes .
40023031	So then ye be witnesses vnto youre selfes that ye are the chyldren of them which killed the prophetes .
40023032	Fulfill ye lyke wyse the measure of youre fathers .
40023033	Yee serpentes and generacion of vipers how shuld ye scape ye dapnacio of hell ?
40023034	Wherfore beholde I sende vnto you prophetes wyse men and scribes and of the ye shall kyll and crucifie : and of the ye shall scourge in youre synagoges and persecute from cyte to cyte
40023035	that vpon you maye come all the righteous bloude that was sheed vpon the erth fro the bloud of righteous Abell vnto ye bloud of zacharias the sonne of Barachias who ye slewe betwene the teple and ye altre .
40023036	Verely I say vnto you all these thinges shall light vpon this generacion .
40023037	Hierusalem hierusalem which kyllest prophetes and stonest the which are sent to the : how often wolde I have gadered thy chyldren to gether as the henne gadreth her chickes vnder her winges but ye wolde not :
40023038	Beholde youre habitacio shalbe lefte vnto you desolate .
40023039	For I saye to you ye shall not se me heceforthe tyll that ye saye : blessed is he that cometh in the name of ye Lorde .
40024001	And Iesus went out and departed fro the teple : and his disciples came to hym for to shewe him the byldinge of the teple .
40024002	Iesus sayde vnto the : se ye not all these thinges ? Verely I saye vnto you : ther shall not be here lefte one stone vpon another that shall not be cast doune .
40024003	And as he sat vpon the mout Olivete his disciples came vnto hym secretely sayinge . Tell vs when these thinges shalbe ? And what signe shalbe of thy comynge and of the ende of the worlde ?
40024004	And Iesus answered and sayde vnto them : take hede that no ma deceave you .
40024005	For many shall come in my name sayinge : I am Christ and shall deceave many .
40024006	Ye shall heare of warres and of the fame of warres : but se yt ye be not troubled . For all these thinges must come to passe but the ende is not yet .
40024007	For nacio shall ryse ageynste nacio and realme ageynste realme : and ther shalbe pestilence honger and erthquakes in all quarters .
40024008	All these are the beginninge of sorowes .
40024009	Then shall they put you to trouble and shall kyll you : and ye shalbe hated of all nacions for my names sake .
40024010	And then shall many be offended and shall betraye one another and shall hate one the other .
40024011	And many falce Prophetes shall aryse and shall deceave many .
40024012	And because iniquite shall have the vpper hande the love of many shall abate .
40024013	But he that endureth to the ende the same shalbe safe .
40024014	And this gladtidingees of the kyngdome shalbe preached in all the worlde for a witnes vnto all nacions : and then shall the ende come .
40024015	When ye therfore shall se ye abhominacio that betokeneth desolacion spoken of by Daniell the Prophet stonde in ye holy place : let him that redeth it vnderstonde it .
40024016	Then let them which be in Iury flye into the moutaynes .
40024017	And let him which is on ye housse toppe not come downe to fet eny thinge out of his housse .
40024018	Nether let him which is in ye felde returne backe to fetche his clothes .
40024019	Wo be in those dayes to the that are wt chylde and to the yt geve sucke .
40024020	But praye yt youre flight be not in ye winter nether on ye saboth daye .
40024021	For then shalbe greate tribulacio suche as was not fro the beginninge of the worlde to this tyme ner shalbe .
40024022	Ye and except those dayes shuld be shortened there shuld no fleshe be saved : but for ye chosens sake those dayes shalbe shortened .
40024023	Then yf eny ma shall saye vnto you : lo here is Christ or there is Christ : beleve it not .
40024024	For there shall arise false christes and false prophete and shall do great myracles and wondres . In so moche yt if it were possible ye verie electe shuld be deceaved .
40024025	Take hede I have tolde you before .
40024026	Wherfore if they shall saye vnto you : beholde he is in ye desert go not forth : beholde he is in ye secret places beleve not .
40024027	For as ye lightninge cometh out of ye eest and shyneth vnto the weest : so shall the comynge of the sonne of ma be .
40024028	For wheresoever a deed karkas is eve thyther will the egles resorte .
40024029	Immediatly after the tribulacios of those dayes shall the sunne be derkened : and ye mone shall not geve hir light and the starre shall fall from heve and the powers of heve shall move .
40024030	And then shall appere the sygne of the sonne of man in heven . And then shall all the kynreddes of the erth morne and they shall se the sonne of man come in the cloudes of heven with power and greate glorie .
40024031	And he shall sende his angeles with the greate voyce of a trope and they shall gader to gether his chosen from the fower wyndes and from the one ende of the worlde to the other .
40024032	Learne a similitude of the fygge tree : when his braunches are yet tender and his leves sproge ye knowe that sommer is nye .
40024033	So lyke wyse ye when ye see all these thynges be ye sure that it is neare even at the dores .
40024034	Verely I saye vnto you that this generacion shall not passe tyll all these be fulfilled .
40024035	Heven and erth shall perisshe : but my wordes shall abyde .
40024036	But of that daye and houre knowith no man no not ye angels of heve but my father only .
40024037	As the tyme of Noe was so lyke wyse shall the cominge of ye sonne of man be .
40024038	For as in ye dayes before ye floud : they dyd eate and drynke mary and were maried eve vnto ye daye that Noe entred into the shyppe
40024039	and knewe of nothynge tyll the floude came and toke them all awaye . So shall also the commynge of the sonne of man be .
40024040	Then two shalbe in the feldes the one shalbe receaved and the other shalbe refused
40024041	two shalbe gryndinge at ye myll : ye oue shalbe receaved and ye other shalbe refused .
40024042	Wake therfore because ye knowe not what houre youre master wyll come .
40024043	Of this be sure that yf the good man of the housse knewe what houre the thefe wolde come : he wolde suerly watche and not suffre his housse to be broke vppe .
40024044	Therfore be ye also redy for in ye houre ye thinke he wolde not : wyll the sonne of ma come .
40024045	If there be any faithfull servaut and wyse whome his master hath made ruler over his housholde to geve the meate in season covenient :
40024046	happy is that servaunt whom his master ( when he cometh ) shall finde so doinge .
40024047	Verely I saye vnto you he shall make him ruler over all his goodes .
40024048	But and yf that evill servaut shall saye in his herte my master wyll defer his comynge
40024049	and beginne to smyte his felowes ye and to eate and to drinke with the dronke :
40024050	that servauntes master wyll come in adaye when he loketh not for him and in an houre yt he is not ware of
40024051	and wyll devyde him and geve him his rewarde with ypocrites . There shalbe wepinge and gnasshinge of tethe .
40025001	Then ye kyngdome of heven shalbe lykened vnto . x . virgins which toke their lampes and wet to mete the brydgrome :
40025002	fyve of them were folysshe and fyve were wyse .
40025003	The folysshe toke their lampes but toke none oyle wt the .
40025004	But ye wyse tooke oyle wt the in their vesselles wt their lampes also .
40025005	Whill the brydgrome taryed all slombred and slepte .
40025006	And even at mydnyght there was a crye made : beholde the brydgrome cometh goo out against him .
40025007	Then all those virgins arose and prepared their lampes .
40025008	And ye folysshe sayde to ye wyse : geve vs of youre oyle for our lampes goo out ?
40025009	but ye wyse answered sayinge . Not so lest ther be not ynough for vs and you : but goo rather to them yt sell and by for youre selves .
40025010	And whill they went to bye ye brydgrome came : and they yt were redy went in with him to ye weddinge and the gate was shett vp :
40025011	Afterwardes came also ye other virgins sayinge : master master open to vs .
40025012	But he answered and sayde : verely I saye vnto you : I knowe not you .
40025013	Watche therefore : for ye knowe nether the daye nor yet the houre when the sonne of man shall come .
40025014	Lykwyse as a certeyne ma redy to take his iorney to a straunge coutre called his servautes and delivered to them his gooddes .
40025015	And vnto one he gave . v . talentes to another . ii . and to another one : to every man after his abilite and streyght waye departed .
40025016	Then he that had receaved the fyve talentes went and bestowed them and wanne other fyve talentes .
40025017	Lykwyse he that receaved . ii . gayned other . ii .
40025018	But he yt receaved ye one went and digged a pit in the erth and hyd his masters money .
40025019	After a longe season ye lorde of those servauntes came and rekened with the .
40025020	Then came he yt had receaved fyve talentes and brought other fyve talentes sayinge : master thou deliveredst vnto one fyve talentes : beholde I have gayned wt the fyve talentes moo .
40025021	The his master sayde vnto him : well good servaut and faithfull . Thou hast bene faithfull in lytell I will make the ruler over moche : entre in into thy masters ioye .
40025022	Also he that receaved . ii . talentes came and sayde : master thou deliveredest vnto me . ii . talentes : beholde I have wone . ii . other talentes with them .
40025023	And his master sayde vnto him well good servaunt and faithfull . Thou hast bene faithfull in lytell I wyll make the ruler over moche : go in into thy masters ioye .
40025024	Then he which had receaved ye one talent came and sayd : master I considered yt thou wast an harde man which repest where thou sowedst not and gadderest where thou strawedst not
40025025	and was therfore afrayde and went and hyd thy talent in ye erth : Beholde thou hast thyn awne .
40025026	His master answered and sayde vnto him : thou evyll servaut and slewthfull thou knewest yt I repe where I sowed not and gaddre where I strawed not :
40025027	thou oughtest therfore to have had my money to ye chaugers and then at my comynge shulde I have receaved myne awne with vauntage .
40025028	Take therfore the talent from him and geve it vnto him which hath . x . talentes .
40025029	For vnto every man that hath shalbe geven and he shall have aboundance : and from him that hath not shalbe taken awaye even that he hath .
40025030	And cast yt vnprofitable servaunt into vtter dercknes : there shalbe wepynge and gnasshinge of teeth .
40025031	When the sonne of ma cometh in his glorie and all the holy angels wt him then shall he syt vpon the seate of his glorie
40025032	and before him shalbe Gaddred all nacions . And he shall seperate the one from a nother as a shepherde deuideth the shepe from the gootes .
40025033	And he shall set the shepe on his right honde and the gotes on the lyfte .
40025034	Then shall the kynge saye to them on his right honde : Come ye blessed chyldren of my father inheret ye the kyngdo prepared for you from the beginninge of the worlde .
40025035	For I was anhongred and ye gave me meate . I thursted and ye gave me drinke . I was herbourlesse and ye lodged me .
40025036	I was naked and ye clothed me . I was sicke and ye visited me . I was in preson and ye came vnto me .
40025037	Then shall ye righteous answere him sayinge master whe sawe we ye anhongred and feed the ? or a thurst and gave ye drinke ?
40025038	when sawe we ye herbourlesse and lodged the ? or naked and clothed the ?
40025039	or when sawe we the sicke or in preson and came vnto the ?
40025040	And ye kynge shall answere and saye vnto them : verely I saye vnto you : in as moche as ye have done it vnto one of ye leest of these my brethren ye have done it to me .
40025041	Then shall the kynge saye vnto them that shalbe on the lyfte hande : departe from me ye coursed into everlastinge fire which is prepared for the devyll and his angels .
40025042	For I was an hungred and ye gave me no meate . I thursted and ye gave me no drinke .
40025043	I was herbourlesse and ye lodged me not . I was naked and ye clothed me not . I was sicke and in preson and ye visited me not .
40025044	Then shall they also answere him sayinge : master when sawe we the an hungred or a thurst or herbourlesse or naked or sicke or in preson and did not ministre vnto the ?
40025045	Then shall he answere the and saye : Verely I saye vnto you in as moche as ye did it not to one of ye leest of these ye did it not to me .
40025046	And these shall go into everlastinge payne : And the righteous into lyfe eternall .
40026001	And it came to passe when Iesus had fynisshed all these sayinges he sayd vnto his disciples :
40026002	Ye knowe that after ii . dayes shalbe ester and the sonne of man shalbe delyvered to be crucified .
40026003	Then assembled togedder the chefe prestes and the scribes and the elders of the people to the palice of the hye preste called Cayphas
40026004	and heelde a counsell how they mygt take Iesus by suttelte and kyll him .
40026005	But they sayd not on the holy daye lest eny vproure aryse amonge the people .
40026006	When Iesus was in Bethany in the house of Symon the leper
40026007	ther came vnto him a woman which had an alablaster boxe of precious oyntment and powred it on his heed as he sate at the bourde .
40026008	When his disciples sawe that they had indignacion sayinge : what neded this wast ?
40026009	This oyntmet myght have bene well solde and geven to the povre .
40026010	When Iesus vnderstod that he sayde vnto the : why trouble ye the woman ? She hath wrought a good worke apon me .
40026011	For ye shall have povre folcke alwayes with you : but me shall ye not have all wayes .
40026012	And in yt she casted this oyntment on my bodye she dyd it to burye me wt all .
40026013	Verely I saye vnto you wheresoever this gospell shalbe preached throughoute all the worlde there shall also this that she hath done be tolde for a memoriall of her .
40026014	Then one of the twelve called Iudas Iscarioth went vnto the chefe prestes
40026015	and sayd : what will ye geve me and I will deliver him vnto you ? And they apoynted vnto him thirty peces of sylver .
40026016	And from that tyme he sought oportunite to betraye him .
40026017	The fyrst daye of swete breed ye disciples cam to Iesus sayinge vnto him : where wylt thou that we prepare for ye to eate ye paschall lambe ?
40026018	And he sayd : Go into the cite vnto soche a man and saye to him : the master sayeth my tyme is at hande I will kepe myne ester at thy housse with my disciples .
40026019	And the disciples did as Iesus had apoynted them and made redy the esterlambe .
40026020	When the even was come he sate doune wt the . xii .
40026021	And as they dyd eate he sayde : Verely I saye vnto you that one of you shall betraye me .
40026022	And they were excedinge sorowfull and beganne every one of the to saye vnto him : is it I master ?
40026023	He answered and sayde : he yt deppeth his honde wt me in ye disshe the same shall betraye me .
40026024	The sonne of ma goeth as it is written of him : but wo be to yt ma by whom ye sonne of man shalbe betrayed . It had bene good for that man yf he had never bene borne .
40026025	Then Iudas wich betrayed him answered and sayde : is it I master ? He sayde vnto him : thou hast sayde .
40026026	As they dyd eate Iesus toke breed and gave thankes brake it and gave it to the disciples and sayde : Take eate this is my body .
40026027	And he toke the cup and thanked and gave it them sayinge : drinke of it every one .
40026028	For this is my bloude of the new testament that shalbe shedde for many for the remission of synnes .
40026029	I saye vnto you : I will not drinke hence forth of this frute of the vyne tree vntyll that daye when I shall drinke it new with you in my fathers kyngdome .
40026030	And when they had sayde grace they went out into mounte olyvete .
40026031	Then sayd Iesus vnto them : all ye shall be offended by me this night . For it is wrytten . I will smyte ye shepe herde and the shepe of ye flocke shalbe scattered abroode .
40026032	But after I am rysen ageyne I will goo before you into Galile .
40026033	Peter answered and sayde vnto him : though all men shulde be offended by ye yet wolde I never be offended .
40026034	Iesus sayde vnto him . Verely I saye vnto ye that this same night before the cocke crowe thou shalt denye me thryse .
40026035	Peter sayde vnto him : Yf I shulde dye with ye yet wolde I not denye ye Lyke wyse also sayde all ye disciples .
40026036	Then went Iesus with them into a place which is called Gethsemane and sayde vnto the disciples syt ye here whyll I go and praye yonder .
40026037	And he toke with him Peter and the two sonnes of zebede and began to wexe sorowfull and to be in an agonye .
40026038	Then sayd Iesus vnto them : my soule is hevy even vnto the deeth . Tary ye here and watche wt me .
40026039	And he went a lytell aparte and fell flat on his face and prayed sayinge : O my father yf it be possible let this cuppe passe from me : neverthelesse not as I wyll but as thou wylt .
40026040	And he came vnto the disciples and founde them a slepe and sayde to Peter : what coulde ye not watche with me one houre :
40026041	watche and praye that ye fall not into temptacion . The spirite is willynge but the flesshe is weake .
40026042	He went awaye once moare and prayed sayinge : O my father yf this cuppe can not passe away from me but yt I drinke of it thy wyll be fulfylled .
40026043	And he came and founde the a slepe agayne . For their eyes were hevy .
40026044	And he lefte them and went agayne and prayed ye thrid tyme sayinge ye same wordes .
40026045	Then came he to his disciples and sayd vnto them : Slepe hence forth and take youre reest . Take hede the houre is at honde and ye sonne of man shalbe betrayed into ye hondes of synners .
40026046	Ryse let vs be goinge : beholde he is at honde yt shall betraye me .
40026047	Whyll he yet spake : lo Iudas one of ye xii . came and wt him a greate multitude wt sweardes and staves sent from the chefe prestes and elders of the people .
40026048	And he that betrayed him had geven the a token sayinge : whosoever I kysse yt same is he ley hondes on him .
40026049	And forth wt all he came to Iesus and sayde : hayle master and kyssed him .
40026050	And Iesus sayde vnto him : frende wherfore arte thou come ? Then came they and layed hondes on Iesus and toke him .
40026051	And beholde one of them which were with Iesus stretched oute his honde and drue his swearde and stroke a servaunt of the hye preste and smote of his eare .
40026052	Then sayde Iesus vnto him : put vp thy swearde into his sheathe . For all that ley hond on ye swearde shall perisshe with ye swearde .
40026053	Ether thinkest thou that I cannot now praye to my father and he shall geve me moo then . xii . legions of angelles ?
40026054	But how then shuld the scriptures be fulfylled : for so must it be .
40026055	The same tyme sayd Iesus to the multitude : ye be come out as it were vnto a thefe with sweardes and staves for to take me . I sate daylie teachinge in the temple amoge you and ye toke me not .
40026056	All this was done that the scriptures of the Prophetes myght be fulfilled .
40026057	Then all the disciples forsoke him and fleed . And they toke Iesus and leed him to Cayphas the hye preeste where the Scribes and the Elders where assembled .
40026058	And Peter folowed him a farre of vnto the hye prestes place : and went in and sate with the servauntes to se the ende .
40026059	The chefe prestes and the elders and all the counsell sought false witnes agenste Iesus for to put him to deeth
40026060	but founde none : in somoche that when many false witnesses cam yet founde they none . At the last came two false witnesses
40026061	and sayd : This felowe sayde : I can distroye the temple of God and bylde it agayne in . iii . dayes .
40026062	And the chefe preste arose and sayde to him : answerest thou nothinge ? How is it yt these beare witnes ageynst the ?
40026063	But Iesus helde his peace : And the chefe Preeste answered and sayd to him : I charge the in the name of the lyvinge God that thou tell vs whether thou be Christ the sonne of God .
40026064	Iesus sayd to him : thou haste sayd . Neverthelesse I saye vnto you hereafter shall ye se the sonne of ma syttinge on the right honde of power and come in the clowddes of the skye .
40026065	Then the hye preste rent his clothes sayinge : He hath blasphemed : what nede we of eny moo witnesses ? Behold now ye have hearde his blasphemy :
40026066	what thinke ye ? They answered and sayd : he his worthy to dye .
40026067	Then spat they in his face and boffeted him with fistes . And other smote him with the palme af their hondes
40026068	on ye face sayinge : tell vs thou Christ who is he that smote the ?
40026069	Peter sate with out in the palice . And a damsell came to him sayinge : Thou also waste wt Iesus of Galilee :
40026070	but he denyed before the all sayinge : I woot not what thou sayst .
40026071	When he was goone out into the poorche another wenche sawe him and sayde vnto them that were there : This felowe was also with Iesus of Nazareth .
40026072	And agayne he denyed with an oothe that he knew the man .
40026073	And after a whyle came vnto him they yt stode bye and sayde vnto Peter : suerly thou arte even one of the for thy speache bewreyeth ye .
40026074	Then beganne he to course and to sweare that he knewe not the man . And immedyatly the cocke krewe .
40026075	And Peter remembred the wordes of Iesu which sayde vnto him : before the cocke crowe thou shalt deny me thryse : and went out at the dores and wepte bitterly .
40027001	When the mornynge was come all ye chefe prestes and the elders of ye people helde a counsayle agenst Iesu to put him to deeth
40027002	and brought him bounde and delivered him vnto Poncius Pilate the debite .
40027003	Then when Iudas which betrayed him sawe that he was condempned he repented him sylfe and brought ageyne the . xxx . plattes of sylver to ye chefe prestes and elders
40027004	sayinge : I have synned betrayinge the innocent bloud . And they sayde : what is that to vs ? Se thou to that .
40027005	And he cast doune the sylver plattes in the temple and departed and went and hounge him sylfe .
40027006	And the chefe prestes toke the sylver plattes and sayd : it is not lawfull for to put them in to the treasury because it is the pryce of bloud .
40027007	And they toke counsell and bought with them a potters felde to bury strangers in .
40027008	Wherfore that felde is called the felde of bloud vntyll this daye .
40027009	Then was fulfylled that which was spoken by Ieremy the Prophet sayinge : and they toke . xxx . sylver plattes the prise of him that was valued whom they bought of the chyldren of Israel
40027010	and they gave them for the potters felde as the Lorde appoynted me .
40027011	Iesus stode before the debite : and the debite axed him sayinge : Arte thou the kynge of ye Iues ? Iesus sayd vnto him : Thou sayest
40027012	and when he was accused of ye chefe prestes and elders he answered nothinge .
40027013	Then sayd Pilate vnto him : hearest thou not how many thinges they laye ageynste ye ?
40027014	And he answered him to never a worde : in so moche that the debite marveylled greatlie .
40027015	At that feest the debite was wonte to deliver vnto ye people a presoner whom they wolde desyer .
40027016	He had then a notable presoner called Barrabas .
40027017	And when they were gadered together Pilate sayde vnto the : whether wyll ye that I geve losse vnto you Barrabas or Iesus which is called Christ ?
40027018	For he knewe well that for envie they had delivred him .
40027019	When he was set doune to geve iudgemet his wyfe sent to him sayinge : have thou nothinge to do with that iuste man . For I have suffered many thinges this daye in a dreame about him .
40027020	But the chefe preestes and the elders had parswaded the people that they shulde axe Barrabas and shulde destroye Iesus .
40027021	Then the debite answered and sayde vnto them : whether of the twayne wyll ye that I let loosse vnto you ? And they sayde Barrabas .
40027022	Pilate sayde vnto them : what shall I do then with Iesus which is called Christ ? They all sayde to him : let him be crucified .
40027023	Then sayde the debite : what evyll hath he done ? And they cryed the more sayinge : let him be crucified .
40027024	When Pilate sawe that he prevayled nothinge but that moare busines was made he toke water and wasshed his hondes before ye people sayinge : I am innocent of the bloud of this iuste person and that ye shall se .
40027025	Then answered all the people and sayde : his bloud be on vs and on oure chyldren .
40027026	Then let he Barrabas loose vnto them and scourged Iesus and delivered him to be crucified .
40027027	Then the soudeours of the debite toke Iesus vnto the comen hall and gaddered vnto him all the company .
40027028	And they stripped him and put on him a purpyll roobe
40027029	and platted a croune of thornes and put vpon his heed and a rede in his ryght honde : and bowed their knees before him and mocked him saying : hayle kinge of the Iewes :
40027030	and spitted vpon him and toke the rede and smoote him on the heed .
40027031	And when they had mocked him they toke the robe of him ageyne and put his awne reymet on him and leed him awaye to crucify him .
40027032	And as they came out they fonnde a man of Cyren named Simon : him they compelled to beare his crosse .
40027033	And whe they cam vnto ye place called Golgotha ( that is to saye a place of deed mens sculles )
40027034	they gave him veneger to drinke mengled with gall . And when he had tasted therof he wolde not drinke .
40027035	When they had crucified him they parted his garmentes and did cast lottes : to fulfyll that was spoken by the prophet . They deuyded my garmetes amonge them : and apon my vesture did cast loottes .
40027036	And they sate and watched him there .
40027037	And they set vp over his heed the cause of his deeth written . This is Iesus the kynge of the Iewes .
40027038	And ther were two theves crucified with him one on ye right honde and another on the lyfte .
40027039	They that passed by revyled him waggynge ther heeddes
40027040	and sayinge : Thou that destroyest the temple of God and byldest it in thre dayes save thy sylfe . If thou be ye sonne of God come doune from the crosse .
40027041	Lykwyse also the hye prestes mockinge him with the scribes aud elders sayde :
40027042	He saved other him sylfe he can not save . If he be ye kynge of Israel : let him now come doune from the crosse and we will beleve him .
40027043	He trusted in God let him deliver him now yf he will have him : for he sayde I am the sonne of God .
40027044	That same also the theves which were crucified with him cast in his tethe .
40027045	From the sixte houre was there dercknes over all the londe vnto the nynth houre .
40027046	And about ye nynth houre Iesus cryed with a loude voyce sayinge : Eli Eli lama asbathani . That is to saye my God my God why hast thou forsaken me ?
40027047	Some of them that stode there when they herde that sayde : This man calleth for Helyas .
40027048	And streyght waye one of them ranne and toke a sponge and filled it full of veneger and put it on a rede and gave him to drinke .
40027049	Other sayde let be : let vs se whyther Helyas will come and deliver him .
40027050	Iesus cryed agayne with a lowde voyce and yelded vp the goost .
40027051	And beholde the vayle of the temple dyd rent in twayne from ye toppe to the bottome and the erth dyd quake and the stones dyd rent
40027052	and graves dyd open : and the bodies of many sainctes which slept arose
40027053	and came out of ye graves after his resurreccion and came into the holy cite and appered vnto many .
40027054	When the Centurion and they that were with him watchinge Iesus sawe ye erth quake and those thinges which hapened they feared greatly sayinge . Of a surete this was the sonne of God .
40027055	And many wemen were there beholdinge him a farre of which folowed Iesus fro Galile ministringe vnto him .
40027056	Amonge which was Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of Iames and Ioses and ye mother of zebedes chyldren .
40027057	When the even was come there came a ryche man of Aramathia named Ioseph which same also was Iesus disciple .
40027058	He went to Pilate and begged the body of Iesus . Then Pilate commaunded the body to be delivered .
40027059	And Ioseph toke the body and wrapped it in a clene lynnyn clooth
40027060	and put it in his newe tombe which he had hewen out even in the roke and rolled a greate stone to the dore of ye sepulcre and departed .
40027061	And there was Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sittynge over ageynste the sepulcre .
40027062	The nexte daye that foloweth good frydaye the hye prestes and pharises got them selves to Pilate
40027063	and sayde : Syr we remember yt this deceaver sayde whyll he was yet alyve After thre dayes I will aryse agayne .
40027064	Commaunde therfore that the sepulcre be made sure vntyll ye thyrd daye lest paraventure his disciples come and steale him awaye and saye vnto the people he is rysen from deeth and the laste erroure be worsse then the fyrst .
40027065	Pilate sayde vnto them . Take watche men : Go and make it as sure as ye can .
40027066	And they went and made the sepulcre sure with watche men and sealed the stone .
40028001	The Sabboth daye at even which dauneth the morowe after the Sabboth Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to se the sepulcre .
40028002	And beholde ther was a greate erth quake . For the angell of ye lorde descended from heven : and came and rowlled backe the stone from the dore and sate apon it .
40028003	His countenaunce was lyke lyghtnynge and his raymet whyte as snowe .
40028004	And for feare of him the kepers were astunnyed and became as deed men .
40028005	The angell answered and sayde to the wemen feare ye not . I knowe yt ye seke Iesus which was crucified :
40028006	he is not here : he is rysen as he sayde . Come and se the place where the lorde was put :
40028007	and goo quickly and tell his disciples yt he is rysen from deeth . And beholde he will go before you into Galile there ye shall se him . Lo I have tolde you .
40028008	And they departed quickly from the sepulcre with feare and greate Ioye : and did runne to bringe his disciples worde .
40028009	And as they went to tell his disciples : beholde Iesus met them sayinge : All hayle . And they came and held him by the fete and worshipped him .
40028010	The sayde Iesus vnto them : be not afrayde . Go and tell my brethren that they goo in to Galile and there shall they se me .
40028011	When they were gone : beholde some of the kepers came into the cyte and shewed vnto the hie prestes all the thinges that were hapened .
40028012	And they gaddered them to gedder with the elders and toke counsell and gave large money vnto the soudiers
40028013	sayinge : Saye that his disciples came by nyght and stole him awaye whill ye slept .
40028014	And if this come to the rulers cares we wyll pease him and save you harmeles .
40028015	And they toke the money and dyd as they were taught . And this sayinge is noysed amoge the Iewes vnto this daye .
40028016	Then the . xi . disciples went awaye into Galile in to a mountayne where Iesus had appoynted them .
40028017	And when they sawe hym they worshipped him . But some of them douted .
40028018	And Iesus came and spake vnto them sayinge : All power ys geve vnto me in heve and in erth .
40028019	Go therfore and teache all nacions baptysinge them in the name of the father and the sonne and the holy goost :
40028020	Teachinge them to observe all thynges what soever I comcommaunded you . And lo I am with you all waye even vntyll the ende of the worlde .
41001001	The beginnynge of the Gospell of Iesu Christ the sonne of God
41001002	as yt is wrytten in the Prophetes : beholde I sende my messenger before thy face which shall prepared thy waye before ye .
41001003	The voyce of a cryer in the wildernes : prepare ye the waye of the Lorde make his paches streyght .
41001004	Iohn dyd baptise in the wyldernes and preche the baptyme of repentauce for the remission of synnes .
41001005	And all the londe of Iurie and they of Ierusalem went out vnto him and were all baptised of him in the ryver Iordan confessynge their synnes .
41001006	Iohn was clothed with cammylles heer and with a gerdyll of a skyn a bout hys loynes . And he dyd eate locustes and wylde hony
41001007	and preached sayinge : a stronger then I commeth after me whose shue latchet I am not worthy to stoupe doune and vnlose .
41001008	I have baptised you with water : but he shall baptise you with the holy goost .
41001009	And yt came to passe in those dayes that Iesus cam from Nazareth a cyte of Galile : and was baptised of Iohn in Iordan .
41001010	And assone as he was come out of the water Iohn sawe heaven open and the holy goost descendinge vpon him lyke a dove .
41001011	And ther came a voyce from heaven : Thou arte my dere sonne in whom I delyte .
41001012	And immediatly the sprete drave him into wildernes :
41001013	and he was there in the wildernes xl dayes and was tempted of Satan and was with wilde beestes . And the aungels ministred vnto him .
41001014	After Iohn was taken Iesus came in to Galile preachinge the gospell of the kyngdome of God
41001015	and sayinge : the tyme is come and the kyngdome of God is at honde repent and beleve the gospell .
41001016	As he walked by the see of Galile he sawe Simon and Andrew his brother castinge nettes into ye see for they were fysshers .
41001017	And Iesus sayde vnto them : folowe me and I will make you fisshers of men .
41001018	And strayght waye they forsoke their nettes and folowed him .
41001019	And when he had gone a lytell further thence he sawe Iames the sonne of zebede and Ihon his brother even as they were in the shyppe mendinge their nettes .
41001020	And anone he called them . And they leeft their father zebede in the shippe with his hyred servauntes and went their waye after him .
41001021	And they entred into Capernau : and streight waye on ye Saboth dayes he entred in to ye synagoge and taught .
41001022	And they merveled at his learninge . For he taught them as one that had power with him and not as the Scribes .
41001023	And there was in their synagoge a ma vexed wt an vnclene spirite yt cried
41001024	sayinge : let be : what have we to do with the thou Iesus of Nazareth ? Arte thou come to destroye vs ? I knowe the what thou arte eue that holy of god .
41001025	And Iesus rebuked him sayinge : hoolde thy peace and come out of him .
41001026	And ye vnclene spirite tare him and cryed with a loude voyce and came out of him .
41001027	And they were all amased in so moche that they demaunded one of another amoge them selves saying : what thinge is this ? what newe doctryne is this ? For he comaundeth the foule spirites with power and they obeye him .
41001028	And immediatly his fame spreed abroade throughoute all the region borderinge on Galile .
41001029	And forth with as sone as they were come out of the synagoge they entred into ye housse of Symon and Andrew with Iames and Ihon .
41001030	And Symons mother in lawe lay sicke of a fever . And anone they tolde him of her .
41001031	And he came and toke her by the honde and lifte her vp : and the fever forsoke hir by and by : and she ministred vnto them .
41001032	And at even when the sunne was downe they brought to him all that were diseased and them that were possessed with devyls .
41001033	And all the cite gaddred to gedder at the dore
41001034	and he healed many yt were sicke of divers deseases . And he cast out many devyls and suffred not ye devyls to speake because they knewe him .
41001035	And in the morninge very erly Iesus arose and went out into a solitary place and there prayed .
41001036	And Simon and they that were with him folowed after him .
41001037	And when they had founde him they sayde vnto him : all men seke for the .
41001038	And he sayd vnto them : let vs go into the next tounes that I maye preache there also : for truly I cam out for that purpose .
41001039	And he preached in their synagoges throughout all Galile and cast the devyls out .
41001040	And there came a leper to him besechinge him and kneled doune vnto him and sayde to him : yf thou wilt thou canest make me clene .
41001041	And Iesus had copassion on him and put forth his honde touched him and sayde to him : I will be thou clene .
41001042	And assone as he had spoke immediatly ye leprosy departed fro him and was clensed .
41001043	And he charged him and sent him awaye forthwith
41001044	and sayd vnto him : Se thou saye no thinge to any man : but get the hence and shewe thy silfe to ye preste and offer for thy clensinge those thinges which Moses comaunded for a testimoniall vnto them .
41001045	But he ( assone as he was departed ) beganne to tell many thinges and to publyshe the dede : in so moche that Iesus coulde no more opely entre in to the cite but was with out in desert places . And they came to him fro every quarter .
41002001	After a feawe dayes he entred into Capernaum agayne and it was noysed that he was in a housse .
41002002	And anone many gadered to geder in so moche that now there was no roume to receave them : no not so moche as about the dore . And he preached the worde vnto them .
41002003	And there came vnto him that brought one sicke of the palsie borne of fower men .
41002004	And because they coulde not come nye vnto him for preace they vncovered ye rofe of the housse where he was . And when they had broken it ope they let doune ye beed where in ye sicke of the palsie laye .
41002005	When Iesus sawe their fayth he sayde to the sicke of the palsie sonne thy sinnes are forgeven the .
41002006	And ther were certayne of ye scribes sittinge there and reasoninge in their hertes :
41002007	how doeth this felowe so blaspheme ? Who can forgeve synnes but God only ?
41002008	And immediatly whe Iesus perceaved in his sprete yt they so reasoned in the selves he sayde vnto them : why thynke ye soche thinges in youre hertes ?
41002009	Whether is it easyer to saye to ye sicke of ye palsie thy synnes are forgeven the or to saye aryse take vp thy beed and walke ?
41002010	That ye maye knowe yt the sonne of man hath power in erth to forgeve synnes he spake vnto ye sicke of the palsie :
41002011	I saye vnto ye aryse and take vp thy beed and get ye hense into thyne awne housse .
41002012	And by and by he arose toke vp the beed and went forth before them all : in so moche that they were all amased and glorified God sayinge : we never sawe it on this fassion .
41002013	And he went agayne vnto the see and all the people resorted vnto him and he taught the .
41002014	And as Iesus passed by he sawe Levy ye sonne of Alphey syt at the receyte of custome and sayde vnto him : folowe me . And he arose and folowed him .
41002015	And it came to passe as Iesus sate at meate in his housse many publicans and synners sate at meate also with Iesus and his disciples . For there were many that folowed him .
41002016	And when the Scribes and Pharises sawe him eate with publicas and synnere they sayde vnto his disciples : how is it that he eateth and drynketh with publicas and synners ?
41002017	When Iesus hearde yt he sayde vnto them . The whole have no nede of the phisicio but the sicke . I came not to call the rightwise but the synners to repentaunce .
41002018	And the disciples of Iohn and the Pharises dyd faste : and therfore came and sayde vnto him . Why do ye disciples of Iohn and of the Pharises faste and thy disciples fast not .
41002019	And Iesus sayde vnto them : can the chyldren of a weddinge faste while the brydgrome is wt them . As longe as they have the brydgrome with them they cannot faste .
41002020	But the dayes will come when the brydgrome shalbe taken from them and then shall they faste in those dayes .
41002021	Also no ma soweth a pece of newe cloth vnto an olde garmet for then taketh he awaye ye newe pece fro the olde and so is the rent worsse .
41002022	In lyke wyse no man poureth newe wyne into olde vessels : for yf he do the newe wyne breaketh the vessels and the wyne runneth out and the vessels are marred . But new wyne must be poured into new vessels .
41002023	And it chaunsed that he wet thorow ye corne feldes on the Saboth daye : and his disciples as they went on their waye beganne to plucke the eares of corne .
41002024	And the Pharises sayde vnto him : beholde why do they on the Saboth dayes yt which is not laufull ?
41002025	And he sayde to them : have ye never rede what David dyd when he had nede and was anhogred bothe he and they that were with him ?
41002026	How he went into the housse of God in the dayes of Abiathar ye hye preste and dyd eate ye halowed loves which is not laufull to eate but for ye prestes only : and gave also to the which were with him ?
41002027	And he sayde to them : the Saboth daye was made for man and not man for the Saboth daye .
41002028	Wherfore the sonne of man is Lorde eve of the Saboth daye .
41003001	And he entred agayne into ye synagoge and there was a man there which had a widdred honde .
41003002	And they watched him to se whether he wolde heale him on the Saboth daye yt they might accuse him .
41003003	And he sayde vnto ye man which had ye wyddred honde : arise and stonde in ye middes .
41003004	And he sayd to them : whether is it laufull to do a good dede on ye Saboth dayes or an evyll ? to save life or kyll ? But they helde their peace .
41003005	And he loked round aboute on them angerly mournyge on the blindnes of their hertes and sayde to the man : stretch forth thyne honde . And he stretched it oute . And his honde was restored even as whole as the other .
41003006	And ye Pharises departed and streyght waye gaddred a counsell with the that belonged to Herode agaynst him yt they might destroye him .
41003007	And Iesus auoyded wt his disciples to ye sea . And a greate multitude folowed him fro Galile and fro Iurie
41003008	and fro Hierusalem and fro Idumea and fro beyonde Iordane : and they yt dwelled about Tyre and Sidon a greate multitude : which whe they had herde what thinges he dyd came vnto him .
41003009	And he comaunded his disciples yt a shippe shuld wayte on him because of the people leste they shuld througe him .
41003010	For he had healed many in somoche that they preased apon him for to touche him as many as had plages .
41003011	And when the vnclene sprites sawe him they fell doune before him and cryed sayinge : thou arte the sonne of God .
41003012	And he straygtly charged them that they shuld not vtter him .
41003013	And he wet vp into a mountayne and called vnto him whom he wolde and they came vnto him .
41003014	And he ordeyned ye . xii . that they shuld be wt him and that he myght sende the to preache :
41003015	and that they might have power to heale syknesses and to cast out devyls .
41003016	And he gave vnto Simon to name Peter .
41003017	And he called Iames the sonne of zebede and Iohn Iames brother and gave them Bonarges to name which is to saye the sonnes of thounder .
41003018	And Andrew and Philip and Bartlemew and Mathew and Thomas and Iames the sonne of Alphey and Taddeus and Symon of Cane
41003019	and Iudas Iscarioth which same also betrayed him . And they came vnto housse
41003020	and the people assembled togedder agayne so greatly that they had not leesar so moche as to eate breed .
41003021	And when they that longed vnto him hearde of it they went out to holde him . For they thought he had bene beside him selfe .
41003022	And ye Scribes which came fro Ierusalem sayde : he hath Belzebub and by ye power of the chefe devyll casteth out devyls .
41003023	And he called them vnto him and sayde vnto them in similitudes . How can Satan drive out Satan ?
41003024	For yf a realme be devided ageynste it silfe that realme cannot endure .
41003025	Or yf a housse be devided agaynste it silfe that housse cannot continue :
41003026	So yf Sata make insurreccion agaynste himsilfe and be devided he cannot continue but is at an ende .
41003027	No man can entre into a stronge mans housse and take awaye hys gooddes excepte he fyrst bynde that stronge man and then spoyle hys housse .
41003028	Verely I saye vnto you all synnes shalbe forgeven vnto mens chyldren and blasphemy wherwith they blaspheme .
41003029	But he that blasphemeth ye holy goost shall never have forgevenes : but is in dauger of eternall dapnacion :
41003030	because they sayde he had an vnclene sprete .
41003031	Then came his mother and his brethre and stode with out and sent vnto him and called him .
41003032	And the people sate aboute hym and sayde vnto him : beholde thy mother and thy brethre seke for the with out .
41003033	And he answered them sayinge : who is my mother and my brethre ?
41003034	And he loked rounde about on his disciples which sate in compasse about hym and sayde : beholde my mother and my brethren .
41003035	For whosoever doeth ye will of God he is my brother my syster and mother .
41004001	And he began agayne to teache by the seesyde . And there gadered to gedder vnto him moche people so greatly yt he entred into a ship and sate in the see and all the people was by the seeside on the shoore .
41004002	And he taught them many thynges in similitudes and sayde vnto them in his doctrine :
41004003	Herken to . Beholde There wet out a sower to sowe .
41004004	And it fortuned as he sowed that some fell by the waye syde and the fowles of the ayre came and devoured it vp .
41004005	Some fell on stony grounde where it had not moche erth : and by and by sprange vp because it had not deepth of erth :
41004006	but as sone as the sunne was vp it caught heet and because it had not rotynge wyddred awaye .
41004007	And some fell amonge the thornes and the thornes grewe vp and choked it so that it gave no frute .
41004008	And some fell vpon good grounde and dyd yelde frute that sproge and grewe and brought forthe : some thirty folde some sixtie folde and some an hundred folde .
41004009	And he sayde vnto them : he that hath eares to heare let him heare .
41004010	And when he was alone they yt were aboute him with ye . xii . axed him of ye similitude .
41004011	And he sayde vnto the . To you it is geve to knowe the mistery of the kyngdome of God . But vnto them that are wt out shall all thinges be done in similitudes :
41004012	yt when they se they shall se and not discerne : and when they heare they shall heare and not vnderstonde : leste at any tyme they shulde tourne and their synnes shuld be forgeve the .
41004013	And he sayde vnto the : Perceave ye not this similitude ? how then shulde ye vnderstonde all other similitudes ?
41004014	The sower soweth ye worde .
41004015	And they that are by the wayes syde where the worde is sowen are they to whom assone as they have herde it Satha cometh immediatly and takith awaye the worde that was sowe in their hertes .
41004016	And likewise they that are sowen on the stonye groude are they : which when they have harde the worde at once receave it wt gladnes
41004017	yet have no rotes in them selves and so endure but a tyme : and anone as trouble and persecucion aryseth for ye wordes sake they fall immediatly .
41004018	And they that are sowe amoge the thornes are soche as heare ye worde :
41004019	and ye care of this worlde and ye disseytfulnes of ryches and the lustes of other thinges entre in and choocke ye worde and it is made vnfrutfull .
41004020	And those that weare sowe in good grounde are they that heare the worde and receave it and bringe forth frute some thirty folde some sixty folde some an hundred folde .
41004021	And he sayde vnto them : is ye candle lighted to be put vnder a busshell or vnder ye table and not rather to be put on a cadelstick ?
41004022	For there is nothinge so prevy that shall not be opened : nether so secreet but that it shall come abroade .
41004023	Yf eny man have eares to heare let him heare .
41004024	And he sayde vnto them : take hede what ye heare . With what measure ye mete with the same shall it be measured vnto you agayne . And vnto you that heare shall more be geve .
41004025	For vnto him yt hath shall it be geven : and from him that hath not shalbe taken awaye even that he hath .
41004026	And he sayde : so is the kyngdome of God even as yf a man shuld sowe seed in ye groude
41004027	and shulde slepe and ryse vp night and daye : and the seede shuld springe and growe vp he not ware .
41004028	For ye erth bringeth forthe frute of her silfe : fyrst the blade then the eares after that full corne in the eares .
41004029	And as sone as the frute is brought forth anone he throusteth in ye sykell because the hervest is come .
41004030	And he sayde : where vnto shall we lyke the kyngdome of God ? or with what copareson shall we copare it ?
41004031	It is lyke a grayne of mustard seed which when it is sowe in the erth is the leest of all seedes that be in the erth :
41004032	but after that it is sowen it groweth vp and is greatest of all yerbes : and bereth greate brauches so that ye fowles of the ayre maye dwell vnder the shadowe of it .
41004033	And with many soche similitudes he preached the worde vnto the after as they myght heare it .
41004034	And with out similitude spake he no thinge vnto them . But when they were aparte he expounded all thinges to his disciples .
41004035	And the same daye when even was come he sayde vnto them : let vs passe over vnto the other syde .
41004036	And they lefte the people and toke him even as he was in the shyp . And ther were also with him other shippes .
41004037	And ther arose a great storme of wynde and dasshed ye waves into the ship so that it was full .
41004038	And he was in the sterne a slepe on a pelowe . And they awoke him and sayde to him : Master carest thou not yt we perisshe ?
41004039	And he rose vp and rebuked the wynde and sayde vnto the see : peace and be still . And the winde alayed and ther folowed a greate calme .
41004040	And he sayde vnto them : why are ye so fearfull ? How is it that ye have no fayth ?
41004041	And they feared excedingly and sayde one to another : what felowe is this ? For booth winde and see obey him .
41005001	And they cam over to the other syde of ye see in to the coutre of ye Gaderenites .
41005002	And when he was come out of ye shippe there met him out of the graves a man possessyd of an vncleane sprete
41005003	which had his abydinge amoge the graves . And no man coulde bynde him : no not with cheynes
41005004	because that when he was often bounde wt fetters and cheynes he plucked ye chaynes asundre and brake the fetters in peaces . Nether coulde eny man tame him .
41005005	And alwayes bothe nyght and daye he cryed in ye moutaynes and in ye graves and bet himsilfe wt stones .
41005006	When he had spied Iesus afarre of he rane and worshipped him
41005007	and cryed wt a lowde voyce and sayde : what have I to do wt the Iesus ye sonne of the moost hyest God ? I requyre ye in the name of God yt thou tormet me not .
41005008	For he had sayd vnto hym : come out of the man thou fowle sprete .
41005009	And he axed him : what is thy name ? And he answered sayinge : my name is Legion for we are many .
41005010	And he prayd him instantly that he wolde not sende the awaye out of the countre .
41005011	And ther was there nye vnto ye moutayns a greate heerd of swyne fedinge
41005012	and all the devyls besought him sayinge : sende vs into the heerde of swyne yt we maye enter in to them .
41005013	And anone Iesus gave them leave . And the vnclene spretes wet out and entred into ye swyne . And the heerd starteled and ran hedling into the see . They were about . ii . M . swyne and they were drouned in the see .
41005014	And the swyne heerdes fleed and tolde it in ye cyte and in the countre . And they came out for to se what had hapened :
41005015	and came to Iesus and sawe hym that was vexed wt the fende and had the legio syt both clothed and in his right mynde and were afrayed .
41005016	And they that sawe it tolde them how it had happened vnto him that was possessed with the devyll : and also of the swyne .
41005017	And they begane to praye him that he wolde departe fro their coostes .
41005018	And when he was come in to the shyppe he that had ye devyll prayed him that he myght be with him .
41005019	Howbeit Iesus wolde not suffre him but sayde vnto him : goo home in to thyne awne housse and to thy frendes and shewe the what great thinges ye Lorde hath done vnto the and how he had copassion on the .
41005020	And he departed and begane to publisshe in ye ten cyties what greate thinges Iesus had done vnto him and all me dyd merveyle .
41005021	And when Iesus was come over agayne by shyp vnto the other syde moche people gadered vnto him and he was nye vnto the see .
41005022	And beholde ther came one of the rulers of ye Synagoge whose name was Iairus : and when he sawe him he fell doune at his fete
41005023	and besought hym greatly sayinge : my doughter lyith at poynt of deeth I wolde thou woldest come and laye thy honde on her that she myght be safe and live .
41005024	And he wet with him and moche people folowed him and thronged him .
41005025	And ther was a certen woman which was diseased of an yssue of bloude . xii . yeres
41005026	and had suffred many thinges of many phisicios and had spet all yt she had and felte none amendmet at all but wexed worsse and worsse .
41005027	When she had herde of Iesus : she came into the preace behynde him and touched his garmet .
41005028	For she thought : yf I maye but touche his clothes I shall be whole .
41005029	And streyght waye her foutayne of bloude was dryed vp aud she felt in her body that she was healed of the plage .
41005030	And Iesus immediatly felt in him silfe ye vertue that wet out of him and tourned him roude aboute in the preace and sayde : who touched my clothes ?
41005031	And his disciples sayde vnto him : seist thou ye people thrust the and yet axest who dyd touche me ?
41005032	And he loked roud about for to se her that had done that thinge .
41005033	The woman feared and trembled ( for she knew what was done with in her ) and she came and fell doune before him and tolde him ye truth of everythinge .
41005034	And he sayde to her : Doughter thy fayth hath made the whoale : goo in peace and be whole of thy plage .
41005035	Whyll he yet spake ther came fro the ruler of ye synagoges housse certayne which sayde : thy doughter is deed : why diseasest thou ye master eny further ?
41005036	Assone as Iesus herde that worde spoke he sayde vnto the ruler of ye synagoge : be not afrayed only beleve .
41005037	And he suffred no man to folowe him moo then Peter and Iames and Ihon the brother of Iames .
41005038	And he came vnto the housse of the ruler of ye synagoge and sawe ye wondrynge and them that wepte and wayled greatly
41005039	and went in and sayde vnto them : why make ye this adoo and wepe ? The mayde is not deed but slepith .
41005040	And they lawght him to scorne . Then he put them all out and toke ye father and the mother of ye mayden and them that were with him and entred in where the mayden laye
41005041	and toke the mayden by the honde and sayde vnto hyr : Tabitha cumi : which is by interpretacion : mayde I saye vnto the aryse .
41005042	And streyght the mayden arose and went on her fete . For she was of the age of twelve yeres . And they were astonied at it out of measure .
41005043	And he charged the straytely that no man shuld knowe of it and comaunded to geve her meate .
41006001	And he departed thence and cam into his awne countre and his disciples folowed him .
41006002	And whe the saboth daye was come he beganne to teache in ye synagsge . And many that hearde him were astonyed and sayde : From whens hath he these thinges ? and what wysdo is this that is geve vnto him ? and suche vertues yt are wrought by his hondes ?
41006003	Is not this that carpeter Maryes sonne ye brother of Iames and Ioses and of Iuda and Simon ? and are not his systers here with vs ? And they were offended by him .
41006004	And Iesus sayde vnto the : a prophet is not despysed but in his awne coutre and amonge his awne kynne and amonge the that are of the same housholde .
41006005	And he coulde there shewe no miracles but leyd his hondes apon a feawe sicke foolke and healed the .
41006006	And he merveyled at their vnbelefe . And he went aboute by ye tounes yt laye on every syde teachynge .
41006007	And he called ye twelve and beganne to sende them two and two and gave them power over vnclene spretes .
41006008	And comaunded the that they shuld take nothinge vnto their Iorney save a rodde only : Nether scrippe nether breed nether mony in their pourses :
41006009	but shuld be shood with sandals . And that they shuld not put on two coottes .
41006010	And he sayd vnto the : whersoever ye entre in to an house there abyde tyll ye departe thence
41006011	And whosoever shall not receave you nor heare you when ye departe thence shake of the duste that is vnder youre fete for a witnesse vnto them . I saye verely vnto you it shalbe easyer for Zodom and Gomor at the daye of iudgement then for that cite .
41006012	And they went out and preached that they shuld repent :
41006013	and they caste out many devylles . And they annoynted many that were sicke with oyle and healed them .
41006014	And kynge Herode herde of him ( for his name was spreed abroade ) and sayd : Iohn Baptiste is rysen agayne from deeth and therfore miracles are wrought by him .
41006015	Wother sayd it is Helyas : and some sayde : it is a Prophet or as one of ye Prophetes .
41006016	But when Herode hearde of him he sayd : it is Iohn whom I beheded he is rysen from deeth agayne .
41006017	For Herode him sylfe had sent forth and had taken Iohn and bounde him and cast him into preson for Herodias sake which was his brother Philippes wyfe . For he had maried her .
41006018	Iohn sayd vnto Herode : It is not laufull for the to have thy brothers wyfe .
41006019	Herodias layd wayte for him and wolde have killed him but she coulde not .
41006020	For Herode feared Iohn knowynge yt he was a iuste man and an holy : and gave him reverence : and when he hearde him he dyd many thinges and hearde him gladly .
41006021	But when a couenient daye was come : Herode on his birth daye made a supper to ye lordes captayns and chefe estates of Galile .
41006022	And ye doughter of ye sayde Herodias came in and daused and pleased Herode and them that sate at bourde also . Then ye kynge sayd vnto ye mayden : axe of me what thou wilt and I will geve it ye
41006023	And he sware vnto hyr whatsoever thou shalt axe of me I will geve it ye even vnto ye one halfe of my kyngdome .
41006024	And she wet forth and sayde to her mother : what shall I axe ? And she sayde : Iohn Baptistes heed .
41006025	And she cam in streygth waye with haste vnto ye kynge and axed sayinge : I will that thou geve me by and by in a charger ye heed of Iohn Baptist .
41006026	And ye kynge was sory : howbe it for his othes sake and for their sakes which sate at supper also he wolde not put her besyde her purpose .
41006027	And immediatly ye kynge sent ye hangma and comaunded his heed to be brought in . And he went and beheeded him in the preson
41006028	and brought his heed in a charger and gave it to the mayden and the mayden gave it to her mother .
41006029	And when his disciples hearde of it they came and toke vp his body and put it in a toumbe .
41006030	And the apostels gaddered them selves to ggedre to Iesus and tolde him all thinges booth what they had done and what they had taught .
41006031	And he sayd vnto them : come ye aparte into the wyldernes and rest awhyle . For there were many comers and goers that they had no leasure so moche as to eate .
41006032	And he wet by ship out of the waye into a deserte place .
41006033	But the people spyed them when they departed : and many knewe him and ranne afote thyther out of all cities and cam thyther before them and came togedder vnto him .
41006034	And Iesus went out and sawe moche people and had compassion on them because they were lyke shepe which had no shepeherde . And he beganne to teache them many thinges .
41006035	And when ye daye was nowe farre spet his disciples came vnto him sayinge : this is a desert place and now the daye is farre passed
41006036	let the departe that they maye goo into the countrey rounde about and into the tounes and bye the breed : for they have nothinge to eate .
41006037	He answered and sayde vnto them : geve ye the to eate . And they sayde vnto him : shall we goo and bye ii . C . penyworth of breed and geve the to eate ?
41006038	He sayde vnto the : how many loves have ye ? Goo and loke . And when they had serched they sayde : v . and . ii . fysshes .
41006039	And he comaunded them to make them all syt doune by companyes apon the grene grasse .
41006040	And they sate doune here a rowe and there arowe by houndredes and by fyfties .
41006041	And he toke ye . v . loves and ye ii . fysshes and loked vp to heven and blessed and brake the loves and gave them to his disciples to put before the : and the . ii . fysshes he devyded amonge them all .
41006042	And they all dyd eate and were satisfied .
41006043	And they toke vp twelve baskettesfull of the gobbettes and of ye fysshes .
41006044	And they that ate were about fyve thousand men .
41006045	And streyght waye he caused his disciples to goo into the shipe and to goo over the water before vnto Bethsaida whyll he sent awaye the people .
41006046	And assone as he had sent them away he departed into a moutayne to praye .
41006047	And when even was come the ship was in the middes of the see and he alone on the londe
41006048	and he sawe the troubled in rowynge for the wynde was cotrary vnto them . And aboute ye fourth quartre of ye nyght he came vnto the walkinge apon the see and wolde have passed by the .
41006049	When they sawe him walkinge apon the see they supposed it had bene a sprete and cryed oute :
41006050	For they all sawe him and were afrayed . And anon he talked with them and sayde vnto them : be of good chere it is I be not afrayed .
41006051	And he went vp vnto them into the shippe and the wynde ceased and they were sore amased in them selves beyonde measure and marveyled .
41006052	For they remembred not of the loves because their hertes were blynded .
41006053	And they came over and went into the londe of Genezareth and drue vp into the haven .
41006054	And assone as they were come out of ye shippe streyght they knewe him
41006055	and ran forth throughout all ye region rounde about and began to cary aboute in beeddes all yt were sicke to the place where they heard tell yt he was .
41006056	And whyther soever he entred into tounes cities or villages they layde their sicke in the stretes and prayed him that they myght touche and it were but the edge of his vesture . And as many as touched him were safe .
41007001	And ye pharises came togedder vnto him and dyvers of ye scribes which came from Ierusalem .
41007002	And whe they sawe certayne of his disciples eate breed wt comen hondes ( that is to saye wt vnwesshen hondes ) they coplayned .
41007003	For the pharises and all the Iewes excepte they washe their hondes ofte eate not observinge the tradicions of the elders .
41007004	And whe they come from the market except they washe they eate not . And many other thinges ther be which they have taken apon them to observe as the wasshinge of cuppes and cruses and of brasen vessels and of tables .
41007005	Then axed him the pharises and sribes why walke not thy disciples accordinge to ye tradicions of the elders but eate breede with vnweshen hondes ?
41007006	He answered and sayde vnto them : well prophesied Esaias of you ypocrites as it is writte : This people honoreth me with their lyppes but their hert is farre from me :
41007007	In vayne they worshippe me teachinge doctryns which are nothinge but ye comaundementes of men .
41007008	For ye laye the commaundement of God aparte and observe the tradicions of men as the wesshinge of cruses and of cuppes and many other suche lyke thinges ye do .
41007009	And he sayde vnto them : well ye cast asyde the comaundement of God to mayntayne youre owne tradicios .
41007010	For Moses sayde : Honoure thy father and thy mother : and whosoever cursseth father or mother let him dye for it .
41007011	But ye saye : a man shall saye to father or mother Corban : which is : that thou desyrest of me to helpe the with is geven God .
41007012	And so ye soffre him no more to do ought for his father or his mother
41007013	makinge the worde of God of none effecte through youre awne tradicions which ye have ordeyned . And many soche thinges ye do .
41007014	And he called all the people vnto him and sayde vnto them : Herken vnto me every one of you and vnderstonde .
41007015	There is no thinge with out a man that can defyle him when it entreth into him : but thoo thinges which procede out of him are those which defyle ye man .
41007016	If eny man have eares to heare let him heare
41007017	And whe he came to house awaye fro the people his disciples axed him of the similitude .
41007018	And he sayd vnto the : Are ye so without vnderstondinge ? Do ye not yet perceave yt whatsoever thinge from wt out entreth into a man it can not defyle him
41007019	because it entrith not in to his hert but into ye belly : and goeth out into the draught that porgeth oute all meates .
41007020	And he sayde : yt defileth a ma which cometh oute of a man .
41007021	For fro wt in even oute of the herte of men proceade evill thoughtes : advantry fornicacion murder
41007022	theeft coveteousnes wickednes diceyte vnclennes and a wicked eye blasphemy pryde folysshnes :
41007023	all these evyll thinges come from with in and defile a man .
41007024	And from thence he rose and went into ye borders of Tyre and Sidon and entred into an housse and wolde that no man shnld have knowen : But he coulde not be hyd .
41007025	For a certayne woma whose doughter had a foule sprete hearde of him and came and fell at his fete .
41007026	The woman was a Greke oute of Syrophenicia and she besought him yt he wolde caste out ye devyll oute of her doughter .
41007027	And Iesus sayde vnto her : let the chyldren fyrst be feed . For it is not mete to take the chyldres breed and to caste it vnto whelppes .
41007028	She answered and sayde vnto him : even soo master neverthelesse the whelppes also eate vnder the table of the chyldrens cromes .
41007029	And he sayde vnto her : for this sayinge goo thy waye the devyll is gone out of thy doughter .
41007030	And when she was come home to her housse she founde the devyll departed and her doughter lyinge on the beed .
41007031	And he departed agayne from the coostes of Tyre and Sidon and came vnto the see of Galile thorowe ye middes of the coostos of ye . x . cities .
41007032	And they brought vnto him one yt was deffe and stambred in his speche and prayde him to laye his honde apon him .
41007033	And he toke him asyde from ye people and put his fyngers in his eares and dyd spyt and touched his tounge
41007034	and loked vp to heven and sygthed and sayde vnto him : ephatha that is to saye be openned .
41007035	And streyght waye his eares were openned and the stringe of his tounge was loosed and he spake playne .
41007036	And he comaunded them that they shuld tell no man . But the more he forbad them soo moche the more a greate deale they publesshed it :
41007037	and were beyonde measure astonyed sayinge : He hath done all thinges well and hath made booth the deffe to heare and the dome to speake .
41008001	In those dayes whe ther was a very greate companye and had nothinge to eate Iesus called his disciples to him and sayd vnto the :
41008002	I have copassion on this people because they have nowe bene with me . iii . dayes and have nothinge to eate :
41008003	And yf I shuld sende the awaye fastinge to their awne houses they shulde faynt by the waye . For dyvers of the came from farre .
41008004	And his disciples answered him : where shuld a man have breade here in the wildernes to satisfie these ?
41008005	And he axed them : how many loves have ye ? They sayde : seven .
41008006	And he commaunded the people to syt doune on the grounde . And he toke the . vii . loves gave thankes brake and gave to his disciples to set before them . And they dyd set the before the people .
41008007	And they had a feawe smale fysshes . And he blessed them and comaunded them also to be set before them .
41008008	And they ate and were suffysed : And they toke vp yf the broken meate that was lefte . vii . baskettes full .
41008009	And they yt ate were in nomber aboute fowre thousand . And he sent them awaye .
41008010	And a none he entred into a ship wt his disciples and came into the parties of Dalmanutha .
41008011	And the pharises cam forth and begane to dispute with him sekinge of him a signe fro heven and temptinge him .
41008012	And he sygthed in his sprete and sayde : why doth this generacion seke a signe ? Verely I saye vnto you ther shall no signe be geven vnto this generacion .
41008013	And he lefte the and went into the ship agayne and departed over the water .
41008014	And they had forgotte to take breed wt the nether had they in the ship with them more then one loofe .
41008015	And he charged the sayinge . Take hede and beware of ye leven of ye pharises and of ye leve of Herode .
41008016	And they reasoned amonge the selves sayinge : we have no breed
41008017	And whe Iesus knewe yt he sayde vnto the : why take ye thought because ye have no bread ? perceave ye not yet nether vnderstonde ? Have ye youre hertes yet blynded ?
41008018	Have ye eyes and se not ? and have ye eares and heare not ? Do ye not remember ?
41008019	When I brake v . loves amonge . v . M . How many baskettes full of broke meate toke ye vp ? They sayde vnto him twelve .
41008020	When I brake . vii . amonge . iiii . M . How many basketes of the levinges of broken meate toke ye vp ? they sayde . vii .
41008021	And he sayde vnto the : how is it yt ye vnderstonde not ?
41008022	And he came to Bethsaida and they brought a blynde man vnto him and desyred him to touche him .
41008023	And he caught the blynde by the honde and leade him out of the toune and spat in his eyes and put his hondes apon him and axed him whether he saw ought .
41008024	And he loked vp and sayde : I se ye men : For I se the walke as they were trees .
41008025	After that he put his hondes agayne apon his eyes and made him see . And he was restored to his sight and sawe every ma clerly .
41008026	And he sent him home to his housse sayinge : nether goo into the toune nor tell it to eny in the toune .
41008027	And Iesus went out and his disciples into the tounes that longe to the cite called Cesarea Philippi . Aud by the waye he axed his disciples sayinge : whom do men saye yt I am ?
41008028	And they answered : some saye that thou arte Iohn Baptiste : some saye Helyas : and some one of the Prophetes .
41008029	And he sayde vnto the : But whom saye ye that I am ? Peter answered and sayd vnto him : Thou arte very Christe .
41008030	And he charged them that they shuld tell no man of it .
41008031	And he beganne to teache them how that the sonne of man must suffre many thinges and shuld be reproved of the elders and of the hye prestes and scribes and be kylled and after thre dayes aryse agayne .
41008032	And he spake that sayinge openly . And Peter toke him asyde and began to chyde him .
41008033	Then he tourned aboute and looked on his disciples and rebuked Peter sayinge : Goo after me Satan . For thou saverest not ye thinges of God but the thinges of men .
41008034	And he called the people vnto him with his disciples also and sayd vnto them : Whosoever will folowe me let him forsake him sylfe and take vp his crosse and folowe me .
41008035	For whosoever will save his lyfe shall lose it But whosoever shall lose his lyfe for my sake and ye gospels ye same shall save it .
41008036	What shall it profet a ma yf he shuld wynne all ye worlde and loose his awne soule ?
41008037	or els what shall a ma geve to redeme his soule agayne ?
41008038	Whosoever therfore shall be asshamed of me and of my wordes amonge this advoutrous and sinfull generacion : of him shall the sonne of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father wt the holy angels .
41009001	And he sayde vnto them : Verely I saye vnto you : There be some of the that stonde here which shall not taste of deeth tyll they have sene the kyngdome of God come wt power .
41009002	And after . vi . dayes Iesus toke Peter Iames and Iohn and leede them vp into an hye mountayne out of ye waye alone and he was transfigured before them .
41009003	And his rayment dyd shyne and was made very whyte even as snowe : so whyte as noo fuller can make apon the erth .
41009004	And ther apered vnto them Helyas with Moses : and they talked with Iesu .
41009005	And Peter answered and sayde to Iesu : Master here is good beinge for vs let vs make . iii . tabernacles one for the one for Moses and one for Helyas .
41009006	And yet he wist not what he sayde : for they were afrayde .
41009007	And ther was a cloude that shaddowed the . And a voyce came out of the cloude sayinge : This is my dere sonne here him .
41009008	And sodenly they loked rounde aboute them and sawe no man more then Iesus only wt the .
41009009	And as they came doune from the hyll he charged the that they shuld tell no ma what they had sene tyll the sonne of man were rysen fro deeth agayne .
41009010	And they kepte that sayinge with them and demaunded one of a nother what yt rysinge from deeth agayne shuld meane ?
41009011	And they axed him sayinge : why then saye ye scribe that Helyas muste fyrste come ?
41009012	He answered and sayde vnto them : Helyas verelye shall fyrst come and restore all thinges . And also ye sonne of ma as it is wrytte shall suffre many thinges and shall be set at nought .
41009013	Moreouer I saye vnto you that Helyas is come and they have done vnto him whatsoever pleased them as it is wrytten of him .
41009014	And he came to his disciples and sawe moche people aboute them and the scribes disputinge with them .
41009015	And streyght waye all the people when they behelde him were amased and ran to him and saluted him .
41009016	And he sayde vnto the Scribes : what dispute ye with them ?
41009017	And one of the copanye answered and sayde : Master I have brought my sonne vnto the which hath a dome spirite .
41009018	And whensoever he taketh him he teareth him and he fometh and gnassheth with his tethe and pyneth awaye . And I spake to thy disciples that they shuld caste him out and they coulde not .
41009019	He answered him and sayd : O generacion wt out faith how longe shall I be with you ? How longe shall I suffre you ? Bringe him vnto me .
41009020	And they brought him vnto him . And assone as ye sprete sawe him he tare him . And he fell doune on the grounde walowinge and fomynge .
41009021	And he axed his father : how longe is it a goo sens this hath happened him ? And he sayde of a chylde :
41009022	and ofte tymes casteth him into the fyre and also into the water to destroye him . But yf thou canste do eny thinge have mercy on vs and helpe vs .
41009023	And Iesus sayde vnto him : ye yf thou couldest beleve all thinges are possible to him yt belevith .
41009024	And streygth waye the father of the chylde cryed with teares sayinge : Lorde I beleve helpe myne vnbelefe .
41009025	When Iesus sawe that the people came runnynge togedder vnto him he rebuked the foule sprete sayinge vnto him : Thou domme and deffe sprete I charge the come out of him and entre no more into him .
41009026	And the sprete cryed and rent him sore and came out : And he was as one that had bene deed in so moche yt many sayde he is deed .
41009027	But Iesus caught his honde and lyfte him vp : and he roose .
41009028	And when he was come into the housse his disciples axed him secretly : why coulde not we caste him out ?
41009029	And he sayde vnto them : this kynde can by no nother meanes come forth but by prayer and fastynge .
41009030	And they departed thens and toke their iorney thorow Galile and he wolde not that eny man shuld have knowen it .
41009031	For he taught his disciples and sayde vnto them : The sonne of man shalbe delyvered into ye hondes of men and they shall kyll him and after that he is kylled he shall aryse agayne the thryd daye .
41009032	But they wiste not what that sayinge meat and were affrayed to axe him .
41009033	And he came to Capernaum . And when he was come to housse he axed the : what was it that ye disputed bytwene you by the waye ?
41009034	And they helde their peace : for by the waye they reasoned amonge the selves who shuld be the chefest .
41009035	And he sate doune and called the twelve vnto him and sayd to them : yf eny man desyre to be fyrst the same shalbe last of all and servaunt vnto all .
41009036	And he toke a chylde and set him in ye middes of them and toke him in his armes and sayde vnto them .
41009037	Whosoever receave eny soche a chylde in my name receaveth me . And whosoever receaveth me receaveth not me but him that sent me .
41009038	Iohn answered him sayinge : Master we sawe one castynge out devyls in thy name which foloweth not vs and we forbade him because he foloweth vs not .
41009039	But Iesus sayde forbid him not . For ther is no ma that shall do a miracle in my name that can lightlyge speake evyll of me .
41009040	Whosoever is not agaynste you is on youre parte .
41009041	And whosoever shall geve you a cuppe of water to drinke for my names sake because ye belonge to Christe verely I saye vnto you he shall not loose his rewarde .
41009042	And whosoever shall offende one of these lytelons yt beleve in me it were better for him yt a mylstone were hanged aboute his necke and yt he he were cast into ye see :
41009043	wherfore yf thy hande offende ye cut him of . It is better for ye to entre into lyffe maymed then havynge two hondes goo into hell into fire yt never shalbe quenched
41009044	where there worme dyeth not and the fyre never goeth oute .
41009045	Lykewyse yf thy fote offende the cut him of . For it is better for the to goo halt into lyfe then havynge two fete to be cast into hell into fyre that never shalbe quenched :
41009046	where there worme dyeth not and the fyre never goeth oute .
41009047	Even so yf thyne eye offende the plucke him oute . It is better for the to goo into the kyngdom of god with one eye then havynge two eyes to be caste into hell fyre :
41009048	where there worme dyeth not and the fyre never goeth oute .
41009049	Every man therfore shalbe salted wt fyre : And every sacrifise shalbe seasoned with salt .
41009050	Salt is good . But yf ye salt be vnsavery : what shall ye salte therwith ? Se yt ye have salt in youre selves : and have peace amonge youre selves one with another .
41010001	And he rose from thence and went into ye coostes of Iurie through the region yt is beyonde Iordan . And ye people resorted vnto him afresshe : and as he was wont he taught them agayne .
41010002	And the pharises came and axed him a question : whether it were laufull for a ma to put awaye his wyfe : to prove him .
41010003	And he answered and sayd vnto the : what dyd Moses byd you do ?
41010004	And they sayde : Moses suffred to wryte a testimoniall of devorsement and to put hyr awaye .
41010005	And Iesus answered and sayd vnto the : For ye hardnes of youre hertes he wrote this precept vnto you .
41010006	But at the fyrste creacion God made the man and woman .
41010007	And for this thinges sake shall ma leve his father and mother and bide by his wyfe
41010008	and they twayne shalbe one flesshe . So then are they now not twayne but one flesshe .
41010009	Therfore what God hath cuppled let not ma separat .
41010010	And in the housse his disciples axed him agayne of yt matter .
41010011	And he sayde vnto them : Whosoever putteth awaye his wyfe and maryeth another breaketh wedlocke to her warde .
41010012	And yf a woman forsake her husband and be maryed to another she comitteth advoutrie .
41010013	And they brought chyldren to him that he should touche the . And his disciples rebuked thoose that brought the .
41010014	When Iesus sawe that he was displeased and sayd to the : Suffre the chyldre to come vnto me and forbid the not . For of suche is ye kyngdome of God .
41010015	Verely I saye vnto you whosoever shall not receave ye kyngdome of God as a chylde he shall not entre therin .
41010016	And he toke the vp in his armes and put his hondes vpon them and blessed the .
41010017	And when he was come in to the waye ther came one runninge and kneled to him and axed him : good master what shall I do that I maye enheret eternall lyfe ?
41010018	Iesus sayde to him : why callest thou me good ? There is no ma good but one which is God .
41010019	Thou knowest the comaundementes : breake not matrimony : kyll not : steale not : bere not falce wytnes : defraude no man : honoure thy father and mother .
41010020	He answered and sayde to him : master all these I have observed fro my youth .
41010021	Iesus behelde him and had a favour to him and sayde vnto him : one thynge is lackinge vnto the . Goo and sell all that thou hast and geve to the povre and thou shalt have treasure in heven and come and folowe me and take vp thy crosse .
41010022	But he was discuforted with yt sayinge and wet awaye morninge for he had greate possessions .
41010023	And Iesus loked rounde aboute and sayde vnto his disciples : what an harde thinge is it for them that have riches to entre into the kyngdome of God .
41010024	And his disciples were astonneyd at his wordes . But Iesus answered agayne and sayde vnto them : chyldre how harde is it for them that trust in riches to entre in to the kyngdome of God .
41010025	It is easyer for a camell to go thorowe ye eye of an nedle then for a riche man to entre into the kyngdome of God .
41010026	And they were astonnyed out of measure sayinge betwene them selves : who then can be saved ?
41010027	Iesus loked vpon them and sayde : with men it is vnpossible but not with God : for with God all thynges are possible .
41010028	And Peter begane to saye vnto him : Lo we have forsaken all and have folowed the .
41010029	Iesus answered and sayde : Verely I saye vnto you ther is no man that forsaketh housse or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wyfe other chyldren or londes for my sake and the gospelles
41010030	which shall not receave an houndred foolde nowe in this lyfe : houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and chyldren and londes with persecucions : and in the worlde to come eternall lyfe .
41010031	Many that are fyrst shalbe last : and the last fyrst .
41010032	And they were in ye waye goinge vp to Ierusalem . And Iesus wet before them : and they were amased and as they folowed were affrayde . And Iesus toke ye . xii . agayne and begane to tell the what thinges shuld happe vnto him .
41010033	Beholde we goo vp to Ierusalem and the sonne of man shalbe delyvered vnto the hye preestes and vnto the Scribes : and they shall condempne him to deeth and shall delyvre him to the gentyls :
41010034	and they shall mocke hym and scourge him and spit vpo hym and kyll him . And the thirde daye he shall ryse agayne .
41010035	And then Iames and Iohn ye sonnes of zebede came vnto him sayinge : master we wolde that thou shuldest do for vs what soever we desyre .
41010036	He sayde vnto them : what wolde ye I shuld do vnto you ?
41010037	They sayd to him : graut vnto vs that we maye sitte one on thy right honde and the other on thy lyfte honde in thy glory .
41010038	But Iesus sayd vnto the : Ye wot not what ye axe . Can ye dryncke of the cup that I shall dryncke of and be baptised in ye baptime that I shalbe baptised in ?
41010039	And they sayde vnto him : that we can . Iesus sayde vnto them : ye shall dryncke of the cup that I shall dryncke of and be baptised with the baptyme that I shalbe baptised in :
41010040	but to sit on my right honde and on my lyfte honde ys not myne to geve but to them for whom it is prepared .
41010041	And when the . x . hearde that they bega to disdayne at Iames and Iohn .
41010042	But Iesus called the vnto him and sayde to them : ye knowe that they which seme to beare rule amonge the gentyls raygne as lordes over the . And they that be greate amoge them exercyse auctorite over them .
41010043	So shall it not be amonge you but whosoever of you wilbe greate amoge you shalbe youre minister .
41010044	And whosoever wilbe chefe shalbe servaunt vnto all .
41010045	For eve the sonne of man came not to be ministred vnto : but to minister and to geve his lyfe for the redempcion of many .
41010046	And they came to Hierico . And as he went oute of Hierico with his disciples and a greate nobre of people : Barthimeus ye sonne of Thimeus which was blinde sate by ye hye wayes syde begginge .
41010047	And when he hearde that it was Iesus of Nazareth he began to crye and to saye : Iesus the sonne of David have mercy on me .
41010048	And many rebuked him yt he shuld holde is peace . But he cryed the moore a greate deale thou sonne of David have mercy on me .
41010049	And Iesus stode still and commaunded hym to be called . And they called the blinde sayinge vnto him : Be of good conforte : ryse he calleth the .
41010050	And he threwe awaye his clooke and roose and came to Iesus .
41010051	And Iesus answered and sayde vnto hym : what wilt thou that I do vnto the ? The blynde sayde vnto hym : master that I myght see .
41010052	Iesus sayde vnto him : goo thy waye thy faith hath saved the . And by and by he receaved his sight and folowed Iesus in the waye .
41011001	And when they came nye to Hierusalem vnto Bethphage and Bethanie besydes mout olivete he sent forth two of his hisciples
41011002	and sayde vnto the : Goo youre wayes into the toune that is over agaynst you . And assone as ye be entred into it ye shall fynde a coolte bounde wheron never man sate : loose him and bringe him .
41011003	And if eny man saye vnto you : why do ye soo ? Saye that the Lorde hath neade of him : and streight waye he will sende him hidder .
41011004	And they wet their waye and foud a coolte tyed by the dore with out in a place where two wayes met and they losed him .
41011005	And divers of the that stode there sayde vnto the : what do ye loosinge ye coolte ?
41011006	And they sayd vnto them eve as Iesus had comaunded the . And they let them goo .
41011007	And they brought ye coolte to Iesus and caste their garmetes on him : and he sate vpo him .
41011008	And many sprede there garmetes in the waye . Other cut doune brauches of the trees and strawed them in ye waye .
41011009	And they yt went before and they that folowed cryed sayinge : Hos anna : blessed be he that cometh in ye name of ye Lorde .
41011010	Blessed be ye kingdome that cometh in ye name of him yt is Lorde of oure father David . Hos anna in ye hyest .
41011011	And ye Lorde entred in to Ierusalem and into the teple . And when he had loked roudabout vpon all thinges and now ye eve tyde was come he went out vnto Bethany with ye twelve .
41011012	And on the morowe when they were come out fro Bethany he hungred
41011013	and spyed a fygge tree a farre of havinge leves and wet to se whether he myght finde eny thinge ther on . But when he came therto he foude no thinge but leves : for the tyme of fygges was not yet .
41011014	And Iesus answered and sayde to it : never man eate frute of the here after whill ye worlde stondith . And his disciples hearde it .
41011015	And they came to Ierusalem . And Iesus wet into the teple and begane to cast out ye sellers and byers in the teple and overthrewe the tables of the money chaungers and the stoles of them that solde doves :
41011016	and wolde not suffre that eny man caried a vessell thorow the temple .
41011017	And he taught sayinge vnto them is it not written : my housse shalbe called the housse of prayer vnto all nacions ? But ye have made it a deen of theves .
41011018	And the Scribes and hye prestes hearde yt and sought howe to distroye him . For they feared him because all the people marveled at his doctrine .
41011019	And when eve was come he went out of the cite .
41011020	And in the mornynge as they passed by they sawe the fygge tree dryed vp by ye rotes .
41011021	And Peter remembred and sayde vnto him : master beholde the fygge tree which thou cursedest is widdred awaye .
41011022	And Iesus answered and sayde vnto them : Have confides in God .
41011023	Verely I saye vnto you that whosoever shall saye vnto this mountayne : take awaye thy silfe and cast thy silfe in to the see and shall not waver in his herte but shall beleve yt those thinges which he sayeth shall come to passe what soever he sayeth shalbe done to him .
41011024	Therfore I saye vnto you what soever ye desyre when ye praye beleve yt ye shall have it and it shalbe done vnto you .
41011025	And when ye stod and praye forgeve yf ye have eny thinge agaynste eny man yt youre father also which is in heve maye forgeve you youre trespases .
41011027	And they came agayne to Hierusalem . And as he walked in the teple ther came to him ye hye prestes and the Scribes and the elders
41011028	and sayd vnto him : by what auctorite doest thou these thinges ? and who gave the this auctorite to do these thinges ?
41011029	Iesus answered and sayde vnto them : I will also axe of you a certayne thinge : and answere ye me and I wyll tell you by what auctorite I do these thinges .
41011030	The baptyme of Iohn was it from heven or of men ? Answer me .
41011031	And they thought in them selves sayinge : yf we shall saye from heven : he will saye why then dyd ye not beleve him ?
41011032	but if we shall saye of me : then feare we ye people . For all men counted Iohn that he was a verie Prophete .
41011033	And they answered and sayd vnto Iesu : we cannot tell . And Iesus answered and sayd vnto them : nether wyll I tell you by what auctorite I do these thynges .
41012001	And he beganne to speake vnto them in similitudes . A certayne man planted a vineyarde and copased it with an hedge and ordeyned a wyne presse and bylt a toure in yt . And let yt out to hyre vnto husbandme and went into a straunge countre .
41012002	And when the tyme was come he sent to the tennauntes a servaunt that he myght receave of the tenauntes of the frute of the vyneyarde .
41012003	And they caught him and bet him and sent him agayne emptye .
41012004	And moreoever he sent vnto them another servaunt and at him they cast stones and brake his heed and sent him agayne all to revyled .
41012005	And agayne he sent another and him they kylled : and many other beetynge some and kyllinge some .
41012006	Yet had he one sonne whom he loved tenderly him also he sent at the last vnto them sayinge : they wyll feare my sonne .
41012007	But the tenauntes sayde amongest them selves : this is the heyre : come let vs kyll hym and ye inheritauce shalbe oures .
41012008	And they toke him and kyllid him and cast him out of the vyneyarde .
41012009	What shall then the lorde of the vyneyarde do ? He will come and destroye ye tenauntes and let out the vyneyarde to other .
41012010	Have ye not redde this scripture ? The stoone which ye bylders dyd refuse is made ye chefe stoone in ye corner :
41012011	this was done of ye Lorde and is mervelous in oure eyes .
41012012	And they went about to take him but they feared the people . For they perceaved that he spake that similitude agaynst them . And they left him and went their waye .
41012013	And they sent vnto him certayne of ye Pharises with Herodes servantes to take him in his wordes .
41012014	And assone as they were come they sayd vnto him : master we knowe yt thou arte true and carest for no man : for thou consyderest not the degre of men but teachest the waye of God truly : Ys it laufull to paye tribute to Cesar or not ?
41012015	Ought we to geve or ought we not to geve ? He vnderstode their simulacion and sayde vnto them : Why tepte ye me ? Brynge me a peny that I maye se yt .
41012016	And they brought . And he sayde vnto them : Whose ys thys ymage and superscripcion ? And they sayde vnto him Cesars .
41012017	And Iesus answered and saide vnto the : Then geve to Cesar that which belongeth to Cesar : and to God that which perteyneth to God . And they mervelled at him .
41012018	Then came the Saduces vnto him which saye ther is no resurreccion . And they axed hym sayinge :
41012019	Master Moses wroote vnto vs yf eny mans brother dye and leve his wyfe behinde him and leve no chyldren : that then hys brother shuld take his wyfe and reyse vp seed vnto his brother .
41012020	Ther were seven brethren : and the fyrst toke a wyfe and when he dyed leeft no seed behynde him .
41012021	And the seconde toke hir and dyed : nether leeft eny seed . And the thyrde lyke wyse .
41012022	And seve had her and leeft no seed behynde them . Last of all the wyfe dyed also .
41012023	In the resurreccio then when they shall ryse agayne : whose wyfe shall she be of them ? For seven had her to wyfe .
41012024	Iesus answered and sayde vnto them : Are ye not therfore deceaved and vnderstonde not the scryptures nether the power of God ?
41012025	For when they shall ryse agayne fro deeth they nether mary nor are maryed : but are as the angels which are in heven .
41012026	As touchynge the deed that they shall ryse agayne : have ye not redde in the boke of Moses howe in the busshe God spake vnto him sayinge : I am the God of Abraham and God of Ysaac and the God of Iacob ?
41012027	He is not the God of the deed but the God of the livynge . Ye are therfore greatly deceaved .
41012028	And ther came one of the scribes that had hearde them disputynge to gedder and perceaved that he had answered them well and axed him : Which is the fyrste of all the commaundemetes ?
41012029	Iesus answered him : the fyrste of all the comaundementes is . Heare Israel : The Lorde God is one Lorde .
41012030	And thou shalt love the Lorde thy God with all thy hert and with all thy soule and with all thy mynde and with all thy strength . This is the fyrste commaundement .
41012031	And the seconde is lyke vnto this : Thou shalt love thy neghbour as thy silfe . Ther is none other commaundement greater then these .
41012032	And the Scribe sayde vnto him : well master thou hast sayd ye truthe that ther ys one God and that ther is none but he .
41012033	And to love him with all the herte and with all the mynde and with all the soule and with all the stregth : and to love a mans neghbour as him silfe ys a greater thinge then all burntofferings and sacrifices .
41012034	And when Iesus sawe that he answered discretly he sayde vnto him : Thou arte not farre from the kyngdome of God . And no man after that durst axe him eny questio .
41012035	And Iesus answered and sayde teachynge in the temple : how saye the Scribes yt Christ is the sonne of David ?
41012036	for David him selfe inspyred with the holy goost sayde : The Lorde sayde to my Lorde syt on my right honde tyll I make thyne enemyes thy fote stole .
41012037	Then David hym silfe calleth him Lorde : and by what meanes is he then his sonne ? And moche people hearde him gladly .
41012038	And he sayde vnto them in his doctrine : beware of the Scribes which love to goo in longe clothinge : and love salutacions in ye market places
41012039	and the chefe seates in the synagoges and to syt in the vppermost roumes at feastes
41012040	and devoure widowes houses and that vnder coloure of longe prayinge . These shall receave greater dampnacion .
41012041	And Iesus sat over agaynst the treasury and behelde how the people put money in to the treasury . And many that were ryche cast in moch .
41012042	And ther cam a certayne povre widowe and she threwe in two mytes which make a farthynge .
41012043	And he called vnto him his disciples and sayde vnto them : Verely I saye vnto you that this pover widowe hath cast moare in then all they which have caste into the treasury .
41012044	For they all dyd cast in of their superfluyte : but she of her poverte dyd cast in all that she had eve all her livynge .
41013001	And as he went out of the teple one of his disciples sayde vnto him : Master se what stones and what byldynges are here .
41013002	And Iesus answered and sayde vnto him : Seist thou these greate byldinges ? There shall not be leefte one stone vpon a another that shall not be throwen doune .
41013003	And as he sate on moute olivete over agest the teple Peter and Iames and Iohn and Andrew axed him secretly :
41013004	tell vs when shall these thinges be ? And what is ye signe whe all these thinges shalbe fulfilled ?
41013005	And Iesus answered the and bega to saye : take hede lest eny man deceave you .
41013006	For many shall come in my name sayinge : I am Christ and shall deceave many .
41013007	When ye shall heare of warre and tydinges of warre be ye not troubled . For soche thinges muste nedes be . But the ende is not yet .
41013008	For ther shall nacion aryse agaynste nacion and kyngdome agaynst kyngdome . And ther shalbe erth quakes in all quarters and famyshment and troubles . These are the begynnynge of sorowes .
41013009	But take ye hede to youre selves . For they shall bringe you vp to ye counsels and into ye synagoges and ye shalbe beaten : ye and shalbe brought before rulers and kynges for my sake for a testimoniall vnto them .
41013010	And the gospell must fyrste be publysshed amoge all nacions .
41013011	But when they leade you and present you toke noo thought afore honde what ye shall saye nether ymagion : but whatsoever is geve you at the same tyme that speake . For it shall not be ye that shall speake but ye holy goost .
41013012	Ye and the brother shall delyvre the brother to deeth and the father the sonne and the chyldre shall ryse agaynste their fathers and mothers and shall put them to deeth .
41013013	And ye shalbe hated of all men for my names sake . But whosoever shall endure vnto the ende the same shalbe safe .
41013014	Moreover whe ye se the abhominacio that betokeneth desolacion wherof is spoken by Daniel the Prophet stonde where it ought not let him that redeth vnderstonde . Then let them that be in Iurie fle to the mountaynes .
41013015	And let him that is on the housse toppe not descende doune into the housse nether entre therin to fetche eny thinge oute of his housse .
41013016	And let hym that is in the felde not tourne backe agayne vnto the thinges which he leeft behynde him for to take his cloothes with him .
41013017	Woo is then to them that are wt chylde and to them that geve soucke in thoose dayes .
41013018	But praye that youre flyght be not in the wynter .
41013019	For ther shalbe in those dayes suche tribulacion as was not from the begynninge of creatures which God created vnto this tyme nether shalbe .
41013020	And excepte yt the Lorde shuld shorten those dayes no ma shuld be saved . But for the electes sake which he hath chosen he hath shortened those dayes .
41013021	And then yf eny man saye to you : loo here is Christ : loo he is there beleve not .
41013022	For falce Christes shall aryse and falce Prophetes and shall shewe myracles and wondres to deceave yf it were possible evyn the electe .
41013023	But take ye hede : beholde I have shewed you all thinges before .
41013024	Moreover in thoose dayes after that tribulacio the sunne shall wexe darke and the mone shall not geve her light
41013025	and the starres of heven shall fall : and the powers wich are in heven shall move .
41013026	And then shall they se the sonne of man comynge in the cloudes with greate power and glory .
41013027	And then shall he sende his angels and shall gaddre to gedder his electe from the fower wyndes and from the one ende of the worlde to the other .
41013028	Learne a similitude of ye fygge tree . When his braunches are yet tender and hath brought forthe leves ye knowe that sommer is neare .
41013029	So in lyke maner when ye se these thinges come to passe : vnderstond that it ys nye even at the dores .
41013030	Verely I saye vnto you yt this generacion shall not passe tyll all these thinges be done .
41013031	Heven and erth shall passe but my wordes shall not passe .
41013032	But of the daye and the houre knoweth no ma : no not the angels which are in heven : nether the sonne him silfe save the father only .
41013033	Take hede watche and praye for ye knowe not when the tyme ys .
41013034	As a man which is gone in to a straunge countrey and hath lefte hys housse and geven auctorite to his servautes and to every man hys worke and commaunded the porter to watche .
41013035	Watche therfore for ye knowe not when the master of ye housse will come whether at eve or at mydnyght whether at the cocke crowynge or in the daunynge :
41013036	lest yf he come sodenly he shuld fynde you slepynge .
41013037	And that I saye vnto you I saye vnto all men watche .
41014001	After two dayes folowed ester and the dayes of swete breed . And the hye prestes and the Scrybes sought meanes how they myght take hym by crafte and put him to deeth .
41014002	But they sayde : not in the feast daye leest eny busynes aryse amonge the people .
41014003	When he was in Bethania in the housse of Simon the leper even as he sate at meate ther came a woma hauynge an alablaster boxe of oyntment called narde that was pure and costly : and she brake the boxe and powred it on is heed .
41014004	And ther were some that were not content in them selves and sayde : what neded this waste of oyntment ?
41014005	For it myght have bene soolde for more then thre hundred pens and bene geve vnto the poore . And they grudged agaynste hir .
41014006	And Iesus sayde : let hir be in reest why trouble ye hir ? She hath done a good worke on me .
41014007	For ye shall have poore with you all wayes : and when soever ye will ye maye do them good : but me ye shall not have alwayes .
41014008	She hath done that she coulde : she came a fore honde to anoynt my boddy to his buryinge warde .
41014009	Verely I saye vnto you : wheresoever this gospell shalbe preached thorowout the whole worlde : thys also that she hath done shalbe rehearsed in remembraunce of her .
41014010	And Iudas Iscarioth one of the twelve went awaye vnto the hye prestes to betraye hym vnto them .
41014011	When they herde that they were gladde and promised yt they wolde geve him money . And he sought howe he myght conveniently betraye him .
41014012	And the fyrste daye of swete breed when men offer ye pascall lambe his disciples sayd vnto him : where wilt thou that we goo and prepare that thou mayst eate the ester lambe ?
41014013	And he sent forth two of his disciples and sayde vnto them : Goo ye into the cyte and ther shall a man mete you beringe a pitcher of water folowe him .
41014014	And whither soever he goeth in saye ye to ye good man of ye housse : the master axeth where is the geest chambre where I shall eate ye ester lambe with my disciples .
41014015	And he will shewe you a greate parlour paved and prepared : there make ready for vs .
41014016	And his disciples went forth and came to the cyte and founde as he had sayd vnto them : and made ready the ester lambe .
41014017	And at even he came with the . xii .
41014018	And as they sate at borde and ate Iesus sayde : Verely I saye vnto you : that one of you shall betraye me which eateth with me .
41014019	And they begane to morne and to saye to him one by one : ys it I ? And a nother sayde : ys it I ?
41014020	He answered and sayde vnto them : It ys one of the . xii . and the same deppeth with me in the platter .
41014021	The sonne of man goeth as it ys written of him : but woo be to that man by whome the sonne of man is betrayed . Good were it for him if that man had never bene borne .
41014022	And as they ate Iesus toke breede blessed and brake and gave to them and sayde : Take eate this ys my body .
41014023	And he toke the cup gave thankes and gave it to them and they all dranke of it .
41014024	And he sayde vnto them : This is my bloude of the new testament which is sheed for many .
41014025	Verely I saye vnto you : I will drinke no moore of this frute of the vyne vntyll that daye that I drinke it new in the kyngdome of God .
41014026	And when they had sayd grace they went out to mount Olyvete .
41014027	And Iesus sayde vnto them : All ye shalbe offended thorow me this nyght . For it is wrytte : I will smyte ye shepeherd and the shepe shalbe scattered .
41014028	But after that I am rysen agayne I will goo into Galile before you .
41014029	Peter sayde vnto him : And though all men shuld be offended yet wolde not I .
41014030	And Iesus sayd vnto him : Verely I saye vnto ye this daye even in this nyght before ye cocke crowe twyse thou shalt denye me thryse .
41014031	And he spake boldlyer : no yf I shulde dye wt the I will not deny the . Lyke wyse also sayd they all .
41014032	And they came into a place named Gethsemani . And he sayde to his disciples : Syt ye here whyll I goo aparte and praye .
41014033	And he toke with him Peter Iames and Iohn and he began to waxe abasshed and to be in an agonye
41014034	and sayde vnto the : My soule is very hevy even vnto the deeth tary here and watche .
41014035	And he went forth a lytle and fell doune on ye grounde and prayed : that yf it were possible the houre myght passe from him .
41014036	And he sayd : Abba father all thinges are possible vnto the take awaye this cup from me . Neverthelesse not that I will but that thou wilt be done .
41014037	And he cam and founde the slepinge and sayd to Peter : Simon slepest thou ? Couldest not thou watche with me one houre ?
41014038	watche ye and praye leest ye entre into temptacion : ye sprete is redy but ye flessh is weeke .
41014039	And agayne he went awaye and prayde and spake ye same wordes .
41014040	And he returned and founde them a slepe agayne for their eyes were hevy : nether wist they what to answere him .
41014041	And he cam the thyrde tyme and sayd vnto the : slepe hens forth and take youre ease it is ynough . The houre is come beholde ye sonne of man shalbe delyvered into ye hondes of synners .
41014042	Ryse vp let vs goo . Loo he that betrayeth me is at hande .
41014043	And immediatly whyll he yet spake came Iudas one of the twelve and with him a greate nomber of people with sweardes and staves from the hye prestes and scribes and elders .
41014044	And he that betrayed him had geven them a generall toke sayinge : whosoever I do kisse he it is : take him and leade him awaye warely .
41014045	And assone as he was come he went streyght waye to him and sayd vnto him : master master and kissed him .
41014046	And they layde their hondes on him and toke him .
41014047	And one of them that stode by drue out a swearde and smote a servaunt of the hye preste and cut of his eare .
41014048	And Iesus answered and sayd vnto the : ye be come out as vnto a thefe wt sweardes and with staves for to take me .
41014049	I was dayly with you in ye temple teachinge and ye toke me not : but yt the scriptures shuld be fulfilled .
41014050	And they all forsoke him and ranne awaye .
41014051	And ther folowed him a certeyne yonge man cloothed in lynnen apon ye bare and the yongemen caught him
41014052	and he lefte his lynnen and fleed from them naked .
41014053	And they leed Iesus awaye to ye hyest preste of all and to him came all the hye prestes and the elders and the scribes .
41014054	And Peter folowed him a greate waye of even into the pallys of the hye preste and sat with the servauntes and warmed him sylfe at the fyre .
41014055	And the hye prestes and all ye counsell sought for witnes agaynste Iesu to put him to death and founde noone .
41014056	Yet many bare falce witnes agaynste him but their witnes aggreed not to geder .
41014057	And ther aroose certayne and brought falce witnes agaynste him sayinge .
41014058	We herde him saye : I will destroye this temple made with hondes and with in thre dayes I will bylde another made with out hondes .
41014059	But their witnes agreed not to geder .
41014060	And the hyeste preste stode up amongest them and axed Iesus sayinge : answerest thou nothinge ? How is it that these beare witnes agaynst the ?
41014061	And he helde his peace and answered noothinge . Agayne the hyeste Preste axed him and sayde vnto him : Arte thou Christ the sonne of the blessed ?
41014062	And Iesus sayde : I am . And ye shall se the sonne of man syt on the ryght honde of power and come in the cloudes of heven .
41014063	Then the hyest preste rent his cloothes and sayd : what nede we eny further of witnes ?
41014064	Ye have herde the blasphemy what thinke ye ? And they all gave sentence yt he was worthy of deeth .
41014065	And some begane to spit at him and to cover his face and to bete him with fistes and to saye vnto him arede vnto vs . And the servauntes boffeted him on the face .
41014066	And as Peter was beneeth in ye pallys ther came one of ye weches of ye hyest preste :
41014067	and whe she saw Petre warmynge him sylfe she loked on him and sayd : wast not thou also wt Iesus of Nazareth ?
41014068	And he denyed it sayinge : I knowe him not nether wot I what thou sayest . And he went out into ye poorche and the cocke crewe .
41014069	And a damsell sawe him and agayne beganne to saye to the that stode by this is one of the .
41014070	And he denyed it agayne . And anone after they that stode by sayde agayne to Peter : suerly thou arte one of the for thou arte of Galile and thy speache agreth therto .
41014071	And he beganne to cursse and to sweare sayinge : I knowe not this man of whom ye speake .
41014072	And agayne the cocke krewe and Peter remembred the worde that Iesus sayd vnto him : before the cocke crowe twyse thou shalt deny me thryse and beganne to wepe .
41015001	And anone in ye dawnynge the hye prestes helde counsell wt ye elders and ye scribes and ye whoole cogregacion and bounde Iesus and ledde him awaye and delivered him to Pilate .
41015002	And Pilate axed him : arte thou the kynge of the Iewes ? And he answered and sayde vnto him : thou sayest it .
41015003	And the hye prestes accused him of many thinges .
41015004	Wherfore Pilate axed him agayne sayinge : Answerest thou nothinge ? Beholde how many thinges they lay vnto thy charge .
41015005	Iesus yet answered never aworde so that Pilate merveled .
41015006	At that feast Pilate was wont to delivre at their pleasure a presoner : whomsoever they wolde desyre .
41015007	And ther was one named Barrabas which laye bounde with the that made insurreccion and in the insurreccion comitted murther .
41015008	And ye people called vnto him and began to desyre accordinge as he had ever done vnto them .
41015009	Pylate answered them and sayd : Will ye that I lowse vnto you the kynge of the Iewes ?
41015010	For he knewe that the hye Prestes had delyvered him of envy .
41015011	But the hye prestes had moved the people that he shuld rather delyvre Barrabas vnto them .
41015012	And Pylate answered agayne and sayd vnto the : What will ye then that I do wt him whom ye call ye kynge of ye Iewes ?
41015013	And they cryed agayne : crucifie him .
41015014	Pylate sayde vnto them : What evell hath he done ? And they cryed ye moore fervently : crucifie him .
41015015	And so Pylate willinge to content the people lowsed them Barrabas and delyvered Iesus when he had scourged him for to be crucified .
41015016	And the souddeers ledde him awaye into ye commen hall and called togedder the whoole multitude
41015017	and they clothed him with purple and they platted a croune of thornes and crouned him with all
41015018	and beganne to salute him . Hayle kynge of the Iewes .
41015019	And they smoote him on the heed wt a rede and spat apon him and kneled doune and worsheped him .
41015020	And when they had moocked him they toke the purple of him and put his awne cloothes on him and ledde him oute to crucifie him .
41015021	And they compelled one that passed by called Symon of Cyrene ( which cam oute of the felde and was father of Alexander and Rufus ) to beare his crosse .
41015022	And they brought him to a place named Golgotha ( which is by interpretacion the place of deed mens scoulles )
41015023	and they gave him to drinke wyne myngled with myrte but he receaved it not .
41015024	And when they had crucified him they parted his garmentes castinge loottes for them what every man shulde have .
41015025	And it was aboute ye thyrde houre and they crucified him .
41015026	And the tytle of his cause was wrytten : The kynge of the Iewes .
41015027	And they crucified with him two theves : the one on the ryght honde and the other on his lyfte .
41015028	And the scripture was fulfilled which sayeth : he was counted amonge the wicked .
41015029	And they that went by rayled on him : waggynge their heedes and sayinge : A wretche that destroyest the temple and byldest it in thre dayes :
41015030	save thy sylfe and come doune from the crosse .
41015031	Lyke wyse also mocked him ye hye preestes amonge them selves with the scribes and sayde : He saved other men him sylfe he cannot save .
41015032	Let Christ the kynge of Israel now descende from the crosse that we maye se and beleve . And they that were crucified with him checked him also .
41015033	And when the sixte houre was come darknes aroose over all the erth vntyll ye nynthe houre .
41015034	And at the nynthe houre Iesus cryed with a loude voyce sayinge : Eloi Eloi lamaasbathani which is yf it be interpreted : my God my God why hast thou forsaken me ?
41015035	And some of them that stode by when they hearde yt sayde : beholde he calleth for Helyas
41015036	And one ran and filled a sponge full of veneger and put it on a rede and gave him to drinke sayinge : let him alone let vs se whether Helyas will come and take him doune .
41015037	But Iesus cryed with aloude voyce and gave vp the gooste .
41015038	And the vayle of the temple dyd rent in two peces from the toppe to the boottome .
41015039	And when the Centurion which stode before him sawe that he so cryed and gave vp the gooste he sayd : truly this man was the sonne of God .
41015040	Ther were also wemen a good waye of beholdinge him : amonge whom was Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of Iames the lytle and of Ioses and Mary Salome
41015041	which also when he was in Galile folowed him and ministred vnto him and many other wemen which came vp with him to Hierusalem .
41015042	And now when nyght was come ( because it was ye even that goeth before ye saboth )
41015043	Ioseph of Arimathia a noble councelour which also loked for ye kyngdome of God came and went in booldly vnto Pylate and begged ye boddy of Iesu .
41015044	And Pylate merveled that he was alredy deed and called vnto him ye Centurion and axed of him whether he had bene eny whyle deed .
41015045	And when he knewe the trueth of the Centurion he gave ye body to Ioseph .
41015046	And he bought a lynnen cloothe and toke him doune and wrapped him in ye lynnen cloothe and layde him in a tombe yt was hewen oute of ye rocke and rolled a stone vnto the doze of the sepulcre .
41015047	And Mary Magdalen and Mary Ioses beheld where he was layde .
41016001	And when ye saboth daye was past Mary Magdalen and Mary Iacobi and Salome bought odures that they myght come and anoynt him .
41016002	And erly in the morninge the nexte daye after the saboth day they came vnto the sepulcre when the sunne was rysen .
41016003	And they sayd one to another : who shall rolle vs awaye the stone from the dore of the sepulcre ?
41016004	And when they looked they sawe how the stone was rolled awaye : for it was a very greate one .
41016005	And they went into the sepulcre and sawe a yonge man syttinge on the ryght syde cloothed in a longe whyte garmet and they were abasshed .
41016006	And he sayd vnto the be not afrayed : ye seke Iesus of Nazareth which was crucified . He is rysen he is not here . Beholde the place where they put him .
41016007	But go youre waye and tell his disciples and namely Peter : he will goo before you into Galile : there shall ye se him as he sayde vnto you .
41016008	And they went oute quickly and fleed from the sepulcre . For they trembled and were amased . Nether sayd they eny thinge to eny man for they were afrayed .
41016009	When Iesus was rysen the morow after ye saboth daye he appered fyrst to Mary Magdalen oute of whom he cast seven devyls .
41016010	And she wet and toolde them that were with him as they morned and weapte .
41016011	And when they herde that he was alyve and he had appered to hyr they beleved it not .
41016012	After that he appered vnto two of them in a straunge figure as they walked and went into the country .
41016013	And they went and toolde it to the remnaunt . And they beleved them nether .
41016014	After that he appered vnto the eleve as they sate at meate : and cast in their tethe their vnbelefe and hardnes of herte : be cause they beleued not them which had sene him after his resurreccio .
41016015	And he sayd vnto them : Goo ye in to all the worlde and preache the glad tyges to all creatures
41016016	he that beleueth and is baptised shall be saved . But he that beleveth not shalbe dampned .
41016017	And these signes shall folowe them that beleve : In my name they shall cast oute devyls and shall speake with newe tonges
41016018	and shall kyll serpentes . And yf they drinke eny dedly thinge yt shall not hurte the . They shall laye their hondes on ye sicke and they shall recover .
41016019	So then when the lorde had spoken vnto them he was receaued into heauen and is set doune on the ryght honde of God .
41016020	And they went forth and preached every where . And the Lorde wrought with them and confirmed the worde with miracles that folowed .
42001001	For as moche as many have take in hand to compyle a treates of thoo thinges which are surely knowen amonge vs
42001002	even as they declared them vnto vs which from the beginnynge sawe them their selves and were ministers at the doyng :
42001003	I determined also assone as I had searched out diligently all thinges from the beginnynge that then I wolde wryte vnto the good Theophilus :
42001004	that thou myghtest knowe the certente of thoo thinges wher of thou arte informed .
42001005	There was in the dayes of Herode kynge of Iurie a certayne prest named Zacharias of ye course of Abia . And his wyfe was of ye doughters of Aaron : And her name was Elizabeth .
42001006	Booth were perfect before God and walked in all the lawes and ordinaces of the Lorde that no man coulde fynde fawte with them .
42001007	And they had no chylde because that Elizabeth was barre and booth were well stricken in age .
42001008	And it cam to passe as he executed the prestes office before god as his course came
42001009	( accordinge to the custome of the prestes office ) his lot was to bourne incece .
42001010	And wet into ye teple of ye Lorde and the whoale multitude of ye people were with out in prayer whill the incense was aburnynge .
42001011	And ther appered vnto him an angell of the lorde stondinge on the ryght syde of the altare of incense .
42001012	And when Zacharias sawe him he was abasshed and feare came on him .
42001013	And the angell sayde vnto him : feare not Zachary for thy prayer is hearde : And thy wyfe Elizabeth shall beare ye a sonne and thou shalt call his name Iohn
42001014	and thou shalt have ioye and gladnes and many shall reioyce at his birth .
42001015	For he shalbe greate in the sight of the lorde and shall nether drinke wyne ner stronge drinke . And he shalbe filled with the holy goost even in his mothers wombe :
42001016	and many of the chyldren of Israel shall he tourne to their Lorde God .
42001017	And he shall goo before him in the sprete and power of Helyas to tourne the hertes of the fathers to the chyldren and the vnbelevers to the wysdom of the iuste men : to make the people redy for the Lorde .
42001018	And Zacharias sayde vnto ye angell : Wher by shall I knowe this ? seinge that I am olde and my wyfe well stricken in yeares .
42001019	And the angell answered and sayde vnto him : I am Gabriell that stonde in the presens of God and am sent to speake vnto the : and to shewe the these glad tydinges .
42001020	And beholde thou shalt be domme and not able to speake vntyll the tyme that these thinges be performed because thou belevedst not my wordes which shalbe fulfilled in their season .
42001021	And the people wayted for Zacharias and mervelled that he taryed in the temple .
42001022	And whe he cam oute he could not speake vnto them . Wherby they perceaved that he had sene some vision in the temple . And he beckened vnto them and remayned speachlesse .
42001023	And it fortuned assone as ye tyme of his office was oute he departed home into his awne housse .
42001024	And after thoose dayes his wyfe Elizabeth coceaved and hyd her sylfe . v . monethes sayinge :
42001025	This wyse hath God dealte wt me in ye dayes when he loked on me to take from me the rebuke yt I suffred amonge men .
42001026	And in ye . vi . moneth ye angell Gabriel was sent fro god vnto a cite of Galile named Nazareth
42001027	to a virgin spoused to a man whose name was Ioseph of ye housse of David and ye virgins name was Mary .
42001028	And ye angell went in vnto her and sayde : Hayle full of grace ye Lorde is with ye : blessed arte thou amonge wemen .
42001029	When she sawe him she was abasshed at his sayinge : and cast in her mynde what maner of salutacion yt shuld be .
42001030	And ye angell sayde vnto her : feare not Mary : for thou hast founde grace wt god .
42001031	Loo : thou shalt coceave in thy wombe and shalt beare a sonne and shalt call his name Iesus .
42001032	He shalbe greate and shalbe called the sonne of the hyest . And ye lorde God shall geve vnto him the seate of his father David
42001033	and he shall raygne over ye housse of Iacob forever and of his kyngdome shalbe none ende .
42001034	Then sayd Mary vnto ye angell : How shall this be seinge I knowe not a man ?
42001035	And ye angell answered and sayd vnto her : The holy goost shall come apon the and ye power of ye hyest shall over shaddowe ye . Therfore also yt holy thinge which shalbe borne shalbe called ye sonne of god .
42001036	And beholde thy cosen Elizabeth she hath also conceaved a sonne in her age . And this is hyr sixte moneth though she be called barren :
42001037	for wt god can nothinge be vnpossible .
42001038	And Mary sayd : beholde ye honde mayden of ye lorde be it vnto me even as thou hast sayde . And the angell departed from her .
42001039	And Mary arose in thoose dayes and went into ye mountayns wt hast into a cite of Iurie
42001040	and entred into the housse of zachary and saluted Elizabeth .
42001041	And it fortuned as Elizabeth hearde ye salutacion of Mary the babe spronge in her belly . And Elizabeth was filled with the holy goost
42001042	and cryed with a loude voyce and sayde : Blessed arte thou amonge wemen and blessed is the frute of thy wombe .
42001043	And whence hapeneth this to me that the mother of my Lorde shuld come to me ?
42001044	For loo assone as the voyce of thy salutacion sownded in myne eares the babe sprange in my belly for ioye .
42001045	And blessed arte thou that belevedst : for thoose thinges shalbe performed wich were tolde ye from the lorde .
42001046	And Mary sayde . My soule magnifieth the Lorde .
42001047	And my sprete reioyseth in god my savioure
42001048	For he hath loked on the povre degre of his honde mayde . Beholde now from hence forth shall all generacions call me blessed .
42001049	For he that is myghty hath done to me greate thinges and holye is his name .
42001050	And his mercy is on them that feare him thorow oute all generacions .
42001051	He sheweth strength with his arme he scattereth them that are proude in the ymaginacion of their hertes .
42001052	He putteth doune the myghty from their seates and exalteth them of lowe degre .
42001053	He filleth the hongry with good thinges : and sendeth awaye the ryche emptye .
42001054	He remenbreth mercy : and helpeth his servaunt Israel .
42001055	Even as he promised to oure fathers Abraham and to his seede for ever .
42001056	And mary aboode with hyr aboute a . iii . monethes and retourned agayne to hyr awne housse .
42001057	Elizabethes tyme was come that she shuld be delyvered and she brought forth a sonne .
42001058	And her neghboures and her cosins hearde tell how the lorde had shewed great mercy vpon her and they reioysed with her .
42001059	And it fortuned ye eyght daye : they cam to circumcise the chylde : and called his name zacharias after the name of his father .
42001060	How be it his mother answered and sayd : not so but he shalbe called Ihon .
42001061	And they sayd vnto hyr : Ther is none of thy kynne that is named wt this name .
42001062	And they made signes to his father how he wolde have him called .
42001063	And he axed for wrytynge tables and wroote saying : his name is Iohn . And they marvelled all .
42001064	And his mouthe was opened immediatly and his tonge also and he spake lawdynge God .
42001065	And feare came on all the that dwelt nye vnto them . And all these sayinges were noysed abroade throughout all ye hyll coutre of Iurie
42001066	and all they yt herde the layde them vp in their hertes saying : What maner chylde shall this be ? And the honde of ye lorde was with him .
42001067	And his father zacharias was filled with the holy goost and prophisyed sayinge :
42001068	Blessed be the Lorde God of Israel for he hath visited and redemed his people .
42001069	And hath reysed vp an horne of salvacion vnto vs in the housse of his servaunt David .
42001070	Even as he promised by ye mouth of his holy prophetes which were sens ye worlde began
42001071	That we shuld be saved from oure enemies and from the hondis of all that hate vs :
42001072	To fulfill the mercy promised to oure fathers and to remember his holy covenaunt .
42001073	And to performe the oothe which he sware to oure father Adraham
42001074	for to geve vs . That we delyvered oute of ye hondes of oure enemyes myght serve him with oute feare
42001075	all the dayes of oure lyfe in suche holynes and ryghtewesnes that are accept before him .
42001076	And thou chylde shalt be called the Prophet of the hyest : for thou shalt goo before the face of the lorde to prepare his wayes :
42001077	And to geve knowlege of salvacion vnto his people for the remission of synnes :
42001078	Through the tender mercy of oure God wherby the daye springe from an hye hath visited vs .
42001079	To geve light to the that sate in darcknes and in shadowe of deth and to gyde oure fete into the waye of peace .
42001080	And the chylde grew and wexed stronge in sprete and was in wyldernes tyll the daye cam when he shuld shewe him sylfe vnto the Israhelites .
42002001	And it chaunced in thoose dayes : yt ther went oute a comaundment from Auguste the Emperour that all the woorlde shuld be taxed .
42002002	And this taxynge was ye fyrst and executed when Syrenius was leftenaut in Syria .
42002003	And every man went vnto his awne citie to be taxed .
42002004	And Ioseph also ascended from Galile oute of a cite called Nazareth into Iurie : vnto ye cite of David which is called Bethleem because he was of the housse and linage of David
42002005	to be taxed with Mary his spoused wyfe which was with chylde .
42002006	And it fortuned whyll they were there her tyme was come that she shuld be delyvered .
42002007	And she brought forth her fyrst begotten sonne and wrapped him in swadlynge cloothes and layed him in a manger because ther was no roume for them within in the ynne .
42002008	And ther were in the same region shepherdes abydinge in the felde and watching their flocke by nyght .
42002009	And loo : the angell of ye lorde stode harde by the and the brightnes of ye lorde shone rounde aboute them and they were soare afrayed .
42002010	But the angell sayd vnto them : Be not afrayed . For beholde I bringe you tydinges of greate ioye yt shal come to all ye people :
42002011	for vnto you is borne this daye in the cite of David a saveoure which is Christ ye lorde .
42002012	And take this for a signe : ye hall fynde ye chylde swadled and layed in a mager .
42002013	And streight waye ther was with the angell a multitude of hevenly sowdiers laudynge God and sayinge :
42002014	Glory to God an hye and peace on the erth : and vnto men reioysynge .
42002015	And it fortuned assone as the angels were gone awaye fro them in to heven the shepherdes sayd one to another : let vs goo eve vnto Bethleem and se this thynge that is hapened which the Lorde hath shewed vnto vs .
42002016	And they cam with haste and founde Mary and Ioseph and the babe layde in a mager .
42002017	And when they had sene it they publisshed a brode the sayinge which was tolde them of that chylde .
42002018	And all that hearde it wondred at those thinges which were tolde the of the shepherdes .
42002019	But Mary kept all thoose sayinges and pondered them in hyr hert .
42002020	And the shepherdes retourned praysinge and laudinge God for all that they had herde and sene evyn as it was told vnto them .
42002021	And when ye eyght daye was come yt the chylde shuld be circucised his name was called Iesus which was named of the angell before he was conceaved in the wombe .
42002022	And when the tyme of their purificacio ( after the lawe of Moyses ) was come they brought him to Hierusalem to present hym to ye Lorde
42002023	( as yt is written in the lawe of the Lorde : every man that fyrst openeth the matrix shalbe called holy to the Lorde )
42002024	and to offer ( as it ys sayde in the lawe of the Lorde ) a payre of turtle doves or two yonge pigions .
42002025	And beholde ther was a ma in Hierusalem whose name was Simeon . And the same ma was iuste and feared God and longed for the consolacion of Israel and the holy goost was in him .
42002026	And an answer was geven him of the holy goost that he shulde not se deethe before he had sene the lordes Christ .
42002027	And he came by inspiracion into the temple . And when the father and mother brought in the chylde Iesus to do for him after the custome of the lawe
42002028	then toke he him vp in his armes and sayde .
42002029	Lorde Now lettest thou thy seruaut departe in peace accordinge to thy promes .
42002030	For myne eyes have sene ye saveour sent fro ye
42002031	Wich thou hast prepared before the face of all people .
42002032	A light to lighten the gentyls and the glory of thy people Israel .
42002033	And his father and mother mervelled at those thinges which were spoke of him .
42002034	And Simeon blessed them and sayde vnto Mary his mother : beholde this chyld shalbe the fall and resurreccio of many in Israel and a signe which shalbe spoke agaynste .
42002035	And morover the swearde shall pearce thy soule yt the thoughtes of many hertes maye be opened .
42002036	And ther was a Prophetesse one Anna the doughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Aser : which was of a greate age and had lyved with an husbande . vii . yeres from her virginite .
42002037	And she had bene a wedowe aboute . iiii . scoore and . iiii . yere which went never oute of the temple but served God with fastinge and prayer nyght and daye .
42002038	And the same came forth that same houre and praysed the Lorde and spake of him to all that loked for redempcion in Hierusalem .
42002039	And assone as they had performed all thinges accordinge to the lawe of the Lorde they returned into Galile to their awne cite Nazareth .
42002040	And the chylde grewe and wexed stronde in sprete and was filled with wysdome and the grace of God was with hym .
42002041	And his father and mother went to Hierusalem every yeare at the feeste of ester .
42002042	And when he was . xii . yere olde they went vp to Hierusalem after the custome of the feeste .
42002043	And when they had fulfilled the dayes as they returned home the chylde Iesus boode styll in Hierusalem vnknowynge to his father and mother .
42002044	For they supposed he had bene in the copany and therfore came a days iorney and sought him amoge their kynsfolke and acquayntaunce .
42002045	And when they founde hym not they went backe agayne to Hierusalem and sought him .
42002046	And it fortuned after . iii . dayes that they founde him in the teple sittinge in the middes of the doctours both hearynge them and posinge them .
42002047	And all that hearde him mervelled at his wit and answers .
42002048	And when they sawe him they were astonyed . And his mother sayde vnto him : sonne why hast thou thus dealte with vs ? Beholde thy father and I have sought the sorowenge .
42002049	And he sayde vnto the : how is it yt ye sought me ? Wist ye not that I must goo aboute my fathers busines ?
42002050	And they vnderstode not ye sayinge that he spake to them .
42002051	And he went with them and came to Nazareth and was obedient to the . But his mother kept all these thinges in her hert .
42002052	And Iesus increased in wisdom and age and in favoure with god and man .
42003001	In the fiftenthe yeare of the raygne of Tiberius the Emperoure Pontius Pylate beinge leftenaut of Iurie and Herode beinge Tetrach of Galile and his brother Philip Tetrach in Iturea and in the region of Traconites and Lysanias the Tetrach of Abyline
42003002	when Anna and Cayphas were the hye prestes : the worde of God came vnto Iohn ye sonne of zacharias in the wildernes .
42003003	And he came in to all the coostes aboute Iordan preachynge the baptyme of repentaunce for the remission of synnes
42003004	at it is written in the boke of the sayinges of Esaias ye Prophet which sayeth : The voyce of a cryar in wyldernes prepare the waye of the Lorde make hys pathes strayght .
42003005	Every valley shalbe fylled and every moutayne and hyll shalbe brought lowe . And crocked thinges shalbe made streight : and the rough wayes shalbe made smoth :
42003006	and all flesshe shall se the saveour sent of God .
42003007	Then sayde he to the people that were come to be baptysed of him : O generacion of vipers who hath taught you to flye from the wrath to come ?
42003008	Bringe forth due frutes of repentaunce and begynne not to saye in youre selves we have Abraham to oure father . For I saye vnto you : God is able of these stones to reyse vp chyldren vnto Abraham .
42003009	Now also ys the axe leyd vnto the rote of the trees : so yt every tree which bringeth not forth good frute shalbe hewe doune and caste in to ye fyre .
42003010	And the people axed him sayinge : What shall we do then ?
42003011	He answered and sayde vnto them : He that hath two coottes let him parte with him that hath none : and he that hath meate let him do lyke wyse .
42003012	Then came ther Publicans to be baptised and sayde vnto him : Master what shall we do ?
42003013	And he sayde vnto the : requyre no more then that which ys appoynted vnto you .
42003014	The soudyoures lyke wyse demaunded of hym sayinge : and what shall we do ? And he sayde to them : Do violence to noo ma : nether trouble eny man wrongfully : but be content with youre wages .
42003015	As the people were in a doute and all men disputed in their hertes of Iohn whether he were very Christ :
42003016	Ihon answered and sayde to them all : I baptyse you wt water but a stronger then I cometh after me whose shue latchet I am not worthy to vnlouse : he will baptise you with the holy goost and with fyre :
42003017	which hath his fanne in his hond and will pourge his floore and will gader the corne into his barne : but the chaffe wyll he bourne with fyre that never shalbe quenched .
42003018	And many other thinges in his exhortacion preached he vnto the people .
42003019	Then Herode the Tetrach ( when he was rebuked of him for Herodias his brother Philippes wyfe and for all the evyls which Herod had done )
42003020	added this above all and leyd Iohn in preson .
42003021	And yt fortuned as all the people receaved baptyme ( and when Iesus was baptised and dyd praye ) that heave was opened
42003022	and the holy goost came doune in a bodely shape lyke a dove vpo him and a voyce came fro heve sayinge : Thou arte my dere sonne in the do I delyte .

42004001	Iesus then full of the holy goost returnyd fro Iordan and was caryed of ye sprete into wildernes
42004002	and was . xl . dayes tempted of the devyll . And in thoose dayes ate he no thinge . And when they were ended he afterward hongred .
42004003	And the devyll sayde vnto him : yf thou be the sonne of God comaunde this stone yt it be breed .
42004004	And Iesus answered hym sayinge : It is writte : man shall not live by breed only but by every worde of God .
42004005	And ye devyll toke him vp into an hye moutayne and shewed him all the kyngdoms of the worlde eve in ye twincklinge of an eye .
42004006	And ye devyll sayde vnto him : all this power will I geve ye every whit and the glory of the : for yt is delyvered to me and to whosoever I will I geve it .
42004007	Yf thou therfore wilt worshippe me they shalbe all thyne .

42004010	For it is written he shall geve his angels charge over the to kepe the
42004011	and with there hondis they shall stey the vp that thou dasshe not thy fote agaynst a stone .
42004012	Iesus answered and sayde to him it is sayd : thou shalt not tempte the Lorde thy God .
42004013	Assone as the devyll had ended all his temptacions he departed from him for a season .
42004014	And Iesus retourned by the power of ye sprete in to Galile and there went a fame of him thorowe oute all the regio roude aboute .
42004015	And he taught in their synagoges and was commended of all men .
42004016	And he came to Nazareth where he was noursed and as hys custome was went in to the synagoge on the Saboth dayes and stode vp for to rede .
42004017	And ther was delyvered vnto him ye boke of ye Prophete Esaias . And when he had opened the boke he founde the place where it was written .
42004018	The sprete of the lorde vpon me because he hath annoynted me : to preache ye gospell to ye poore he hath sent me : and to heale the broken harted : to preache delyverauce to the captive and sight to the blinde and frely to set at lyberte them that are brused
42004019	and to preache the acceptable yeare of the Lorde .
42004020	And he cloosed the booke and gave it agayne to the minister and sate doune . And the eyes of all that were in the synagoge were fastened on him .
42004021	And he began to saye vnto them . This daye is this scripture fulfilled in youre eares .
42004022	And all bare him witnes and wondred at the gracious wordes which proceded oute of his mouth and sayde : Is not this Iosephs sonne ?
42004023	And he sayde vnto them : Ye maye very well saye vnto me this proverbe : Phisicion heale thy silfe . Whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum do the same here lyke wyse in thyne awne countre .
42004024	And he sayde verely I saye vnto you : No Prophet is accepted in his awne countre .
42004025	But I tell you of a truth many wyddowes were in Israell in the dayes of Helias when hevyn was shet thre yeres and syxe monethes when greate fammisshemet was throughoute all the londe
42004026	and vnto none of them was Helias sent save in to Sarephta besydes Sidon vnto a woma that was a widow .
42004027	And many lepers were in Israel in the tyme of Heliseus the Prophete : and yet none of them was healed savinge Naaman of Siria .
42004028	And as many as were in ye sinagoge when they herde that were filled with wrath :
42004029	and roose vp and thrust him oute of the cite and ledde him eve vnto the edge of the hill wher on their cite was bilte to cast him doune hedlynge .
42004030	But he went his waye eve thorow the myddes of them :
42004031	and came in to Capernaum a cyte of Galile and there taught the on the Saboth dayes .
42004032	And they were astonyed at his doctrine : for his preachige was wt power .
42004033	And in the synagoge ther was a ma which had a sprete of an vncleane devell and cryed with aloude voyce
42004034	sayinge : let me alone what hast thou to do with vs thou Iesus of Nazareth ? Arte thou come to destroye vs ? I knowe the what thou arte eve the holy of God .
42004035	And Iesus rebuked him sayinge : holde thy peace and come oute of him . And the devyll threwe him in the myddes of them and came oute of him and hurt him not .
42004036	And feare came on them all and they spake amonge them selves sayinge : what maner a thinge is this ? For with auctorite and power he commaundeth the foule spretes and they come out ?
42004037	And ye fame of him spreed abroode thorowoute all places of the countre round aboute .
42004038	And he roose vp and came oute of ye sinagoge and entred in to Simons housse . And Simos motherelawe was take with a greate fever and they made intercession to him for her .
42004039	And he stode over her and rebuked the fever : and it leeft her . And immediatly she arose and ministred vnto them .
42004040	When the sonne was doune all they that had sicke take with divers deseases brought them vnto him : and he layde his hondes on every one of them and healed them .
42004041	And devils also cam out of many of them crying and saying : thou arte Christ the sonne of God . And he rebuked them and suffered them not to speake : for they knewe that he was Christ .
42004042	Assone as it was daye he departed and went awaye into a desert place and ye people sought him and came to him and kept him that he shuld not departe from the .
42004043	And he sayde vnto the : I muste to other cities also preache the kyngdome of God : for therfore am I sent .
42004044	And he preached in the synagoges of Galile .
42005001	It came to passe as the people preased vpon him to heare the worde of God that he stoode by the lake of Genezareth :
42005002	and sawe two shippes stonde by the lake syde but the fisshermen were gone out of the and were wasshynge their nettes .
42005003	And he entred in to one of the shippes which perteyned to Simon and prayed him that he wolde thrust out a litell from the londe . And he sate doune and taught the people out of the ship .
42005004	When he had leeft speakynge he sayde vnto Simon : Launche out in to the depe and let slippe youre nettes to make a draught
42005005	And Simon answered and sayde to him : Master we have labored all nyght and have taken nothinge . Neverthelater at thy worde I will loose forthe the net .
42005006	And when they had so done they inclosed a greate multitude of fisshes . And their net brake :
42005007	but they made signes to their felowes which were in the other ship that they shuld come and helpe the And they came : and filled bothe the shippes that they soncke agayne .
42005008	When Simon Peter sawe that he fell doune at Iesus knees sayinge : Lorde goo
42005009	fro me for I am a synfull man . For he was vtterly astonyed and all that were wt him at ye draught of fisshe which they toke :
42005010	and so was also Iames and Iohn ye sonnes of zebede which were parteners wt Simon . And Iesus sayde vnto Simon : feare not fro hence forthe thou shalt catche men .
42005011	And they brought the shippes to londe and forsoke all and folowed him .
42005012	And it fortuned as he was in a certayne cite : beholde ther was a man full of leprosy : and when he had spied Iesus he fell on his face and besought him sayinge : Lorde yf thou wilt thou canst make me cleane .
42005013	And he strethed forth ye hond and touched him sayinge : I will be thou cleane . And immediatly the leprosy departed from him .
42005014	And he warned him that he shuld tell no man : but that he shuld goo and shewe him selfe to the Preste and offer for his clensynge accordinge as Moses commaundement was for a witnes vnto them .
42005015	But so moche the moare went ther a fame abroade of him and moche people cam to geder to heare and to be healed of him of their infirmities .
42005016	And he kepte him silfe aparte in ye wildernesses and gave him silfe to prayer .
42005017	And it happened on a certayne daye that he taught : and ther sate the pharises : and docturs of lawe which were come out of all ye tounes of Galile Iurie and Hierusalem . And the power of the Lorde was to heale the .
42005018	And beholde me brought a man lyinge in his beed which was taken with a palsie : and sought meanes to brynge him in and to laye him before him .
42005019	And whe they coulde not finde by what waye they might bringe him in be cause of ye prease they wet vp on the toppe of ye housse and let him doune thorowe the tylinge beed and all in the middes before Iesus .
42005020	When he sawe their fayth he sayde vnto him : man thy synnes are forgeven the .
42005021	And the Scribes and the Parises begane to thinke sayinge : What felow is this which speaketh blasphemy ? Who can forgeve synnes but God only ?
42005022	When Iesus perceaved their thoughtes he answered and sayde vnto them : What thinke ye in youre hertes ?
42005023	Whether is easyar to saye thy synnes are forgeve the or to saye : rise and walke ?
42005024	But that ye maye knowe that the sonne of ma hath power to forgeve synnes on erth he sayde vnto ye sicke of the palsie : I saye to the aryse take vp thy beed and go home to thy housse .
42005025	And immediatly he rose vp before them and toke vp his beed where on he laye and departed to his awne housse praysinge God .
42005026	And they were all amased and they lauded God and were filled with feare sayinge : We have sene straunge thynges to daye .
42005027	And after that he went forthe and sawe a Publican named Levi sittinge at the receyte of custome and sayde vnto him : folow me .
42005028	And he leeft all roose vp and folowed him .
42005029	And that same Levi made him a greate feaste at home in his awne housse . And ther was a greate copany of publicans and of other that sate at meate with him .
42005030	And the Scribes and Pharises murmured agaynst his disciples sayinge : Why eate ye and drinke ye with publicas and synners ?
42005031	Iesus answered and sayde vnto the : They yt are whole nede not of ye phisicion : but they yt are sicke .
42005032	I came not to call ye rightewes but synners to repentauce .
42005033	Then they sayde vnto him : Why do the disciples of Iohn fast often and praye and the disciples of ye Pharises also : and thine eate and drinke ?
42005034	And he sayde vnto them : Can ye make ye chyldren of the weddinge fast as longe as ye brydgrome is present with the ?
42005035	The dayes will come whe the brydgrome shalbe take awaye from them : then shall they fast in those dayes
42005036	Then he spake vnto them in a similitude : No ma putteth a pece of a newe garment in to an olde vesture : for yf he do : then breaketh he the newe and the pece that was taken out of the newe agreeth not wt the olde .
42005037	Also no ma poureth newe wyne into olde vessels . For yf he do the newe wyne breaketh the vessels and runneth out it silfe and the vessels perisshe :
42005038	But newe wyne must be poured into newe vessels and bothe are preserved .
42005039	Also no man yt drinketh olde wine strayght waye can awaye with newe for he sayeth ye olde is plesauter .
42006001	It happened on an after saboth that he went thorow the corne felde and that his disciples plucked the eares of corne and ate and rubbed them in their hondes .
42006002	And certayne of the Pharises sayde vnto them : Why do ye that which is not laufull to do on the saboth dayes ?
42006003	And Iesus answered them and sayde : Have ye not redde what David dyd when he him sylfe was anhungred and they which were with him :
42006004	how he went into the housse of God and toke and ate the loves of halowed breed and gave also to them which were with him : which was not laufull to eate but for the prestes only .
42006005	And he sayde vnto them : The sonne of man is Lorde of the saboth daye .
42006006	And it fortuned in a nother saboth also that he entred in to ye sinagoge and taught . And ther was a ma whose right honde was dryed vp .
42006007	And ye Scribes and Pharises watched him to se whether he wolde heale on the Saboth daye that they myght fynde an accusacion agaynst him .
42006008	But he knewe their thoughtes and sayde to the man which had ye wyddred honde : Ryse vp and stonde forthe in the myddes . And he arose and stepped forthe .
42006009	Then sayde Iesus vnto them : I will axe you a question : Whether is it laufull on the saboth dayes to do good or to do evill ? to save lyfe or for to destroye it ?
42006010	And he behelde them all in copasse and sayd vnto ye man : Stretche forth thy honde . And he dyd so and his honde was restored and made as whoole as the other .
42006011	And they were filled full of madnes and comuned one with another what they myght do to Iesu .
42006012	And it fortuned in thoose dayes that he went out into a mountayne for to praye and cotinued all nyght in prayer to god .
42006013	And assone as it was daye he called his disciples and of the he chose twelve which also he called apostles .
42006014	Simon who he named Peter : and Andrew his brother . Iames and Iho Philip and Bartlemew
42006015	Mathew and Thomas Iames the sonne of Alpheus and Simon called zelotes
42006016	and Iudas Iames sonne and Iudas Iscarioth which same was the traytour .
42006017	And he came doune with them and stode in the playne felde with the company of his disciples and agreate multitude of people out of all parties of Iurie and Ierusalem and from the see cooste of Tire and Sidon which came to heare hym and to be healed of their diseases :
42006018	and they also that were vexed with foule spretes and they were healed .
42006019	And all the people preased to touche him : for there went vertue out of him and healed them all .
42006020	And he lifted vp his eyes apon the disciples and sayde : Blessed be ye poore : for yours is the kyngdome of God .
42006021	Blessed are ye that honger now : for ye shalbe satisfied . Blessed are ye yt wepe now : for ye shall laugh .
42006022	Blessed are ye when men hate you and thrust you oute of their companye and rayle and abhorre youre name as an evyll thinge for the sonne of manes sake .
42006023	Reioyse ye then and be gladde : for beholde youre rewarde is greate in heven . After this manner their fathers entreated the Prophetes .
42006024	But wo be to you that are ryche : for ye have therin youre consolacion .
42006025	Wo be to you yt are full : for ye shall honger . Wo be to you that now laugh : for ye shall wayle and wepe .
42006026	Wo be to you when all men prayse you : for so dyd their fathers to the false prophetes .
42006027	But I saye vnto you which heare : Love youre enemyes . Do good to the which hate you .
42006028	Blesse the that course you . And praye for the which wrongfully trouble you .
42006029	And vnto him that smyteth the on the one cheke offer also ye other . And him that taketh awaye thy goune forbid not to take thy coote also .
42006030	Geve to every man that axeth of the . And of him that taketh awaye thy goodes axe them not agayne .
42006031	And as ye wolde that men shuld doo to you : so do ye to them lyke wyse .
42006032	If ye love the which love you : what thanke are ye worthy of ? For the very synners love their lovers .
42006033	And yf ye do for them which do for you : what thanke are ye worthy of ? For the very synners do even the same .
42006034	If ye lende to them of whome ye hoope to receave : what thanke shall ye have : for the very synners lende to synners to receave as moch agayne .
42006035	Wherfore love ye youre enemys do good and lende lokynge for nothinge agayne and youre rewarde shalbe greate and ye shalbe the chyldren of the hyest : for he is kynde vnto the vnkynde and to the evyll .
42006036	Be ye therfore mercifull as youre father is mercifull .
42006037	Iudge not and ye shall not be Iudged . Condemne not : and ye shall not be condemned . Forgeve and ye shalbe forgeven .
42006038	Geve and yt shalbe geven vnto you : good measure pressed doune shaken to geder and runnynge over shall men geve into youre bosomes . For with what measure ye mete with ye same shall men mete to you agayne .
42006039	And he put forthe a similitude vnto the : Can the blynde leade ye blynde ? Do they not both then fall into ye dyche ?
42006040	The disciple is not above his master . Every ma shalbe perfecte even as his master is .
42006041	Why seyst thou a moote in thy brothers eye considerest not ye beame yt is in thyne awne eye ?
42006042	Ether how canest thou saye to thy brother : Brother let me pull out ye moote that is in thyne eye : when thou perceavest not the beame that is in thyne awne eye ? Ypocrite cast out ye beame out of thyne awne eye fyrst and then shalt thou se perfectly to pull out the moote out of thy brothers eye .
42006043	It is not a good tree that bringeth forthe evyll frute : nether is that an evyll tree that bringeth forthe good frute
42006044	For every tree is knowen by his frute . Nether of thornes gader men fygges nor of busshes gader they grapes .
42006045	A good man out of the good treasure of his hert bringeth forthe that which is good . And an evyll man out of the evyll treasure of his hert bringeth forthe that which ys evyll . For of the aboundaunce of ye her his mouthe speakethe .
42006046	Why call ye me Master Master : and do not as I bid you ?
42006047	whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayinges and dothe the same I will shewe you to whome he ys lyke .
42006048	He is like a man which bilt an housse : and digged depe and layde the foundacio on a rocke . Whe the waters arose the fludde bet apo that housse and coulde not move yt . For it was grounded apon a rocke .
42006049	But he that heareth and doth not is lyke a man that with out foundacion bylt an housse apon the erth agaynst which the fludde did bet : and it fell by and by . And ye fall of yt housse was greate .
42007001	When he had ended all his sainges in the audience of the people he entred into Capernau .
42007002	And a certayne Centurions seruaunte was sicke and redy to dye whom he made moche of .
42007003	And when he hearde of Iesu he sent vnto him the elders of the Iewes besechinge him yt he wolde come and heale his servaunt .
42007004	And they came to Iesus and besought him instantly sayinge : He is worthi that thou shuldest do this for him .
42007005	For he loveth oure nacion and hath bilt vs a sinagoge
42007006	And Iesus went with them . And when he was not farre fro the housse the Centurio sent frendes to him sayinge vnto him : Lorde trouble not thy silfe : for I am not worthy yt thou shuldest enter vnder my roffe .
42007007	Wherfore I thought not my silfe worthy to come vnto the : but saye the worde and my servaunt shalbe whoole .
42007008	For I lyke wyse am a man vnder power and have vnder me soudiers and I saye vnto won goo : and he goeth . And to another come : and he cometh . And to my servaunt do this : and he doeth it .
42007009	When Iesus herde this he merveyled at him and turned him about and sayd to the people that folowed him : I saye vnto you I have not founde so greate faith noo not in Israel .
42007010	And they yt were sent turned backe home agayne and founde the servaunt that was sicke whoole .
42007011	And it fortuned after that that he went into a cite called Naim and many of his disciples went wt him and moche people .
42007012	When he came nye to the gate of the cite : beholde ther was a deed man caried out which was ye only sonne of his mother and she was a widowe and moche people of the cite was with her .
42007013	And when ye lorde sawe her he had compassion on her and sayde vnto her : wepe not .
42007014	And he went and touched the coffyn and they yt bare him stode still . And he sayde : Yonge man I saye vnto the aryse .
42007015	And ye deed sate vp and beganne to speake . And he delyvered him to his mother .
42007016	And ther ca a feare on the all . And they glorified god sayinge : a greate prophet is rysen amoge vs and god hath visited his people
42007017	And this rumor of him wet forthe throughout all Iurie and thorowout all the regions which lye rounde about .
42007018	And ye disciples of Iohn shewed him of all these thinges .
42007019	And Iohn called vnto him . ii . of his disciples and sent the to Iesus sayinge : Arte thou he that shall come : or shall we loke for another ?
42007020	When the men were come vnto him they sayde : Iohn baptiste sent vs vnto ye sayinge : Arte thou he that shall come : or shall we wayte for another ?
42007021	And at yt same tyme he cured many of their infirmites and plages and of evyll spretes and vnto many that were blynde he gave sight
42007022	And Iesus answered and sayd vnto them : Goo youre wayes and shewe Iohn what thinges ye have sene and harde : how yt the blynde se the halt goo the lepers are clensed the deafe heare the deed aryse to the poore is the glad tydinges preached
42007023	and happy is he that is not offended by me .
42007024	When ye messengers of Iohn were departed he began to speake vnto ye people of Iohn What wet ye oute into ye wildernes for to se ? went ye to se arede shaken wt ye wynde ?
42007025	But what went ye out for tose ? A ma clothed in soofte rayment ? Beholde they which are gorgeously apparelled and lyve delicatly are in kynges courtes .
42007026	But what went ye forth to se ? A prophete ? Ye I saye to you and moare then a prophete
42007027	This is he of who it is wrytte : Beholde I sende my messenger before thy face to prepare thy waye before the .
42007028	For I saye vnto you : a greater prophete then Iohn amoge wemes chyldre is ther none . Neverthelesse one yt is lesse in ye kyngdo of god is greater the he
42007029	And all the people that hearde and the publicans iustified God and were baptised with the baptim of Iohn .
42007030	But the pharises and scribes despised ye counsell of god agaynst them selves and were not baptised of him .
42007031	And ye lorde sayd : Wher vnto shall I lyke the men of this generacion and what thinge are they lyke ?
42007032	They are lyke vnto chyldre sittynge in ye market place and cryinge one to another and sayinge : We have pyped vnto you and ye hahave not daunsed : we have mourned to you and ye have not wept .
42007033	For Iohn baptist cam nether eatynge breed ner drinkynge wyne and ye saye : he hath the devyll .
42007034	The sonne of man is come and eateth and drinketh and ye saye : beholde a man which is a glotton and a drinker of wyne a frende of publicans and synners .
42007035	Yet is wysdome iustified of all her chyldren .
42007036	And one of the pharises desyred him that he wolde eate with him . And he went into ye pharises housse and sate doune to meate .
42007037	And beholde a woman in that cite which was a synner assone as she knewe that . Iesus sate at meate in the pharises housse she brought an alablaster boxe of oyntmet
42007038	and she stode at his fete behynde him wepynge and beganne to wesshe his fete with teares and dyd wipe the with the heares of her heed and kyssed his fete and anoynted them with oyntment .
42007039	When the pharise which bade him sawe that he spake with in him sylfe sayinge : If this man were a prophete he wolde surely have knowen who and what maner woman this is which toucheth him for she is a synner .
42007040	And Iesus answered and sayde vnto him : Simon I have some what to saye vnto ye . And he sayd master saye on .
42007041	There was a certayne lender which had two detters ye one ought five hondred pence and the other fyfty .
42007042	When they had nothinge to paye he forgave the boothe . Which of them tell me will love him moost ?
42007043	Simon answered and sayde : I suppose that he to whom he forgave moost . And he sayde vnto him : Thou hast truly iudged .
42007044	And he turned to the woman and sayde vnto Simon : Seist thou this woman ? I entred into thy housse and thou gavest me noo water to my fete but she hath wesshed my fete with teares and wiped the with the heeres of her heed .
42007045	Thou gavest me no kysse : but she sence ye tyme I came in hath not ceased to kysse my fete
42007046	Myne heed wt oyle thou dydest not anoynte : but she hath annoynted my fete wt oyntmet .
42007047	Wherefore I saye vnto the : many synnes are forgeve her for she loved moche . To whom lesse is forgeven the same doeth lesse love .
42007048	And he sayde vnto her thy synnes are forgeven ye
42007049	And they yt sate at meate with him beganne to saye within them selves : Who is this which forgeveth synnes also ?
42007050	And he sayde to ye woman : Thy faith hath saved the Goo in peace .
42008001	And it fortuned after that that he him sylfe went throughout cities and tounes preachynge and shewinge ye kyngdom of God and the twelve with him .
42008002	And also certayne wemen which wer healed of evell spretes and infirmities : Mary called Magdalen out of whom went seven devyls
42008003	and Ioanna ye wyfe of Chusa Herodees stewarde and Susanna and many other : which ministred vnto the of their substaunce .
42008004	When moch people were gadred to gether and were come to him out of all cities he spake by a similitude .
42008005	A sower went out to sowe his seede : and as he sowed some fell by the waye syde and it was troden vnder fete and the foules of the ayre devoured it vp .
42008006	And some fell on ston and assone as it was spronge vp it widdred awaye because it lacked moystnes .
42008007	And some fell amonge thornes and ye thornes spronge vp with it and choked it .
42008008	And some fell on good grounde and sproge vp and bare frute an hondred foolde . And as he sayde these thinges he cryed : He that hath eares to heare let him heare .
42008009	And his disciples axed him sayinge : what maner similitude is this ?
42008010	And he sayde : vnto you is it geven to knowe the secretes of the kyngdom of God : but to other in similitudes that when they se they shuld not se : and when they heare they shuld not vnderstonde .
42008011	The similitude is this . The seede is ye worde of God .
42008012	Thoose yt are besyde the waye are they that heare and afterwarde cometh ye devyll and taketh awaye the worde out of their hertes lest they shuld beleve and be saved .
42008013	They on the stonnes are they which when they heare receave the worde with ioye . But these have noo rootes which for a whyle beleve and in tyme of temtacio goo awaye .
42008014	And yt which fell amonge thornes are they which heare and goo forth and are choked wt cares and wt riches and volupteous lyvinge and bringe forth noo frute .
42008015	That in ye good grounde are they which with a good and pure hert heare the worde and kepe it and bringe forth frute with pacience .
42008016	No man lyghteth a candell and covereth it vnder a vessell nether putteth it vnder ye table : but setteth it on a candelsticke that they that enter in maye se ye lyght .
42008017	No thinge is in secret yt shall not come abroode : Nether eny thinge hyd that shall not be knowen and come to lyght .
42008018	Take hede therfore how ye heare . For whosoever hath to him shalbe geve : And whosoever hath not fro him shalbe take even that same which he supposeth that he hath .
42008019	Then came to him his mother and his brethren and coulde not come at him for prease .
42008020	And they tolde him sayinge : Thy mother and thy brethren stonde with out and wolde se the .
42008021	He answered and sayd vnto them : my mother and my brethren are these which heare the worde of God and do it .
42008022	And it chaunsed on a certayne daye that he went into a shippe and his disciples also and he sayde vnto them : Let vs goo over vnto the other syde of the lake . And they Lanched forthe .
42008023	And as they sayled he fell a slepe and there arose a storme of wynde in ye lake and they were fylled with water and were in ieopardy .
42008024	And they went to him and awoke him sayinge : Master Master we are loost . Then he arose and rebuked the wynde and the tempest of water and they ceased and it wexed calme .
42008025	And he sayd vnto the : where is youre faith ? They feared and wondred sayinge one to another : what felowe is this ? for he comaundeth bothe the wyndes and water and they obey him ?
42008026	And they sayled vnto the region of ye Gaderenites which is over agaynst Galile .
42008027	And as he went out to londe ther met him a certayne man out of ye cite which had a devyll longe tyme and ware noo clothes nether aboode in eny housse : but amonge graves .
42008028	When he sawe Iesus he cryed and fell doune before him and with a loude voyce sayde : What have I to do with the Iesus the sonne of the God moost hyest ? I beseche the torment me not .
42008029	Then he comaunded ye foule sprete to come out of the man . For ofte tymes he caught him and he was bounde with chaynes and kept with fetters : and he brake the bondes and was caryed of the fende into wyldernes .
42008030	And Iesus axed him sayinge : what is thy name ? And he sayde : Legion because many devyls were entred into him .
42008031	And they besought him yt he wolde not comaunde the to goo out into ye depe .
42008032	And ther was there by an heerde of many swyne fedynge on an hyll : and they besought him yt he wolde soffre the to enter into the . And he soffred the .
42008033	Then went the devyls out of the man and entred into the swyne : And the heerd toke their course and ran heedlynge into the lake and were choked .
42008034	When the herdmen sawe what had chaunsed they fleed and tolde it in the cite and in the villages .
42008035	And they came out to se what was done : and came to Iesus and founde ye man out of who the devyls were departed sittynge at the fete of Iesus clothed and in his right mynde and they were afrayde .
42008036	They also wich sawe it tolde the by what meanes he yt was possessed of ye devyll was healed .
42008037	And all the whole multitude of ye cotrye of the Gaderenites besought him yt he wolde departe from the : for they were taken wt greate feare . And he gate him into the shippe and returned backe agayne .
42008038	Then the man out of whom the devyls were departed besought him yt he myght be wt him : But Iesus sent him awaye sayinge :
42008039	Goo home agayne into thyne awne housse and shewe what great thinges God hath done to ye . And he went his waye and preached thorow out all the cite what great thinges Iesus had done vnto him .
42008040	And it fortuned when Iesus was come agayne that ye people receaved him . For they all wayted for him .
42008041	And beholde ther came a man named Iairus ( and he was a ruler of ye synagoge ) and he fell doune at Iesus fete and besought him yt he wolde come into his housse
42008042	for he had but a doughter only apon a twelve yere of age and she laye a dyinge . And as he went the people thronged him .
42008043	And a woman havynge an issue of bloud twelve yeres ( which had spent all her substance amonge phisicios nether coulde be holpen of eny )
42008044	came behinde him and touched the hem of his garmet and immediatly her issue of bloud staunched .
42008045	And Iesus sayde : Who is it that touched me ? when every man denyed Peter and they yt were with him sayde : Master the people thrust the and vexe the : and sayest thou who touched me ?
42008046	And Iesus sayd : Some body touched me . For I perceave that vertue is gone out of me .
42008047	When the woman sawe that she was not hid she came trimblynge and fell at is fete and tolde him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediatly .
42008048	And he sayde vnto hyr : Doughter be of good comforte Thy faith hath made the hoale goo in peace .
42008049	Whyll he yet spake there came one from ye rulers of the synagogis housse which sayde to him : thy doughter is deed disease not the master .
42008050	When Iesus hearde that He answered the father sayinge : Feare not beleve only and she shalbe made whole .
42008051	And when he came to ye housse he suffred no man to goo in with him save Peter Iames and Iohn and the father and the mother of the mayden .
42008052	Every body weept and sorowed for her . And he sayde : Wepe not : for she is not deed but slepeth .
42008053	And they lewgh him to scorne . For they knew that she was deed .
42008054	And he thrust the all out and caught her by the honde and cryed sayinge : Mayde aryse .
42008055	And hyr sprete came agayne and she roose strayght waye . And he commaunded to geve her meate .
42008056	And the father and the mother of hyr were astonyed . But he warned the that they shuld tell noo man what was done .
42009001	Then called he the . xii . to gether and gave them power and auctorite over all devyls and that they myght heale diseases .
42009002	And he sent them to preache the kyngdome of God and to cure the sick .
42009003	And he sayd to them : Take nothinge to sucker you by ye waye : nether staffe nor scripe nether breed nether money nether have twoo cootes .
42009004	And whatsoever housse ye enter into there abyde and thence departe .
42009005	And whosoever will not receave you when ye go out of that cite shake of the very dust from youre fete for a testimony agaynst them .
42009006	And they went out and went thorow the tounes preachinge the gospell and healynge every wheare .
42009007	And Herod the tetrarch herde of all that was done of him and douted because that it was sayde of some that Iohn was rysen agayne from deeth :
42009008	and of some that Helyas had apered : and of other that one of the olde prophetes was rysen agayne .
42009009	And Herod sayde : Iohn have I behedded : who then is this of whom I heare suche thinges ? And he desyred to se him .
42009010	And the Apostles retourned and tolde him what great thinges they had done . And he toke them and went a syde into a solitary place nye to a citie called Bethsaida .
42009011	And ye people knewe of it and folowed him . And he receaved them and spake vnto them of the kyngdome of God and healed them that had nede to be healed .
42009012	And when ye daye beganne to weare awaye then came the twelve and sayde vnto him : sende ye people awaye that they maye goo into the tounes and villages roundabout and lodge and get meate for we are here in a place of wyldernes .
42009013	But he sayde vnto them : Geve ye the to eate . And they sayde . We have no moo but fyve loves and two fisshes except we shuld goo and bye meate for all this people .
42009014	And they were about a fyve thousand men . And he sayde to his disciples : Cause them to syt doune by fyfties in a company .
42009015	And they dyd soo and made them all syt doune .
42009016	And he toke the fyve loves and the two fisshes and loked vp to heven and blessed them and brake and gave to the disciples to set before ye people .
42009017	And they ate and were all satisfied . And ther was taken vp of that remayned to the twelve baskettes full of broken meate .
42009018	And it fortuned as he was alone prayinge his disciples were wt him and he axed the sayinge : Who saye ye people yt I am ?
42009019	They answered and sayd : Iohn Baptist . Some saye Helyas . And some saye one of the olde prophetes is rysen agayne .
42009020	He sayde vnto the : Who saye ye that I am ? Peter answered and sayde : thou arte the Christ of god .
42009021	And he warned and commaunded them that they shuld tell no man yt thinge
42009022	sayinge : that the sonne of man must suffre many thinges and be reproved of the elders and of the hye prestes and scribes and be slayne and the thirde daye ryse agayne .
42009023	And he sayde to them all yf eny man will come after me let him denye him sylfe and take vp his crosse dayly and folowe me .
42009024	Whosoever will save his lyfe shall lose it . And who soever shall lose his lyfe for my sake the same shall save it .
42009025	For what avauntageth it a man to wynne the whole worlde yf he loose him sylfe or runne in domage of him sylfe ?
42009026	For whosoever is ashamed of me and of my sayinges : of him shall the sonne of man be ashamed when he cometh in his awne glorie and in the glorie of his father and of the holy angels .
42009027	And I tell you of a surety : There be some of the yt stonde here which shall not tast of deeth tyll they se ye kyngdome of god .
42009028	And it folowed about an . viii . dayes after thoose sayinges that he toke Peter Iames and Iohn and went vp into a moutayne to praye .
42009029	And as he prayed ye facion of his countenaunce was changed and his garment was whyte and shoone .
42009030	And beholde two men talked wt him and they were Moses and Helyas
42009031	which appered gloriously and spake of his departinge which he shuld ende at Ierusalem .
42009032	Peter and they that were with him were hevy with slepe . And when they woke they sawe his glorie and two men stondinge with him .
42009033	And it chaunsed as they departed fro him Peter sayde vnto Iesus : Master it is good beinge here for vs . Let vs make thre tabernacles one for the and one for Moses and one for Helyas : and wist not what he sayde .
42009034	Whyll he thus spake ther came a cloude and shadowed them : and they feared when they were come vnder the cloude .
42009035	And ther came a voyce out of the cloude sayinge : This is my deare sonne heare him .
42009036	And assone as ye voyce was past Iesus was founde alone . And they kept it cloose and tolde noo man in thoose dayes eny of those thinges which they had sene .
42009037	And it chaunsed on the nexte daye as they came doune from the hyll moche people met him .
42009038	And beholde a man of the copany cryed out sayinge : Master I beseche ye beholde my sonne for he is all that I have :
42009039	and se a sprete taketh him and sodenly he cryeth and he teareth him that he fometh agayne and with moche payne departeth fro him when he hath rent him and
42009040	I besought thy disciples to cast him out and they coulde not .
42009041	Iesus answered and sayde : O generacion with oute fayth and croked : how longe shall I be with you ? and shall suffre you ? Bringe thy sonne hidder .
42009042	As he yet was a cominge the fende ret him and tare him . And Iesus rebuked ye vnclene sprete and healed the childe and delivered him to his father .
42009043	And they were all amased at ye mighty power of God . Whyll they wondred every one at all thinges which he dyd he sayd vnto his disciples :
42009044	Let these sayinges synke doune into youre eares . The tyme will come when the sonne of man shalbe delivered into the hondes of men .
42009045	But they wist not what yt worde meant and yt was hyd fro the that they vnderstode yt not . And they feared to axe him of that sayinge .
42009046	Then ther arose a disputacion amoge the : who shuld be the greatest .
42009047	When Iesus perceaved ye thoughtes of their hertes he toke a chylde and set him hard by him
42009048	and sayd vnto the : Whosoever receaveth this chylde in my name receaveth me . And whosoever receaveth me receaveth him yt sent me . For he yt is least amonge you all the same shalbe greate .
42009049	And Iohn answered and sayde : Master we sawe one castinge out devyls in thy name and we forbade him because he foloweth not with vs .
42009050	And Iesus sayde vnto him : forbyd ye him not . For he that is not agaynst vs is wt vs .
42009051	And it folowed when the tyme was come yt he shulde be receaved vp then he set his face to goo to Hierusalem
42009052	and sent messengers before him . And they went and entred into a citie of the Samaritans to make redy for him .
42009053	But they wolde not receave him be cause his face was as though he wolde goo to Ierusalem .
42009054	When his disciples Iames and Iohn sawe yt they sayde : Lorde wilt thou that we comaunde that fyre come doune from heven and consume them even as Helias dyd ?
42009055	Iesus turned about and rebuked them sayinge : ye wote not what maner sprete ye are of .
42009056	The sonne of ma ys not come to destroye mennes lives but to save them . And they went to another toune .
42009057	And it chaunsed as he went in the waye a certayne man sayd vnto him : I will folowe the whither soever thou goo .
42009058	Iesus sayd vnto him : foxes have holes and bryddes of ye ayer have nestes : but the sonne of man hath not where on to laye his heed .
42009059	And he sayde vnto another : folowe me . And the same sayde : Lorde suffre me fyrst to goo and bury my father .
42009060	Iesus sayd vnto him : Let the deed bury their deed : but goo thou and preache the kyngdome of God .
42009061	And another sayde : I wyll folowe the Lorde : but let me fyrst goo byd them fare well which are at home at my housse .
42009062	Iesus sayde vnto him : No man that putteth his honde to the plowe and loketh backe is apte to the kyngdome of God .
42010001	After these thinges the Lorde apoynted other seventie also and sent them two and two before him into every citie and place whither he him silfe wolde come .
42010002	And he sayde vnto them the harvest is greate : but the laborers are feawe . Praye therfore the Lorde of ye harvest to send forth laborers into his hervest .
42010003	Goo youre wayes : beholde I sende you forthe as lambes amonge wolves .
42010004	Beare noo wallet nether scryppe nor shues and salute noo man by the waye .
42010005	Into whatsoever housse ye enter fyrst saye : Peace be to this housse .
42010006	And yf ye sonne of peace be theare youre peace shall rest vpon him : yf not yt shall returne to you agayne .
42010007	And in ye same housse tary still eatinge and drinkinge soche as they have . For the laborer is worthy of his ewarde . Go not fro housse to housse :
42010008	and in to whatso ever citye ye enter yf they receave you eate soche thinges as are set before you
42010009	and heale the sicke yt are theare and saye vnto them : the kyngdome of God is come nye vpon you .
42010010	But into whatsoever citie ye shall enter yf they receave you not goo youre wayes out into the stretes of ye same and saye :
42010011	even the very dust which cleaveth on vs of your citie we wipe of agaynst you : Not withstondinge marke this that ye kyngdome of God was come nie vpon you .
42010012	Ye and I saye vnto you : that it shalbe easier in that daye for Sodom then for yt cytie .
42010013	Wo be to the Chorazin : wo be to ye Bethsaida . For yf ye miracles had bene done in Tyre and Sido which have bene done in you they had a greate whyle agone repeted sitting in heere and asshes .
42010014	Neverthelesse it shalbe easier for Tyre and Sidon at the iudgement then for you .
42010015	And thou Capernau which art exalted to heave shalt be thrust doune to hell .
42010016	He yt heareth you heareth me : and he that dispiseth you despiseth me : and he that dispiseth me despiseth him that sent me .
42010017	And the sevetie returned agayne with ioye sayinge : Lorde even the very devyls are subdued to vs thorowe thy name .
42010018	And he sayde vnto them : I sawe satan as it had bene lightenyng faule doune fro heave .
42010019	Beholde I geve vnto you power to treade on serpetes and scorpions and over all maner power of the enimye and no thinge shall hurte you .
42010020	Neverthelesse in this reioyse not that ye spretes are vnder youre power : but reioyse be cause youre names are wrytten in heaven .
42010021	That same tyme reioysed Iesus in ye sprete and sayde : I confesse vnto ye father Lorde of heaven and erth yt thou hast hyd these thynges from the wyse and prudent and hast opened them to the babes . Even so father for soo pleased it the .
42010022	All thinges are geven me of my father . And no man knoweth who the sonne is but the father : nether who the father is save the sonne and he to who the sonne wyll shewe him .
42010023	And he turned to his disciples and sayde secretly : Happy are ye eyes which se yt ye se .
42010024	For I tell you that many prophetes and kynges have desired to se those thinges which ye se and have not sene them : and to heare those thinges which ye heare and have not hearde them .
42010025	And beholde a certayne Lawere stode vp and tempted him sayinge : Master what shall I do to inheret eternall life ?
42010026	He sayd vnto him : What is written in the lawe ? How redest thou ?
42010027	And he answered and sayde : Loue thy Lorde God with all thy hert and with all thy soule and with all thy stregthe and with all thy mynde : and thy neghbour as thy sylfe .
42010028	And he sayde vnto him : Thou hast answered right . This do and thou shalt live .
42010029	He willinge to iustifie him silfe sayde vnto Iesus : Who is then my neghbour ?
42010030	Iesus answered and sayde : A certayne ma descended fro Hierusalem into Hierico and fell in to the hondes of theves which robbed him of his raymet and wounded him and departed levynge him halfe deed .
42010031	And by chaunce ther came a certayne preste that same waye and when he sawe him he passed by .
42010032	And lykewyse a Levite when he was come nye to the place wet and loked on him and passed by .
42010033	Then a certayne Samaritane as he iornyed came nye vnto him and when he sawe him had compassion on him
42010034	and went to and bounde vp his woundes and poured in oyle and wyne and put him on his awne beaste and brought him to a comen ynne and made provision for him .
42010035	And on the morowe when he departed he toke out two pece and gave them to the host and sayde vnto him . Take cure of him and whatsoever thou spedest moare when I come agayne I will recompence the .
42010036	Which now of these thre thynkest thou was neighbour vnto him yt fell into ye theves hondes ?
42010037	And he sayde : he that shewed mercy on him . Then sayde Iesus vnto him . Goo and do thou lyke wyse .
42010038	It fortuned as they wet that he entred in to a certayne toune . And a certayne woman named Martha receaved him into her housse .
42010039	And this woman had a sister called Mary which sate at Iesus fete and hearde his preachinge .
42010040	And Martha was combred about moche servinge and stode and sayde : Master doest thou not care that my sister hath leeft me to minister alone ? Byd her therfore that she helpe me .
42010041	And Iesus answered and sayde vnto her : Martha Martha thou carest and arte troubled about many thinges :
42010042	verely one is nedfull . Mary hath chosen her that good parte which shall not be taken awaye from her .
42011001	And it fortuned as he was prayinge in a certayne place : when he ceased one of his disciples sayde vnto him : Master teache vs to praye as Iohn taught his disciples .
42011002	And he sayd vnto the : When ye praye saye : O oure father which arte in heave halowed be thy name . Thy kyngdome come . Thy will be fulfilled even in erth as it is in heaven .
42011003	Oure dayly breed geve vs evermore .
42011004	And forgeve vs oure synnes : For eve we forgeve every man yt treaspaseth vs . And ledde vs not into teptacio . But deliver vs fro evill .
42011005	And he sayde vnto them : if any of you shuld have a frede and shuld goo to him at mid nyght and saye vnto him : frende lende me thre loves
42011006	for a frende of myne is come out of the waye to me and I have nothinge to set before him :
42011007	and he within shuld answere and saye trouble me not the dore is now sheet and my servautes are with me in the chamber I canot ryse and geve them to the .
42011008	I saye vnto you though he wold not aryse and geve him because he is his frede : yet because of his importunite he wold rise and geve him as many as he neded .
42011009	And I saye vnto you : axe and it shalbe geven you . Seke and ye shall fynde . knocke and it shalbe opened vnto you .
42011010	For every one that axeth receaveth : and he that seketh fyndeth : and to him that knocketh shall it be openned .
42011011	Yf the sonne shall axe breed of eny of you that is a father : wyll he geve him a stone ? Or yf he axe fisshe wyll he for a fysshe geve him a serpent ?
42011012	Or yf he axe an egge : wyll he offer him a scorpion ?
42011013	Yf ye then which are evyll canne geve good giftes vnto youre chyldren how moche more shall the father of heaven geve an holy sprete to them that desyre it of him ?
42011014	And he was a castynge out a devyll which was dome . And it folowed when the devyll was gone out the domme spake and the people wondred .
42011015	But some of the sayde : he casteth out devyls by the power of Belzebub the chefe of the devyls .
42011016	And other tempted him sekinge of him a signe fro heave .
42011017	But he knewe their thoughtes and sayde vnto them : Every kingdome devided with in it silfe shalbe desolate : and one housse shall fall vpon another .
42011018	So if Satan be devided with in him silfe : how shall his kyngdome endure ? Because ye saye that I cast out devyls by the power of Belzebub .
42011019	Yf I by the power of Belzebub caste oute devyls : by whome do youre chyldren cast them out ? Therfore shall they be youre iudges .
42011020	But if I with ye finger of God cast out devyls noo doute the kyngdome of God is come vpon you .
42011021	When a stronge man armed watcheth his housse : yt he possesseth is in peace .
42011022	But when a stronger then he cometh vpo him and overcometh him : he taketh from him his harnes wherin he trusted and devideth his gooddes .
42011023	He that is not with me is agaynst me . And he that gadereth not with me scattereth .
42011024	When the vnclene sprete is gone out of a man he walketh through waterlesse places sekinge reest . And when he fyndeth none he sayeth : I will returne agayne vnto my housse whence I came out .
42011025	And when he cometh he fyndeth it swept and garnissed .
42011026	Then goeth he and taketh to him seve other spretes worsse then himsilfe : and they enter in and dwell there . And the ende of that man is worsse then the begynninge .
42011027	And it fortuned as he spake those thinges a certayne woman of the copany lyfte vp her voyce and sayde vnto him : Happy is the wombe that bare the and the pappes which gave the sucke .
42011028	But he sayde : Ye happy are they that heare the worde of God and kepe it .
42011029	When the people were gadered thicke to geder : he began to saye . This is an evyll nacion : they seke a signe and ther shall no signe be geven them but the signe of Ionas the Prophet .
42011030	For as Ionas was a signe to the Ninivites so shall ye sonne of ma be to this nacio .
42011031	The quene of the southe shall ryse at iudgement with the men of this generacio and condempne them : for she came fro the ende of the worlde to heare the wysdome of Salomon . And beholde a greater then Salomon is here .
42011032	The men of Ninive shall ryse at the iudgement wt this generacio and shall condepne the : for they repented at the preachinge of Ionas . And beholde a greater then Ionas is here .
42011033	Noo man lighteth a candell and putteth it in a previe place nether vnder a busshell : But on a candelsticke that they that come in maye se ye light .
42011034	The light of thy body is the eye . Therfore when thine eye is single : then is all thy body full of light . But if thine eye be evyll : then shall thy body also be full of darknes .
42011035	Take hede therfore that the light which is in the be not darknes .
42011036	For if all thy body shalbe light havynge noo parte darke : then shall all be full of light even as when a candell doeth light the with his brightnes .
42011037	And as he spake a certayne Pharise besought him to dyne with him : and he went in and sate doune to meate .
42011038	When the Pharise sawe that he marveylled yt he had not fyrst wesshed before dyner .
42011039	And ye Lorde sayde to him : Now do ye Pharises make clene the out side of the cup and of the platter : but youre inwarde parties are full of raveninge and wickednes .
42011040	Ye foles dyd not he that made that which is without : make that which is within also ?
42011041	Neverthelesse geve almose of that ye have and beholde all is clene to you .
42011042	But wo be to you Pharises for ye tithe the mynt and rewe and all manner erbes and passe over iudgment and the love of God . These ought ye to have done and yet not to have left the other vndone .
42011043	Wo be to you Pharises : for ye love the vppermost seates in the synagoges and gretinges in the markets .
42011044	Wo be to you scribes and pharises ypocrites for ye are as graves which appere not and the men yt walke over the are not ware of the .
42011045	Then answered one of the lawears and sayd vnto him : Master thus sayinge thou puttest vs to rebuke also .
42011046	Then he sayde : Wo be to you also ye lawears : for ye lade men with burthens greveous to be borne and ye youre selves touche not ye packes wt one of youre fyngers .
42011047	Wo be to you : ye bylde the sepulchres of the Prophetes and youre fathers killed the :
42011048	truly ye beare witnes that ye alowe the dedes of youre fathers for they kylled them and ye bylde their sepulchres .
42011049	Therfore sayde ye wisdome of God : I will send them Prophetes and Apostles and of them they shall slee and persecute :
42011050	that the bloude of all Prophetes which was sheed fro the beginninge of the worlde maye be requyred of this generacion
42011051	from the bloud of Abell vnto the bloud of zachary which perisshed bitwene the aulter and the temple . Verely I saye vnto you : it shalbe requyred of this nacion .
42011052	Wo be to you lawears : for ye have taken awaye ye keye of knowledge ye entred not in youre selves and them that came in ye forbade .
42011053	When he thus spake vnto them the lawears and the Pharises began to wexe busye about him and to stop his mouth with many questions
42011054	layinge wayte for him and sekinge to catche somethinge of his mought wherby they might accuse him .
42012001	As ther gadered together an innumerable multitude of people ( in so moche that they trood one another ) he began to saye vnto his disciples : Fyrst of all beware of the leve of the Pharises which is ypocrisy .
42012002	For ther is no thinge covered that shall not be vncovered : nether hyd that shall not be knowen .
42012003	For whatsoever ye have spoken in in darknes : that same shalbe hearde in light . And that which ye have spoken in the the eare eve in secret places shalbe preached even on the toppe of the housses .
42012004	I saye vnto you my fredes : Be not afrayde of them that kyll the body and after that have no moare that they can do .
42012005	But I will shewe you whom ye shall feare . Feare him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell . Ye I saye vnto you him feare .
42012006	Are not five sparowes bought for two farthinges ? And yet not one of them is forgotten of God .
42012007	Also even the very heres of youre heedes are nombred . Feare not therfore : ye are moare of value then many sparowes .
42012008	I saye vnto you : Whosoever confesseth me before men eve him shall ye sonne of man confesse also before ye angels of God .
42012009	And he that denyeth me before men : shalbe denyed before ye angels of God .
42012010	And whosoever speaketh a worde agaynst ye sonne of ma it shalbe forgeven him . But vnto him yt blasphemeth the holy goost it shall not be forgeven .
42012011	When they bringe you vnto the synagoges and vnto the rulers and officers take no thought how or what thinge ye shall answer or what ye shall speake .
42012012	For the holy goost shall teache you in the same houre what ye ought to saye .
42012013	One of the company sayde vnto hym : Master byd my brother devide the enheritauce with me .
42012014	And he sayde vnto him : Man who made me a iudge or a devider over you ?
42012015	Wherfore he sayde vnto them : take hede and beware of covetousnes . For no mannes lyfe stondeth in the aboundaunce of the thinges which he possesseth .
42012016	And he put forth a similitude vnto them sayinge : The groude of a certayne riche ma brought forth frutes plenteously
42012017	and he thought in himsilfe sayinge : what shall I do ? because I have noo roume where to bestowe my frutes ?
42012018	And he sayde : This will I do . I will destroye my barnes and bilde greater and therin will I gadder all my frutes and my goodes :
42012019	and I will saye to my soule : Soule thou hast moch goodes layde vp in stoore for many yeares take thyne ease : eate drinke and be mery .
42012020	But God sayde vnto him : Thou fole this night will they fetche awaye thy soule agayne from the . Then whose shall thoose thinges be which thou hast provyded ?
42012021	So is it with him that gadereth ryches and is not ryche in God .
42012022	And he spake vnto his disciples : Therfore I saye vnto you : take no thought for youre lyfe what ye shall eate nether for youre body what ye shall put on .
42012023	The lyfe is moare then meate and the bodye is moare then rayment .
42012024	Considre the ravens for they nether sowe nor repe which nether have stoorehousse ner barne and yet God fedeth them . How moche are ye better then the foules .
42012025	Which of you with takynge thought can adde to his stature one cubit ?
42012026	Yf ye then be not able to do that thinge which is least : why take ye thought for the remmaunt ?
42012027	Considre the lylies how they growe : They laboure not : they spyn not : and yet I saye vnto you that Salomon in all this royalte was not clothed lyke to one of these .
42012028	Yf the grasse which is todaye in the felde and tomorowe shalbe cast into the fornace God so clothe : how moche moore will he clothe you o ye endued wt litell faith ?
42012029	And axe not what ye shall eate or what ye shall drinke nether clyme ye vp an hye
42012030	for all suche thinges the hethen people of the worlde seke for . Youre father knoweth that ye have nede of suche thinges .
42012031	Wherfore seke ye after the kyngedome of God and all these thinges shalbe ministred vnto you .
42012032	Feare not litell floocke for it is youre fathers pleasure to geve you a kingdome .
42012033	Sell that ye have and geve almes . And make you bagges which wexe not olde and treasure that fayleth not in heaven where noo these commeth nether moth corrupteth .
42012034	For where youre treasure is there will youre hertes be also .
42012035	Let youre loynes be gerdde about and youre lightes brennynge
42012036	and ye youre selves lyke vnto men that wayte for their master when he will returne fro a weddinge : that assone as he cometh and knocketh they maye ope vnto him .
42012037	Happy are those servauntes which the Lorde when he cometh shall fynde wakynge . Verely I saye vnto you he will gerdde him selfe about and make them sit doune to meate and walke by and minister vnto them .
42012038	And yf he come in the seconde watche ye if he come in the thyrde watche and shall fynde them soo happy are those servauntes .
42012039	This vnderstonde that yf the good man of the housse knewe what houre ye these wolde come he wolde suerly watche : and not suffer his housse to be broken vp .
42012040	Be ye prepared therfore : for the sonne of man will come at an houre when ye thinke not .
42012041	Then Peter sayde vnto him : Master tellest thou this similitude vnto vs or to all men ?
42012042	And the Lorde sayde : If there be any faith full servaut and wise whom his Lorde shall make ruler over his housholde to geve them their duetie of meate at due season :
42012043	happy is that servaunt whom his master when he cometh shall finde soo doinge .
42012044	Of a trueth I saye vnto you : that he will make him ruler over all that he hath .
42012045	But and yf the evyll servaunt shall saye in his hert : My master wyll differre his cominge and shall beginne to smyte the servauntes and maydens and to eate and drinke and to be dronken :
42012046	the Lorde of that servaunt will come in a daye when he thinketh not and at an houre when he is not ware and will devyde him and will geve him his rewarde with the vnbelevers .
42012047	The servaut that knewe his masters will and prepared not him selfe nether dyd accordinge to his will shalbe bete with many strypes .
42012048	But he that knewe not and yet dyd committe thinges worthy of strypes shalbe beaten with feawe strypes . For vnto whom moche is geven of him shalbe moche requyred . And to whom men moche commyt the moare of him will they axe .
42012049	I am come to sende fyre on erth : and what is my dysyre but that it were all redy kyndled ?
42012050	Not with stondinge I must de baptised with a baptyme : and how am I payned till it be ended ?
42012051	Suppose ye that I am come to sende peace on erth ? I tell you naye : but rather debate .
42012052	For fro hence forthe ther shalbe five in one housse devided thre agaynst two and two agaynst thre .
42012053	The father shalbe devided agaynst the sonne and the sonne agaynst the father . The mother agaynst the doughter and the doughter agaynst the mother . The motereleawe agaynst hir doughterelawe and the doughterelawe agaynst hir motherelawe .
42012054	Then sayde he to the people : when ye se a cloude ryse out of the west strayght waye ye saye : we shall have a shower and soo it is .
42012055	And when ye se the south wynde blow ye saye : we shall have heet and it cometh to passe .
42012056	Ypocrites ye can skyll of the fassion of the erth and of the skye : but what is ye cause that ye canot skyll of this time ?
42012057	Ye and why iudge ye not of youre selves what is righte ?
42012058	Whill thou goest with thyne adversary to the ruler : as thou arte in the waye geve diligence that thou mayst be delivered fro him least he bringe the to the iudge and the iudge delyver the to the iaylar and the iaylar cast the in to preson .
42012059	I tell ye thou departest not thence tyll thou have made good ye vtmost myte .
42013001	Ther were present at the same season that shewed him of ye Galileas whose bloude Pylate mengled with their awne sacrifice .
42013002	And Iesus answered and sayde vnto them : Suppose ye that these Galileans were greater synners then all the other Galileas because they suffred suche punisshmet ?
42013003	I tell you naye : but except ye repent ye shall all in lyke wyse perysshe .
42013004	Or those . xviii . apon which ye toure in Syloe fell and slewe the thinke ye that they were synners above all men yt dwell in Ierusalem ?
42013005	I tell you naye : But excepte ye repent ye all shall lykewyse perisshe .
42013006	He put forthe this similiiude A certayne man had a fygge tree planted in his veneyarde and he came and sought frute theron and founde none .
42013007	Then sayde he to ye dresser of his vyneyarde : Beholde this thre yeare have I come and sought frute in this fygge tree and fynde none : cut it doune : why combreth it the grounde ?
42013008	And he answered and sayde vnto him : lorde let it alone this yeare also till I digge rounde aboute it and doge it to se
42013009	whether it will beare frute : and if it beare not then after yt cut it doune
42013010	And he taught in one of their sinagoges on ye saboth dayes .
42013011	And beholde ther was a woma which had a sprete of infirmite . xviii . yeares : and was bowed to gether and coulde not lifte vp hersilfe at all .
42013012	When Iesus sawe her he called her to him and sayde to her : woman thou arte delyvered from thy disease .
42013013	And he layde his hondes on her and immediatly she was made strayght and glorified God .
42013014	And the ruler of the sinagoge answered with indignacion ( be cause that Iesus had healed on the saboth daye ) and sayde vnto the people . Ther are sixe dayes in which men ought to worke : in them come and be healed and not on the saboth daye .
42013015	Then answered him the Lorde and sayd : Ypocrite doth not eache one of you on the saboth daye lowse his oxe or his asse from the stall and leade him to the water ?
42013016	And ought not this doughter of Abraham whom Sathan hath bounde loo . xviii . yeares be lowsed from this bonde on the saboth daye ?
42013017	And when he thus sayde all his adversaries were ashamed and all the people reioysed on all the excellent dedes that were done by him .
42013018	Then sayde he : What is the kyngdome of God lyke ? or wherto shall I compare it ?
42013019	It is lyke a grayne of mustard seede which a man toke and sowed in his garden : and it grewe and wexed a greate tree and the foules of the ayer made nestes in the braunches of it .
42013020	And agayne he sayde : wher vnto shall I lyken ye kyngdome of god ?
42013021	it is lyke leve which a woman toke and hidde in thre busshels of floure tyll all was thorow levended .
42013022	And he went thorow all maner of cities and tounes teachinge and iorneyinge towardes Ierusalem .
42013023	Then sayde one vnto him : Lorde are ther feawe that shalbe saved ? And he sayde vnto them :
42013024	stryve with youre selves to enter in at ye strayte gate : For many I saye vnto you will seke to enter in and shall not be able .
42013025	When the good man of ye housse is rysen vp and hath shett to the dore ye shall beginne to stonde with out and to knocke at the dore sayinge : Lorde lorde open vnto vs : and he shall answer and saye vnto you : I knowe you not whence ye are .
42013026	Then shall ye begin to saye . We have eaten in thy presence and dronke and thou hast taught in oure stretes .
42013027	And he shall saye : I tell you I knowe you not whence ye are : departe from me all ye workers of iniquite .
42013028	There shalbe wepinge and gnasshinge of teth when ye shall se Abraham and Isaac and Iacob and all the prophetes in the kyngdom of God and youre selves thrust oute at dores .
42013029	And they shall come from the eest and from the weest and from the northe and from the southe and shall syt doune in the kyngdome of God .
42013030	And beholde ther are last which shalbe fyrst : And ther are fyrst which shalbe last .
42013031	The same daye there came certayne of the pharises and sayd vnto him : Get the out of the waye and departe hence : for Herode will kyll ye .
42013032	And he sayd vnto them . Goo ye and tell that foxe beholde I cast oute devyls and heale the people to daye and to morowe and the third daye I make an ende .
42013033	Neverthelesse I must walke todaye and tomorowe and the daye folowinge : For it cannot be that a Prophet perishe eny other where save at Ierusalem .
42013034	O Ierusalem Ierusalem which kyllest prophetes and stonest them that are sent to ye : how often wolde I have gadered thy childre to gedder as the hen gathereth her nest vnder her wynges but ye wolde not .
42013035	Beholde youre habitacion shalbe left vnto you desolate . For I tell you ye shall not se me vntill the tyme come that ye shall saye blessed is he that commeth in the name of the Lorde .
42014001	And it chaunsed that he went into the housse of one of ye chefe pharises to eate breed on a saboth daye : and they watched him .
42014002	And beholde ther was a man before him which had the dropsye .
42014003	And Iesus answered and spake vnto the lawears and pharises sayinge : is it laufull to heale on the saboth daye ?
42014004	And they helde their peace . And he toke him and healed him and let him goo :
42014005	and answered the sayinge whiche of you shall have an asse or an oxe fallen into a pitt and will not strayght waye pull him out on the Saboth daye ?
42014006	And they coulde not answer him agayne to that .
42014007	He put forthe a similitude to ye gestes whe he marked how they preased to the hyest roumes and sayd vnto the :
42014008	When thou arte bidde to a weddynge of eny man syt not doune in ye hyest roume lest a more honorable man then thou be bidden of him
42014009	and he that bade bothe him and the come and saye to the : geve this man roume and thou then beginne with shame to take the lowest roume .
42014010	But rather when thou arte bidden goo and syt in the lowest roume that when he that bade the cometh he maye saye vnto the : frende syt vp hyer . Then shalt thou have worshippe in the presence of them that syt at meate with the .
42014011	For whosoever exalteth him sylfe shalbe brought lowe . And he yt hubleth him sylfe shalbe exalted
42014012	Then sayde he also to him that had desyred him to diner : When thou makest a diner or a supper : call not thy frendes nor thy brethre nether thy kinsmen nor yet ryche neghbours : lest they bidde the agayne and a recompence be made the .
42014013	But when thou makest afeast call the poore the maymed the lame and the blynde
42014014	and thou shalt be happy for they cannot recompence the . But thou shalt be recompensed at the resurreccion of the iuste men .
42014015	When one of them that sate at meate also hearde that he sayde vnto him : happy is he that eateth breed in the kyngdome of God .
42014016	Then sayd he to him . A certayne man ordened a greate supper and bade many
42014017	and sent his servaunt at supper tyme to saye to them that wer bidden come : for all thinges are now redy .
42014018	And they all atonce begane to make excuse . The fyrst sayd vnto him : I have bought a ferme and I must nedes goo and se it I praye the have me excused .
42014019	And another sayd : I hove bought fyve yooke of oxen and I goo to prove them I praye the have me excused .
42014020	The thyrde sayd : I have maried a wyfe and therfore I cannot come .
42014021	And the servaunt went and brought his master worde therof . Then was the good man of the housse displeased and sayd to his servaut : Goo out quickly into ye stretes and quarters of the cite and bringe in hidder the poore and the maymed and the halt and the blynde .
42014022	And the servaut sayd : lorde it is done as thou comaundedst and yet ther is roume .
42014023	And the lorde sayd to the servaunt : Go out into ye hye wayes and hedges and compell the to come in that my housse maye be filled .
42014024	For I saye vnto you that none of those men which were bidde shall tast of my supper .
42014025	Ther went agreate copany with him and he turned and sayde vnto them :
42014026	If a man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wyfe and chyldren and brethren and sisters more over and his awne lyfe he cannot be my disciple .
42014027	And whosoever beare not his crosse and come after me cannot be my disciple .
42014028	Which of you disposed to bilde a toure sytteth not doune before and counteth ye cost whether he have sufficient to performe it ?
42014029	lest after he hath layde ye foundacion and is not able to performe it all yt beholde it beginne to mocke him
42014030	sayinge : this man beganne to bilde and was not able to make an ende .
42014031	Or what kynge goeth to make batayle agaynst another kinge and sitteth not doune fyrst and casteth in his mynde whether he be able wt ten thousande to mete him that cometh agaynst him wt . xx thousand .
42014032	Or els whyll ye other is yet a greate waye of he will sende embasseatours and desyre peace .
42014033	So lykewyse none of you yt forsaketh not all yt he hath can be my disciple .
42014034	Salt is good but yf salt have loste hyr saltnes what shall be seasoned ther with ?
42014035	It is nether good for ye londe nor yet for ye donge hill but men cast it out at ye dores . He yt hath eares to heare let him heare .
42015001	Then resorted vnto him all ye publicas and synners for to heare him .
42015002	And the pharises and scribes murmured sayinge : He receaved to his copany synners and eateth with them .
42015003	Then put he forthe this similitude to the sayinge :
42015004	What man of you havynge an hundred shepe yf he loose one of thee doth not leve nynty and nyne in the wyldernes and goo after yt which is loost vntyll he fynde him ?
42015005	And whe he hath founde him he putteth him on his shulders with ioye :
42015006	And assone as he cometh home he calleth to gedder his lovers and neghbours sayinge vnto them : reioyse with me for I have founde my shepe which was loost .
42015007	I say vnto you yt lyke wyse ioye shalbe in heven over one synner yt repenteth moore then over nynety and nyne iuste persons whiche nede noo repentauce .
42015008	Ether what woman havynge . x . grotes yf she loose one doth not lyght a candell and swepe ye housse and seke diligently tyll she fynde it ?
42015009	And when she hath founde it she calleth her lovers and her neghbours sayinge : Reioyce wt me for I have founde the groate which I had loost .
42015010	Lykwyse I saye vnto you ioye is made in ye presence of ye angels of god over one synner yt repenteth .
42015011	And he sayde : a certayne man had two sonnes
42015012	and the yonger of them sayde to his father : father geve me my parte of the goodes yt to me belongeth . And he devided vnto them his substaunce .
42015013	And not longe after ye yonger sonne gaddered all that he had to gedder and toke his iorney into a farre countre and theare he wasted his goodes with royetous lyvinge .
42015014	And when he had spent all that he had ther rose a greate derth thorow out all yt same londe and he began to lacke .
42015015	And he went and clave to a citesyn of yt same countre which sent him to his felde to kepe his swyne .
42015016	And he wold fayne have filled his bely with the coddes that ye swyne ate : and noo man gave him .
42015017	Then he came to him selfe and sayde : how many hyred servauntes at my fathers have breed ynough and I dye for honger .
42015018	I will aryse and goo to my father and will saye vnto him : father I have synned agaynst heven and before ye
42015019	and am no moare worthy to be called thy sonne make me as one of thy hyred servauntes .
42015020	And he arose and went to his father . And when he was yet a greate waye of his father sawe him and had compassion and ran and fell on his necke and kyssed him .
42015021	And the sonne sayd vnto him : father I have synned agaynst heven and in thy sight and am no moare worthy to be called thy sonne .
42015022	But his father sayde to his servautes : bringe forth that best garment and put it on him and put a rynge on his honde and showes on his fete .
42015023	And bringe hidder that fatted caulfe and kyll him and let vs eate and be mery :
42015024	for this my sonne was deed and is alyve agayne he was loste and is now founde . And they began to be merye .
42015025	The elder brother was in the felde and when he cam and drewe nye to ye housse he herde minstrelcy and daunsynge
42015026	and called one of his servauntes and axed what thoose thinges meate .
42015027	And he sayd vnto him : thy brother is come and thy father had kylled ye fatted caulfe because he hath receaved him safe and sounde .
42015028	And he was angry and wolde not goo in . Then came his father out and entreated him .
42015029	He answered and sayde to his father : Loo these many yeares have I done the service nether brake at eny tyme thy commaundment and yet gavest thou me never soo moche as a kyd to make mery wt my lovers :
42015030	but assone as this thy sonne was come which hath devoured thy goodes with harlootes thou haste for his pleasure kylled ye fatted caulfe .
42015031	And he sayd vnto him : Sonne thou wast ever with me and all that I have is thyne :
42015032	it was mete that we shuld make mery and be glad : for this thy brother was deed and is a lyve agayne : and was loste and is founde .
42016001	And he sayd also vnto his disciples . Ther was a certayne rych man which had a stewarde that was acused vnto him that he had wasted his goodes .
42016002	And he called him and sayd vnto him : How is it that I heare this of the ? Geve a comptes of thy steward shippe : For thou mayste be no longer stewarde .
42016003	The stewarde sayd wt in him selfe : what shall I do ? for my master will take awaye fro me ye stewarde shippe . I canot digge and to begge I am ashamed .
42016004	I woote what to do yt when I am put out of ye stewardshippe they maye receave me into their houses .
42016005	Then called he all his masters detters and sayd vnto ye fyrst : how moche owest thou vnto my master ?
42016006	And he sayd : an hondred tonnes of oyle . And he sayd to him : take thy bill and syt doune quickly and wryte fiftie .
42016007	Then sayd he to another : what owest thou ? And he sayde : an hondred quarters of wheate . He sayd to him : Take thy bill and write foure scoore .
42016008	And the lorde comended the vniust stewarde because he had done wysly . For ye chyldren of this worlde are in their kynde wyser then ye chyldren of lyght .
42016009	And I saye also vnto you : make you frendes of the wicked mammon that when ye shall departe they may receave you into everlastinge habitacions .
42016010	He that is faithfull in that which is leste ye same is faithfull in moche . And he yt is vnfaithfull in ye least : is vnfaithfull also in moche .
42016011	So then yf ye have not ben faithfull in ye wicked mamon ? who will beleve you in that which is true ?
42016012	And yf ye have not bene faithfull in another manes busines : who shall geve you youre awne ?
42016013	No servaunt can serve . ii . masters for other he shall hate ye one and love ye other or els he shall lene to the one and despyse the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon .
42016014	All these thinges herde the pharises also which were coveteous and they mocked him .
42016015	And he sayd vnto the : Ye are they which iustifie youre selves before me : but God knoweth youre hertes . For ye which is highlie estemed amoge me is abhominable in yt sight of god
42016016	The lawe and the Prophetes raygned vntyll the tyme of Iohn : and sence that tyme the kyngdom of God is preached and every man stryveth to goo in .
42016017	Soner shall heven and erth perisshe then one tytle of the lawe shall perisshe .
42016018	Whosoever forsaketh his wyfe and marieth another breaketh matrimony . And every man which marieth her that is devorsed from her husbande committeth advoutry also .
42016019	Ther was a certayne ryche man which was clothed in purple and fyne bysse and fared deliciously every daye .
42016020	And ther was a certayne begger named Lazarus whiche laye at his gate full of soores
42016021	desyringe to be refresshed with the cromes whiche fell from the ryche manes borde . Neverthelesse the dogges came and licked his soores .
42016022	And yt fortuned that the begger dyed and was caried by the angelles into Abrahas bosome . The riche man also died and was buried .
42016023	And beinge in hell in tormetes he lyfte vp his eyes and sawe Abraham a farre of and Lazarus in his bosome
42016024	and he cryed and sayd : father Abraham have mercy on me and sende Lazarus that he maye dippe the tippe of his fynger in water and cole my tonge : for I am tourmented in this flame .
42016025	But Abraha sayd vnto him Sonne remembre that thou in thy lyfe tyme receavedst thy pleasure and contrary wyse Lazarus payne . Now therfore is he comforted and thou art punysshed .
42016026	Beyonde all this bitwene you and vs ther is a greate space set so that they which wolde goo from thence to you cannot : nether maye come from thence to vs .
42016027	Then he sayd : I praye the therfore father send him to my fathers housse .
42016028	For I have fyve brethren : for to warne the left they also come into this place of tourmet .
42016029	Abraha sayd vnto him : they have Moses and the Prophetes let them heare them .
42016030	And he sayd : naye father Abraham but yf one came vnto the from the ded they wolde repent .
42016031	He sayd vnto him : If they heare not Moses and ye prophetes nether will they beleve though one roose from deeth agayne .
42017001	Then sayde he to ye disciples it can not be avoyded but that offences will come . Neverthelesse wo be to him thorow whom they come .
42017002	It were better for him that a mylstone were hanged aboute his necke and that he were cast into ye see then that he shuld offende one of this lytleons .
42017003	Take hede to youre selves . If thy brother trespas agaynst the rebuke him :
42017004	and yf he repent forgeve him . And though he sinne agest ye . vii . tymes in a daye and seve tymes in a daye tourne agayne to ye sayinge : it repenteth me forgeve him
42017005	And the apostles sayde vnto the Lorde : increase oure faith .
42017006	And the Lorde sayde : yf ye had faith lyke a grayne of mustard sede and shuld saye vnto this sycamine tree plucke thy selfe vp by the rootes and plant thy selfe in the see : he should obey you .
42017007	Who is it of you yf he had a servaute plowinge or fedinge catell that wolde saye vnto him when he were come from the felde Goo quickly and syt doune to meate :
42017008	and wolde not rather saye to him dresse wherwith I maye sup and gyrde vp thy selfe and serve me tyll I have eaten and dronken : and afterwarde eate thou and drinke thou ?
42017009	Doeth he thanke that servaunt because he dyd that which was commaunded vnto him ? I trowe not .
42017010	Soo lyke wyse ye when ye have done all thoose thinges which are commaunded you : saye we are vnprofitable servautes . We have done : ye which was oure duetye to do .
42017011	And it chaunsed as he went to Ierusalem that he passed thorow Samaria and Galile .
42017012	And as he entred into a certayne toune ther met him ten men yt were lepers . Which stode a farre of
42017013	and put forth their voyces and sayde : Iesu master have mercy on vs .
42017014	When he sawe the he sayde vnto them : Goo and shewe youre selves to the prestes . And it chaunsed as they went they were clensed .
42017015	And one of them when he sawe that he was clensed turned backe agayne and with a loude voyce praysed God
42017016	and fell doune on his face at his fete and gave him thankes . And the same was a Samaritane .
42017017	And Iesus answered and sayde : are ther not ten clensed ? But where are those nyne ?
42017018	Ther are not founde that returned agane to geve God prayse save only this straunger .
42017019	And he sayde vnto him : aryse and goo thy waye thy faith hath made the whoale .
42017020	When he was demaunded of ye pharises when the kyngdome of God shuld come : he answered them and sayde : The kyngdome of God cometh not with waytinge for .
42017021	Nether shall men saye : Loo here loo there . For beholde the kyngdome of God is with in you .
42017022	And he sayde vnto the disciples : The dayes will come when ye shall desyre to se one daye of the sonne of man and ye shall not se it .
42017023	And they shall saye to you : Se here Se there . Goo not after them nor folowe them
42017024	for as the lyghtenynge that apereth out of the one parte of the heven and shyneth vnto the other parte of heven : Soo shall the sonne of man be in his dayes .
42017025	But fyrst must he suffre many thinges and be refused of this nacion .
42017026	As it happened in ye tyme of Noe : So shall it be in the tyme of the sonne of man .
42017027	They ate they dranke they maryed wyves and were maryed even vnto yt same daye yt Noe went into ye arke : and ye floud cam and destroyed the all .
42017028	Lykewyse also as it chaunsed in the dayes of Lot . They ate they dranke they bought they solde they planted they bilte .
42017029	And even the same daye that Lot went out of Zodom it rayned fyre and brymstone from heven and destroyed them all .
42017030	After these ensamples shall it be in the daye when the sonne of man shall appere .
42017031	At that daye he that is on the housse toppe and his stuffe in the housse : let him not come doune to take it out . And lykewyse let not him that is in the feldes turne backe agayne to that he lefte behynde .
42017032	Remember Lottes wyfe .
42017033	Whosoever will goo about to save his lyfe shall loose it : And whosoever shall loose his lyfe shall save it .
42017034	I tell you : In that nyght ther shalbe two in one beed the one shalbe receaved and the other shalbe forsaken .
42017035	Two shalbe also a grindynge to gedder : the one shalbe receaved and the other forsaken .
42017036	And they answered and sayde to him : wheare Lorde ? And he sayd vnto the : whersoever ye body shalbe thyther will the egles resoorte .
42017037	And they answered and sayde to him : wheare Lorde ? And he sayd vnto the : whersoever ye body shalbe thyther will the egles resoorte .
42018001	And he put forth a similitude vnto the signifyinge that men ought alwayes to praye and not to be wery
42018002	sayinge : Ther was a Iudge in a certayne cite which feared not god nether regarded man .
42018003	And ther was a certayne wedowe in the same cite which came vnto him sayinge : avenge me of myne adversary .
42018004	And he wolde not for a whyle . But afterwarde he sayd vnto him selfe : though I feare not God nor care for man
42018005	yet because this wedowe troubleth me I will avenge her lest at the laste she come and hagge on me .
42018006	And the lorde sayd : heare what the vnrightewes Iudge sayeth .
42018007	And shall not god avenge his electe which crye daye and nyght vnto him ye though he differre them ?
42018008	I tell you he will avenge them and that quickly . Neverthelesse when the sonne of man cometh suppose ye that he shall fynde faithe on the erthe .
42018009	And he put forthe this similitude vnto certayne which trusted in the selves yt they were perfecte and despysed other .
42018010	Two men went vp into ye teple to praye : ye one a pharise and the other a publican .
42018011	The pharise stode and prayed thus wt him selfe . God I thanke the yt I am not as other men are extorsioners vniuste advoutrers or as this publican .
42018012	I fast twyse in ye weke . I geve tythe of all that I possesse .
42018013	And the publican stode afarre of and wolde not lyfte vp his eyes to heven but smote his brest sayinge : God be mercyfull to me a synner .
42018014	I tell you : this ma departed hoe to his housse iustified moore then the other . For every man that exalteth him selfe shalbe brought low : And he yt hubleth him selfe shalbe exalted
42018015	They brought vnto him also babes yt he shuld touche the . When his disciples sawe that they rebuked the .
42018016	But Iesus called the vnto him and sayde : Suffre chyldren to come vnto me and forbidde the not . For of soche is ye kyngdome of God .
42018017	Verely I saye vnto you : whosoever receaveth not the kyngdome of God as a chylde : he shall not enter therin .
42018018	And a certayne ruler axed him sayinge : Good Master : what ought I to do to obtayne eternall lyfe ?
42018019	Iesus sayd vnto him : Why callest thou me good ? No man is good save God only .
42018020	Thou knowest ye comaundmentes : Thou shalt not commit advoutry : thou shalt not kyll : thou shalt not steale : thou shalt not beare false witnes : Honoure thy father and thy mother .
42018021	And he sayde : all these have I kept from my youthe .
42018022	When Iesus hearde that he sayde vnto him : Yet lackest thou one thinge . Sell all that thou hast and distribute it vnto the poore and thou shalt have treasure in heven and come and folowe me .
42018023	When he heard that he was hevy : for he was very ryche .
42018024	When Iesus sawe him morne he sayde : with what difficulte shall they that have ryches enter into the kyngdome of God :
42018025	it is easyer for a camell to goo thorow a nedles eye then for a ryche man to enter into the kyngdome of God .
42018026	Then sayde they that hearde that : And who shall then be saved ?
42018027	And he sayde : Thinges which are vnpossible with men are possible with God .
42018028	Then Peter sayde : Loo we have lefte all and have folowed the .
42018029	And he sayde vnto them : Verely I saye vnto you ther is noo man that leaveth housse other father and mother other brethren or wyfe or chyldren for the kyngdome of Goddes sake
42018030	which same shall not receave moche moore in this worlde : and in the worlde to come lyfe everlastinge .
42018031	He toke vnto him twelve and sayde vnto them . Beholde we go vp to Ierusalem and all shalbe fulfilled that are written by ye Prophetes of the sonne of man .
42018032	He shalbe delivered vnto the gentils and shalbe mocked and shalbe despytfully entreated and shalbe spetted on :
42018033	and when they have scourged him they will put him to deeth and the thyrde daye he shall aryse agayne .
42018034	But they vnderstode none of these thinges . And this sayinge was hid fro them . And they perceaved not the thinges which were spoken .
42018035	And it came to passe as he was come nye vnto Hierico a certayne blynde man sate by the waye syde begginge .
42018036	And when he hearde the people passe by he axed what it meant .
42018037	And they sayde vnto him yt Iesus of Nazareth passed by .
42018038	And he cryed sayinge : Iesus ye sonne of David have thou mercy on me .
42018039	And they which went before rebuked him that he shuld holde his peace . But he cryed so moche the moare thou sonne of David have mercy on me .
42018040	And Iesus stode styll and commaunded him to be brought vnto him . And when he was come neare he axed him
42018041	sayinge : What wilt thou that I do vnto the ? And he sayde : Lorde yt I maye receave my sight .
42018042	Iesus sayde vnto him : receave thy sight : thy faith hath saved the .
42018043	And immediatly he sawe and folowed him praysinge God . And all the people when they sawe it gave laude to God .
42019001	And he entred in and went thorow Hierico .
42019002	And beholde ther was a ma named Zacheus which was a ruler amoge the Publicans and was riche also .
42019003	And he made meanes to se Iesus what he shuld be : and coulde not for the preace because he was of a lowe stature .
42019004	Wherfore he ran before and asceded vp into a wilde fygge tree to se him : for he shulde come that same waye .
42019005	And when Iesus cam to the place he loked vp and sawe him and sayd vnto him : zache attonce come doune for to daye I must abyde at thy housse .
42019006	And he came doune hastelye and receaved him ioyfully .
42019007	And when they sawe that they all groudged sayinge : He is gone in to tary with a man that is a synner .
42019008	And zache stode forth and sayd vnto ye Lorde : beholde Lorde ye haulfe of my gooddes I geve to the povre and if I have done eny ma wroge I will restore him fower folde .
42019009	And Iesus sayd to him : this daye is healthe come vnto this housse for as moche as it also is become the chylde of Abraha .
42019010	For the sonne of ma is come to seke and to save that which was looste .
42019011	As they hearde these thinges he added ther to a similitude be cause he was nye to Hierusalem and because also they thought that the kyngdome of God shuld shortely appere .
42019012	He sayde therfore : a certayne noble man wet into a farre countre to receave him a kyngdome and then to come agayne .
42019013	And he called his ten servauntes and delyvered them ten pounde sayinge vnto them : by and sell till I come .
42019014	But his citesens hated him and sent messengers after him sayinge : We will not have this man to raygne over vs .
42019015	And it came to passe when he was come agayne and had receaved his kyngdome he comaunded these servautes to be called to him ( to whom he gave his money ) to witt what every man had done .
42019016	Then came ye fyrst sayinge : Lorde thy pounde hath encreased ten poude .
42019017	And he sayde vnto him : Well good servaute because thou wast faithfull in a very lytell thynge take thou auctorite over ten cities .
42019018	And the other came sayinge : Lorde thy poude hath encreased fyve pounde .
42019019	And to ye same he sayde : and be thou also ruler ouer fyve cities .
42019020	And the thyrde came and sayde : Lorde beholde here thy pounde which I have kepte in a napkyn
42019021	for I feared the because thou arte a strayte man : thou takest vp that thou laydest not doune and repest that thou dyddest not sowe .
42019022	And he sayde vnto him : Of thine awne mouth iudge I the thou evyll servaunt . knewest thou that I am a strayte man takinge vp that I layde not doune and repinge that I dyd not sowe ?
42019023	Wherfore then gavest not thou my money into the banke that at my cominge I might have required myne awne with vauntage ?
42019024	And he sayde to them that stode by : take fro him that pounde and geve it him that hath ten poude .
42019025	And they sayd vnto him : Lorde he hath ten pounde .
42019026	I saye vnto you that vnto all the that have it shalbe geve : and from him yt hath not eve that he hath shalbe taken from him .
42019027	Moreover those myne enemys which wolde not that I shuld raigne over them bringe hidder and slee them before me .
42019028	And when he had thus spoken he proceded forthe before a ssendinge vp to Ierusalem .
42019029	And it fortuned when he was come nye to Bethphage and Bethany besydes moute olivete he sent two of his disciples
42019030	sayinge : Goo ye in to the toune which is over agaynste you . In the which assone as ye are come ye shall finde a colte tyed wheron yet never man sate . Lowse him and bringe him hider .
42019031	And if eny man axe you why that ye loowse him : thus saye vnto him ye lorde hath nede of him .
42019032	They that were sent went their waye and founde eve as he had sayde vnto the .
42019033	And as they were aloosinge ye coolte the owners sayde vnto the : why lowse ye ye coolte ?
42019034	And they sayde : for ye Lorde hath nede of him .
42019035	And they brought him to Iesus . And they cast their raymet on ye colte and set Iesus thero .
42019036	And as he wet they spredde their clothes in ye waye .
42019037	And when he was now come wheare he shuld goo doune fro the moute olivete ye whole multitude of ye disciples began to reioyce and to lawde God with a loude voyce for all ye miracles yt they had sene
42019038	sayinge : Blessed be the kynge that cometh in the name of the Lorde : peace in heave and glory in the hyest .
42019039	And some of ye Pharises of the copany sayde vnto him : Master rebuke thy disciples .
42019040	He answered and sayde vnto the : I tell you yf these shuld holde their peace the stones wold crye .
42019041	And when he was come neare he behelde the citie and wept on it
42019042	sayinge : Yf thou haddest dest knowen those thinges which belonge vn thy peace eve at this thy tyme . But now are they hydde from thyne eyes .
42019043	For the dayes shall come vpo the that thy enemys shall cast a banke aboute the and copasse the rounde and kepe the in on every syde
42019044	and make the even with the grounde with thy chyldren which are in the . And they shall not leve in the one stone vpo another because thou knewest not the tyme of thy visitacion .
42019045	And he went in to the temple and begane to cast out them that solde therin and them that bought
42019046	sayinge vnto them yt is written : my housse is the housse of prayer : but ye have made it a den of theves .
42019047	And he taught dayly in the temple . The hye Prestes and the Scribes and the chefe of the people went about to destroye him :
42019048	but coulde not finde what to do . For all the people stacke by him and gave him audience .
42020001	And yt fortuned in one of those dayes as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospell : the hye prestes and the scribes came with the elders
42020002	and spake vnto him sayinge . Tell vs by what auctorite thou doest these thinges ? Ether who is he yt gave ye this auctorite ?
42020003	He answered and saide vnto the : I also will axe you a questio and answer me .
42020004	The baptyme of Iohn : was it from heaven or of men ?
42020005	And they thought with in them selves sayinge : yf we shall saye from heave : he will saye : why then beleved ye him not ?
42020006	But and yf we shall saye of men all ye people will stone vs . For they be persuaded that Ihon is a Prophet .
42020007	And they answered that they coulde not tell whence it was .
42020008	And Iesus sayde vnto them : nether tell I you by what auctorite I do these thinges .
42020009	Then begane he to put forthe to the people this similitude . A certayne man planted a vyneyarde and let it forthe to fermers and went him selfe into a straunge countre for a greate season .
42020010	And when the tyme was come he sent a servaut to his tennauntes that they shuld geve him of the frutes of the vyneyarde . And the tennauntes dyd bet him and sent him awaye empty .
42020011	And agayne he sent yet another servaunt . And they dyd bet him and foule entreated him also and sent him awaye emptye .
42020012	Moreover he sent the thyrde to and him they wouded and cast out .
42020013	Then sayde the lorde of the vyneyarde : what shall I do ? I will sende my deare sonne him peradventure they will reverence when they se him .
42020014	But when the fermers sawe him they thought in them selves sayinge : this is the heyre come let vs kyll him that the inheritaunce maye be oures .
42020015	And they cast him out of the vyneyarde and kylled him . Now what shall the Lorde of the vyneyarde do vnto them ?
42020016	He will come and destroye those fermers and will let out his vyneyarde to other . When they hearde that they sayde : God forbyd .
42020017	And he behelde them and sayde : what meaneth this then yt is wrytten : The stone that the bylders refused the same is made ye heed corner stone ?
42020018	whosoever stomble at that stone shalbe broken : but on whosoever it faul vpon it wyll grynde him to powder .
42020019	And the hye Prestes and the Scribes the same howre went about to laye hondes on him but they feared the people . For they perceaved that he had spoken this similitude agaynst them .
42020020	And they watched him and sent forth spies which shuld fayne them selves perfecte to take him in his wordes and to delyvre him vnto the power and auctorite of the debite .
42020021	And they axed him sayinge : Master we knowe that thou sayest and teachest ryght nother cosiderest thou eny manes degre but teachest the waye of God truly .
42020022	Ys it laufull for vs to geve Cesar tribute or no ?
42020023	He perceaved their craftynes and sayde vnto them : why tept ye me ?
42020024	Shewe me a peny . Whose ymage and superscripcio hath it ? They answered and sayde : Cesars .
42020025	And he sayde vnto them : Geve then vnto Cesar that which belongeth vnto Cesar : and to God that which pertayneth to God .
42020026	And they coulde not reprove his sayinge before the people . But they marvayled at his answer and helde their peace .
42020027	Then came to him certayne of the Saduces which denye that ther is eny resurreccio . And they axed him
42020028	sayinge : Master Moses wrote vnto vs if eny mannes brother dye havinge a wyfe and the same dye with out yssue : that then his brother shuld take his wyfe and reyse vp seede vnto his brother .
42020029	Ther were seven brethren and the fyrste toke a wyfe and dyed with out children .
42020030	And the seconde toke the wyfe and he dyed chyldlesse .
42020031	And the thyrde toke her and in lyke wyse the resydue of the seven and leeft no chyldren be hynde them and dyed .
42020032	Last of all the woma dyed also .
42020033	Now at the resurreccio whose wyfe of them shall she be ? For seven had her to wyfe .
42020034	Iesus answered and sayde vnto them . The chyldre of this worlde mary wyves and are maryed
42020035	but they which shalbe made worthy to enioye that worlde and the resurreccion from deeth nether mary wyves nether are maryed
42020036	nor yet can dye eny moare . For they are equall vnto the angels : and are the sonnes of God in as moche as they are the chyldre of the resurreccion .
42020037	And that the deed shall ryse agayne even Moses signified besydes the busshe when he sayde : the Lorde God of Adraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Iacob .
42020038	For he is not the God of the deed but of them which live . For all live in him .
42020039	Then certayne of the Pharises answered and sayde : Master thou hast well sayde .
42020040	And after that durst they not axe him eny question at all .
42020041	Then sayde he vnto them : how saye they that Christ is Davids sonne ?
42020042	And David him selfe sayth in the boke of the Psalmes : The Lorde sayde vnto my Lorde syt on my right honde
42020043	tyll I make thine enemys thy fothe stole .
42020044	Seinge David calleth him Lorde : How is he then his sonne .
42020045	Then in the audience of all the people he sayde vnto his disciples
42020046	beware of the Scribes which desyre to goo in longe clothinge : and love gretynges in the markets and the hyest seates in the synagoges and chefe roumes at feastes
42020047	which devoure widdowes houses and that vnder a coloure of longe prayinge : the same shall receave greater damnacion .
42021001	As he behelde he sawe the ryche men how they cast in their offeringes into the treasury .
42021002	And he sawe also a certayne povre widdowe which cast in thyther two mites .
42021003	And he sayde : of a trueth I saye vnto you this poore wyddowe hath put in moare then they all .
42021004	For they all have of their superfluyte added vnto the offerynge of God : but she of her penury hath cast in all the substaunce that she had .
42021005	As some spake of the teple how it was garnesshed with goodly stones and iewels he sayde .
42021006	The dayes will come whe of these thynges which ye se shall not be lefte stone apon stone that shall not be throwen doune .
42021007	And they axed him sayinge : Master whe shall these thinges be and what signe will therbe whe suche thinges shall come to passe .
42021008	And he sayd : take hede that ye be not deceaved . For many will come in my name saying : I am he : and the tyme draweth neare . Folowe ye not them therfore .
42021009	But when ye heare of warre and of dissencion : be not afrayd . For these thinges must fyrst come : but the ende foloweth not by and by .
42021010	Then sayd he vnto the : Nacion shall ryse agaynst nacion and kingdom agaynst kyngdome
42021011	and greate erthquakes shall be in all quarters and honger and pestilence : and fearfull thinges . And greate signes shall therbe from heven .
42021012	But before all these they shall laye their hondes on you and persecute you delyueringe you vp to the sinagoges and into preson and bringe you before kynges and rulers for my names sake .
42021013	And this shall chaunce you for a testimoniall .
42021014	Let it sticke therfore faste in youre hertes not once to stody before what ye shall answere :
42021015	for I will geve you a mouth and wisdome where agaynste all youre adversarys shall not be able to speake nor resist .
42021016	Ye and ye shalbe betrayed of youre fathers and mothers and of youre brethren and kynsmen and lovers aud some of you shall they put to deeth .
42021017	And hated shall ye be of all men for my names sake .
42021018	Yet ther shall not one heer of youre heedes perisshe .
42021019	With youre pacience possesse youre soules .
42021020	And when ye se Ierusalem beseged with an hoste then vnderstonde that the desolacio of the same is nye .
42021021	Then let them which are in Iewrye flye to the mountaynes . And let them which are in the middes of it departe oute . And let not them that are in other countreis enter ther in .
42021022	For these be the dayes of vengeance to fulfill all that are writte .
42021023	But wo be to them that be with chylde and to them that geve sucke in those dayes : for ther shalbe greate trouble in the londe and wrath over all this people .
42021024	And they shall fall on the edge of the swearde and shalbe leed captive into all nacions . And Ierusalem shalbe trooden vnder fote of the gentyls vntyll the tyme of the gentyls be fulfilled .
42021025	And ther shalbe signes in the sunne ad in the mone and in the starres : and in ye erth the people shalbe in soche perplexite yt they shall not tell which waye to turne them selves . The see and the waters shall roore
42021026	and menes hertes shall fayle them for feare and for lokinge after thoose thinges which shall come on the erth . For the powers of heve shall move .
42021027	And then shall they se the sonne of ma come in a clowde with power and greate glory .
42021028	When these thinges begyn to come to passe : then loke vp and lifte vp youre heddes for youre redemcion draweth neye .
42021029	And he shewed the a similitude : beholde ye fygge tree and all other trees
42021030	when they shute forth their buddes ye se and knowe of youre awne selves that sommer is then nye at hod .
42021031	So lyke wyse ye ( when ye se these thinges come to passe ) vnderstonde that the kyngdome of God is neye .
42021032	Verely I saye vnto you : this generacion shall not passe tyll all be fulfilled .
42021033	Heaven and erth shall passe : but my wordes shall not passe .
42021034	Take hede to youre selves lest youre hertes be overcome with surfettinge and dronkennes and cares of this worlde : and that that daye come on you vnwares .
42021035	For as a snare shall it come on all them that sit on the face of the erthe .
42021036	Watche therfore continually and praye that ye maye obtayne grace to flye all this that shall come and that ye maye stonde before the sonne of man .
42021037	In the daye tyme he taught in the temple and at night he went out and had abydinge in the mount olivete .
42021038	And all the people came in the morninge to him in the temple for to heare him .
42022001	The feaste of swete breed drue nye whiche is called ester
42022002	and the hye prestes and Scribes sought how to kyll him but they feared the people .
42022003	Then entred Satan into Iudas whose syr name was Iscariot ( which was of the nombre of the twelve )
42022004	and he went his waye and comuned with the hye Prestes and officers how he might betraye him to them .
42022005	And they were glad : and promysed to geve him money .
42022006	And he consented and sought oportunite to betraye him vnto them when the people were awaye .
42022007	Then came ye daye of swete breed when of necessite the esterlambe must be offered .
42022008	And he sent Peter and Iohn sayinge : Goo and prepare vs the ester lambe that we maye eate .
42022009	They sayde to him . Where wilt thou yt we prepare ?
42022010	And he sayd vnto them . Beholde when ye be entred into the cite ther shall a man mete you bearinge a pitcher of water him folowe into the same housse yt he entreth in
42022011	and saye vnto ye good ma of ye housse . The master sayeth vnto ye : where is ye gest chamber where I shall eate myne ester lambe wt my disciples ?
42022012	And he shall shew you a greate parloure paved . Ther make redy .
42022013	And they wet and foude as he had sayd vnto the : and made redy ye ester lambe .
42022014	And when the houre was come he sate doune and the twelve Apostles with him .
42022015	And he sayde vnto them : I have inwardly desyred to eate this ester lambe with you before yt I suffre .
42022016	For I saye vnto you : hence forthe I will not eate of it eny moore vntill it be fulfilled in the kingdome of God .
42022017	And he toke the cup and gave thankes and sayde . Take this and devyde it amonge you .
42022018	For I saye vnto you : I will not drinke of the frute of the vyne vntill the kingdome of God be come .
42022019	And he toke breed gave thankes and gave to them sayinge : This is my body which is geven for you . This do in the remembraunce of me .
42022020	Lykewyse also when they had supped he toke the cup sayinge : This cup is the newe testament in my bloud which shall for you be shedde .
42022021	Yet beholde the honde of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table .
42022022	And ye sonne of man goeth as it is appoynted : But wo be to yt man by whom he is betrayed .
42022023	And they began to enquyre amoge them selves which of them it shuld be that shuld do that .
42022024	And ther was a stryfe amoge the which of them shuld be taken for the greatest .
42022025	And he sayde vnto them : the kynges of the getyls raygne over them and they that beare rule over them are called gracious lordes .
42022026	But ye shall not be so . But he that is greatest amonge you shalbe as the yongest : and he that is chefe shalbe as the minister .
42022027	For whether is greater he that sitteth at meate : or he that serveth ? Is not he that sitteth at meate ? And I am amoge you as he that ministreth .
42022028	Ye are they which have bidden with me in my temptacions .
42022029	And I apoynt vnto you a kyngdome as my father hath appoynted to me :
42022030	that ye maye eate and drynke at my table in my kyngdome and sit on seates and iudge the twelve tribes of Israell .
42022031	And the Lorde sayde : Simon Simon beholde Satan hath desired you to sifte you as it were wheate :
42022032	bnt I have prayed for the that thy faith fayle not . And when thou arte converted strengthe thy brethre .
42022033	And he sayd vnto him . Lorde I am redy to go with the in to preson and to deth .
42022034	And he sayde : I tell the Peter the cocke shall not crowe this daye tyll thou have thryse denyed yt thou knewest me .
42022035	And he sayde vnto them : when I sent you with out wallet and scripe and shoes ? lacked ye eny thinge ? And they sayd no .
42022036	And he sayde to them : but nowe he that hath a wallet let him take it vp and lykewyse his scrippe . And he that hath no swearde let him sell his coote and bye one .
42022037	For I saye vnto you that yet that which is written must be performed in me : even with the wycked was he nombred . For those thinges which are written of me have an ende .
42022038	And they sayde : Lorde beholde here are two sweardes . And he sayde vnto them : it is ynough .
42022039	And he came out and went as he was wote to mounte olivete . And the disciples folowed him .
42022040	And when he came to the place he sayde to the : praye lest ye fall into temptacio .
42022041	And he gate him selfe from them about a stones cast and kneled doune and prayed
42022042	sayinge : Father yf thou wilt withdrawe this cup fro me . Neverthelesse not my will but thyne be be fulfilled .
42022043	And ther appered an angell vnto him from heaven confortinge him .
42022044	And he was in an agonye and prayed somwhat longer . And hys sweate was lyke droppes of bloud tricklynge doune to the grounde .
42022045	And he rose vp from prayer and came to his disciples and foude them slepinge for sorowe
42022046	and sayde vnto them : Why slepe ye ? Ryse and praye lest ye fall into temptacion .
42022047	Whill he yet spake : beholde ther came a company and he that was called Iudas one of the twelve wet before them and preased nye vnto Iesus to kysse him .
42022048	And Iesus sayd vnto him : Iudas betrayest thou ye sonne of man with a kysse ?
42022049	When they which were about him sawe what wolde folow they sayde vnto him . Lorde shall we smite with swearde .
42022050	And one of them smote a servaut of ye hiest preste of all and smote of his right eare .
42022051	And Iesus answered and sayd : Soffre ye thus farre forthe . And he touched his eare and healed him .
42022052	Then Iesus sayde vnto the hye prestes and rulers of the temple and the elders which were come to him . Be ye come out as vnto a thefe with sweardes and staves ?
42022053	When I was dayly with you in the teple ye stretched not forth hondes agaynst me . But this is even youre very houre and the power of darcknes .
42022054	Then toke they him and ledde him and brought him to the hye prestes housse . And peter folowed a farre of .
42022055	When they had kyndled a fyre in the middes of the palys and were set doune to geder Peter also sate doune amonge them .
42022056	And wone of the wenches behelde him as he sate by the fyer and set good eyesight on him and sayde : this same was also with him .
42022057	Then he denyed hym sayinge : woman I knowe him not
42022058	And after a lytell whyle another sawe him and sayde : thou arte also of them . And Peter sayd man I am not .
42022059	And aboute the space of an houre after another affirmed sayinge : verely even this felowe was with hym for he is of Galile
42022060	and Peter sayde : ma I woote not what thou sayest . And immediatly whyll he yet spake the cocke crewe .
42022061	And the Lorde tourned backe and loked apon Peter . And Peter remembred the wordes of the Lorde how he sayde vnto him before ye cocke crowe thou shalt denye me thryse .
42022062	And Peter went out and wepte bitterly .
42022063	And the men that stode about Iesus mocked him and smoote him
42022064	and blyndfolded him and smoote his face . And axed him sayinge : arede who it is that smoote ye ?
42022065	And many other thinges despytfullye sayd they agaynst him .
42022066	And assone as it was daye the elders of the people and the hye prestes and scribes came to gedder and ledde him into their counsell sayinge :
42022067	arte thou very Christ ? tell vs . And he sayde vnto the : yf I shall tell you ye will not beleve
42022068	And yf also I axe you ye will not answere me or let me goo .
42022069	Herafter shall the sonne of man sit on the ryght honde of the power of God .
42022070	Then sayde they all : Arte thou then the sonne of God ? He sayd to them : ye saye yt I am .
42022071	Then sayde they : what nede we eny further witnes ? We oure selves have herde of his awne mouthe .
42023001	And the whole multitude of them arose and ledde him vnto Pylate .
42023002	And they beganne to accuse him sayinge : We have founde this felowe pervertynge the people and forbiddynge to paye tribute to Cesar : sayinge that he is Christ a kynge .
42023003	And Pylate apposed him sayinge : arte thou the kynge of the iewes ? He answered him and sayde : thou sayest it .
42023004	Then sayde Pylate to the hye prestes and to the people : I fynde noo faute in this man .
42023005	And they were the moore fearce sayinge . He moveth the people teachynge thorowout all Iewry and beganne at Galile even to this place .
42023006	When Pilate hearde mencion of Galile he axed whether the ma were of Galile .
42023007	And assone as he knewe that he was of Herodes iurisdiccion he sent him to Herode which was also at Ierusalem in those dayes .
42023008	And when Herode sawe Iesus he was excedinglie gladde . For he was desyrous to se him of a longe season because he had hearde many thinges of him and trusted to have sene some myracle done by him .
42023009	Then questeoned he with him of many thinges . But he answered him not one worde .
42023010	The hye prestes and scribes stode forthe and accused him straytly .
42023011	And Herod wt his men of warre despysed him and mocked him and arayed him in whyte and sent him agayne to Pylate .
42023012	And the same daye Pylate and Herod were made frendes togeder . For before they were at variaunce .
42023013	And Pylate called to geder the hye prestes and the rulers and the people
42023014	and sayde vnto them : Ye have brought this man vnto me as one that perverted the people . And beholde I have examined him before you and have founde no faute in this man of those thinges where of ye accuse him .
42023015	No nor yet Herode . For I sent you to him : and lo no thinge worthy of deeth is done to him .
42023016	I will therfore chasten him and let him lowsse .
42023017	For of necessite he must have let one lowse vnto them at that feast .
42023018	And all the people cryed at once sayinge : awaye with him and delyvre to vs Barrabas :
42023019	which for insurrccion made in the cite and morther was cast into preson .
42023020	Pylate spake agayne to them willynge to let Iesus lowse .
42023021	And they cryed sayinge : Crucify him Crucify him
42023022	He sayde vnto them the thyrde tyme . What evyll hath he done ? I fynde no cause of deeth in him . I will therfore chasten him and let him lowse .
42023023	And they cryed with loude voyce and required that he myght be crucifyed . And the voyce of them and of the hye Prestes prevayled .
42023024	And Pylate gave sentence that it shuld be as they required
42023025	and let lowse vnto them him that for insurreccion and morther was cast into preson whom they desyred : and delyvered Iesus to do with him what they wolde .
42023026	And as they ledde him awaye they caught one Symon of Syrene commynge out of the felde : and on him layde they the crosse to beare it after Iesus .
42023027	And ther folowed him a greate company of people and of wemen which weme bewayled and lamented him .
42023028	But Iesus turned backe vnto them and sayde : Doughters of Ierusalem wepe not for me : but wepe for youre selves and for youre chyldren .
42023029	For beholde the dayes will come when men shall saye : happy are the baren and the wombes that never bare and the pappes which never gave sucke .
42023030	Then shall they beginne to saye to the mountaynes fall on vs : and to the hilles cover vs .
42023031	For yf they do this to a grene tree what shalbe done to the drye ?
42023032	And ther were two evyll doers ledde with him to be slayne .
42023033	And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary there they crucified him and the evyll doers one on ryght honde and the other on the lefte .
42023034	Then sayde Iesus : father forgeve them for they woot not what they do . And they parted his rayment and cast loottes .
42023035	And the people stode and behelde . And the rulers mocked him with thee saying : he holpe other men let him helpe him selfe yf he be Christ the chosen of god .
42023036	The soudiers also mocked him and came and gave him veneger
42023037	and sayde : yf thou be that kynge of ye Iewes save thy silfe .
42023038	And his superscripcio was writte over him in greke in latine and Ebreu : This is the kynge of the Iewes .
42023039	And one of the evyll doers which hanged rayled on him sayinge : If thou be Christ save thy selfe and vs .
42023040	The other answered and rebuked him sayinge . Net herfearest thou god because thou arte in the same damnacion ?
42023041	We are ryghteously punesshed for we receave accordynge to oure dedes : But this man hath done nothinge amysse .
42023042	And he sayde vnto Iesus : Lorde remember me when thou comest into thy kyngdome .
42023043	And Iesus sayde vnto him : Verely I saye vnto the to daye shalt thou be with me in Paradyse .
42023044	And it was about the sixt houre . And ther came a darcknes over all the londe vntyll ye nynth houre
42023045	and the sonne was darckened . And the vayle of the temple dyd rent even thorow the myddes .
42023046	And Iesus cryed with a greate voyce and sayd : Father into thy hondes I comende my sprete . And when he thus had sayd he gave vp the goost .
42023047	When ye Centurion sawe what had happened he glorified God sayinge : Of a surtie this man was perfecte .
42023048	And all the people that came to geder to that sight beholdynge the thinges which were done : smoote their bestes and returned home .
42023049	And all his acquayntaunce and the wemen that folowed him from Galile stode a farre of beholdynge these thinges .
42023050	And beholde ther was a man named Ioseph a councelloure and was a good man and a iuste
42023051	and dyd not consent to the counsell and dede of them which was of Aramathia a cite of the Iewes : which same also wayted for ye kyngdome of God :
42023052	he went vnto Pilate and begged the boddy of Iesus
42023053	and toke it doune and wrapped it in a lynnen clooth and layed it in an hewen toumbe wherin was never man before layed .
42023054	And that daye was ye Saboth even and the Saboth drue on .
42023055	The wemen that folowed after which came with him from Galile behelde the sepulcre and how his body was layed .
42023056	And they returned and prepared odoures and oyntmetes : but rested the Saboth daye accordynge to the commaundement .
42024001	On the morowe after the saboth erly in the morninge they came vnto the toumbe and brought the odoures which they had prepared and other wemen with them
42024002	And they founde the stone rouled awaye fro the sepulcre
42024003	and went in : but founde not the body of the Lorde Iesu .
42024004	And it happened as they were amased therat : Beholde two men stode by them in shynynge vestures .
42024005	And as they were a frayde and bowed doune their faces to the erth : they sayd to them : why seke ye the lyvinge amonge the deed ?
42024006	He is not here : but is rysen . Remember how he spake vnto you when he was yet with you in Galile
42024007	sayinge : that the sonne of man must be delyvered into the hondes of synfull men and be crucified and the thyrde daye ryse agayne .
42024008	And they remembred his wordes
42024009	and returned from the sepulcre and tolde all these thinges vnto the eleven and to all the remanaunt .
42024010	It was Mary Magdalen and Ioanna and Mary Iacobi and other that were with the which tolde these thinges vnto the Apostles
42024011	and their wordes semed vnto them fayned thinges nether beleved they them .
42024012	Then aroose Peter and ran vnto the sepulcre and stouped in and sawe the lynnen cloothes layde by them selfe and departed wondrynge in him selfe at that which had happened .
42024013	And beholde two of them went that same daye to a toune which was fro Ierusalem about thre scoore for longes called Emaus :
42024014	and they talked togeder of all these thinges that had happened .
42024015	And it chaunsed as they comened togeder and reasoned that Iesus him selfe drue neare and went with them .
42024016	But their eyes were holden that they coulde not knowe him .
42024017	And he sayde vnto them : What maner of comunicacions are these that ye have one to another as ye walke and are sadde .
42024018	And the one of them named Cleophas answered and sayd vnto him : arte thou only a straunger in Ierusalem and haste not knowen the thinges which have chaunsed therin in these dayes ?
42024019	To whom he sayd : what thinges ? And they sayd vnto him : of Iesus of Nazareth which was a Prophet myghtie in dede and worde before god and all the people .
42024020	And how the hye prestes and oure rulers delyvered him to be condempned to deeth : and have crucified him .
42024021	But we trusted that it shuld have bene he that shuld have delyvered Israel . And as touchynge all these thinges to daye is even the thyrd daye that they were done .
42024022	Ye and certayne wemen also of oure company made vs astonyed which came erly vnto the sepulcre
42024023	and founde not his boddy : and came sayinge that they had sene a vision of angels which sayde that he was alyve .
42024024	And certayne of them which were with vs went their waye to the sepulcre and founde it even so as the wemen had sayde : but him they sawe not .
42024025	And he sayde vnto the : O foles and slowe of herte to beleve all yt the prophetes have spoken .
42024026	Ought not Christ to have suffred these thinges and to enter into his glory ?
42024027	And he began at Moses and at all the prophetes and interpreted vnto them in all scriptures which were wrytten of him .
42024028	And they drue neye vnto the toune wich they went to . And he made as though he wolde have gone further .
42024029	But they constrayned him sayinge : abyde with vs for it draweth towardes nyght and the daye is farre passed . And he went in to tary with the .
42024030	And it came to passe as he sate at meate wt them he toke breed blessed it brake and gave to them .
42024031	And their eyes were openned and they knewe him : and he vnnisshed out of their syght .
42024032	And they sayde betwene them selves : dyd not oure hertes burne with in vs whyll he talked with vs by the waye and as he opened to vs the scriptures ?
42024033	And they roose vp the same houre and returned agayne to Ierusalem and founde the eleven gadered to geder and them that were with them which
42024034	sayde : the Lorde is rysen in dede and hath apered to Simon .
42024035	And they tolde what thinges was done in the waye and how they knewe him in breakynge of breed .
42024036	As they thus spake Iesus him selfe stode in ye myddes of them and sayde vnto them : peace be with you .
42024037	And they were abasshed and afrayde supposinge yt they had sene a sprete
42024038	And he sayde vnto the : Why are ye troubled and why do thoughtes aryse in youre hertes ?
42024039	Beholde my hondes and my fete that it is even my selfe . Handle me and se : for spretes have not flesshe and bones as ye se me have .
42024040	And when he had thus spoken he shewed them his hondes and his fete .
42024041	And whyll they yet beleved not for ioye and wondred he sayde vnto the : Have ye here eny meate ?
42024042	And they gave him a pece of a broyled fisshe and of an hony combe .
42024043	And he toke it and ate it before them .
42024044	And he sayde vnto the . These are the wordes which I spake vnto you whyll I was yet with you : that all must be fulfilled which were written of me in the lawe of Moses and in the Prophetes and in the Psalmes .
42024045	Then openned he their wyttes that they myght vnderstond the scriptures
42024046	and sayde vnto them . Thus is it written and thus it behoved Christ to suffre and to ryse agayne from deeth the thyrde daye
42024047	and that repentaunce and remission of synnes shuld be preached in his name amonge all nacions and must beginne at Ierusalem .
42024048	And ye are witnesses of these thinges .
42024049	And beholde I will sende the promes of my father apon you . But tary ye in ye cite of Ierusalem vntyll ye be endewed with power from an hye .
42024050	And he ledde the out into Bethany and lyfte vp his hondes and blest them .
42024051	And it cam to passe as he blessed the he departed from the and was caryed vp in to heven .
42024052	And they worshipped him and returned to Ierusalem with greate ioye
42024053	and were continually in the temple praysinge and laudinge God . Amen .
43001001	In the beginnynge was the worde and the worde was with God : and the worde was God .
43001002	The same was in the beginnynge with God .
43001003	All thinges were made by it and with out it was made nothinge that was made .
43001004	In it was lyfe and the lyfe was ye lyght of men
43001005	and the lyght shyneth in the darcknes but the darcknes comprehended it not .
43001006	There was a man sent from God whose name was Iohn .
43001007	The same cam as a witnes to beare witnes of the lyght that all men through him myght beleve .
43001008	He was not that lyght : but to beare witnes of the lyght .
43001009	That was a true lyght which lyghteth all men that come into the worlde .
43001010	He was in ye worlde and the worlde was made by him : and yet the worlde knewe him not .
43001011	He cam amonge his ( awne ) and his awne receaved him not .
43001012	But as meny as receaved him to them he gave power to be the sonnes of God in yt they beleved on his name :
43001013	which were borne not of bloude nor of the will of the flesshe nor yet of the will of man : but of God .
43001014	And the worde was made flesshe and dwelt amonge vs and we sawe the glory of it as the glory of the only begotten sonne of ye father which worde was full of grace and verite .
43001015	Iohn bare witnes of him and cryed sayinge : This was he of whome I spake he that cometh after me was before me because he was yer then I .
43001016	And of his fulnes have all we receaved even ( grace ) for grace .
43001017	For the lawe was geven by Moses but grace and truthe came by Iesus Christ .
43001018	No ma hath sene God at eny tyme . The only begotte sonne which is in ye bosome of ye father he hath declared him .
43001019	And this is the recorde of Iohn : When the Iewes sent Prestes and Levites from Ierusalem to axe him what arte thou ?
43001020	And he confessed and denyed not and sayde playnly : I am not Christ .
43001021	And they axed him : what then ? arte thou Helyas ? And he sayde : I am not . Arte thou a Prophete ? And he answered no .
43001022	Then sayd they vnto him : what arte thou that we maye geve an answer to them that sent vs : What sayest thou of thy selfe ?
43001023	He sayde : I am the voyce of a cryar in the wyldernes make strayght the waye of the Lorde as sayde the Prophete Esaias .
43001024	And they which were sent were of the pharises .
43001025	And they axed him and sayde vnto him : why baptisest thou then yf thou be not Christ nor Helyas nether a Prophet ?
43001026	Iohn answered them sayinge : I baptise with water : but one is come amonge you whom ye knowe not
43001027	he it is that cometh after me whiche was before me whose sho latchet I am not worthy to vnlose .
43001028	These thinges were done in Bethabara beyonde Iordan where Iohn dyd baptyse .
43001029	The nexte daye Iohn sawe Iesus commyge vnto him and sayde : beholde the lambe of God which taketh awaye the synne of the worlde .
43001030	This is he of whom I sayde . After me cometh a man which was before me for he was yer then I
43001031	and I knew him not : but that he shuld be declared to Israell therfore am I come baptisynge with water .
43001032	And Iohn bare recorde sayinge : I sawe the sprete descende from heven lyke vnto a dove and abyde apon him
43001033	and I knewe him not . But he that sent me to baptise in water the same sayde vnto me : apon whom thou shalt se the sprete descende and tary styll on him the same is he which baptiseth with the holy goost .
43001034	And I sawe and bare recorde that this is the sonne of God .
43001035	The next daye after Iohn stode agayne and two of his disciples .
43001036	And he behelde Iesus as he walked by and sayde : beholde the lambe of God .
43001037	And the two disciples hearde him speake and folowed Iesus .
43001038	And Iesus turned about and sawe them folowe and sayde vnto them : what seke ye ? They sayde vnto him : Rabbi ( which is to saye by interpretacion Master ) where dwellest thou ?
43001039	He sayde vnto them : come and se . They came and sawe where he dwelt : and abode with him that daye . For it was about the tenthe houre .
43001040	One of the two which hearde Iohn speake and folowed Iesus was Andrew Simon Peters brother .
43001041	The same founde his brother Simon fyrst and sayde vnto him : we have founde Messias which is by interpretacion annoynted :
43001042	and brought him to Iesus . And Iesus behelde him and sayde : thou arte Simon the sonne of Ionas thou shalt be called Cephas : which is by interpretacion a stone .
43001043	The daye folowynge Iesus wolde goo into Galile and founde Philip and sayde vnto him folowe me .
43001044	Philip was of Bethsaida the cite of Andrew and Peter .
43001045	And Philip founde Nathanael and sayde vnto him . We have founde him of whom Moses in the lawe and the prophetes dyd wryte . Iesus the sonne of Ioseph of Nazareth .
43001046	And Nathanael sayde vnto him : can ther eny good thinge come out of Nazareth ? Philip sayde to him : come and se .
43001047	Iesus sawe Nathanael commynge to him and sayde of him . Beholde a ryght Israelite in who is no gyle .
43001048	Nathanael sayd vnto him : where knewest thou me ? Iesus answered and sayde vnto him : Before that Philip called the when thou wast vnder ye fygge tree I sawe the .
43001049	Nathanael answered and sayde vnto him : Rabbi thou arte the sonne of God thou arte the kynge of Israel .
43001050	Iesus answered and sayd vnto him : Because I sayde vnto the I sawe the vnder the fygge tree thou belevest . Thou shalt se greater thinges then these .
43001051	And he sayde vnto him : Verely verely I saye vnto you : herafter shall ye se heven open and the angels of God ascendynge and descendynge over the sonne of man .
43002001	And the thryde daye was ther a mariage in Cana a cite of Galile : and the mother of Iesus was there .
43002002	And Iesus was called also and his disciples vnto the mariage .
43002003	And when the wyne fayled the mother of Iesus sayde vnto him : they have no wyne .
43002004	Iesus sayde vnto her : woman what have I to do with the ? myne houre is not yet come .
43002005	His mother sayde vnto the ministres : whatsoever he sayeth vnto you do it .
43002006	And therwere stondynge theare sixe water pottes of stone after ye maner of the purifyinge of ye Iewes contaynynge two or thre fyrkins a pece .
43002007	And Iesus sayde vnto them : fyll the water pottes with water . And they fylled them vp to the brym .
43002008	And he sayde vnto them : drawe out now and beare vnto the governer of the feaste . And they bare it .
43002009	When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was turned vnto wyne and knewe not whence it was ( but the ministres which drue the water knew ) . He called the brydegrome
43002010	and sayde vnto him . All men at the beginnynge set forth good wyne and when men be dronke then that which is worsse . But thou hast kept backe the good wyne vntyll now .
43002011	This beginnynge of miracles dyd Iesus in Cana of Galile and shewed his glory and his disciples beleved on him .
43002012	After that he descended in to Capernaum and his mother and his brethren and his disciples : but contynued not manye dayes there .
43002013	And the Iewes ester was even at honde and Iesus went vp to Ierusalem
43002014	and founde syttynge in the temple those that solde oxen and shepe and doves and chaungers of money .
43002015	And he made a scourge of small cordes and drave them all out of the temple with the shepe and oxen and powred oute the changers money and overthrue the tables
43002016	and sayde vnto them that solde doves : Have these thinges hence and make not my fathers housse an housse of marchaundyse .
43002017	And his disciples remembred how yt it was wrytten : the zele of thyne housse hath even eaten me .
43002018	Then answered the Iewes and sayde vnto him : what token shewest thou vnto vs seynge that thou dost these thinges ?
43002019	Iesus answered and sayd vnto them : destroye this temple and in thre dayes I will reare it vp agayne .
43002020	Then sayde the Iewes : xlvi . yeares was this temple abuyldinge : and wylt thou reare it vp in thre dayes ?
43002021	But he spake of the temple of his body .
43002022	Assone therfore as he was rysen from deeth agayne his disciples remembred that he thus sayde . And they beleved the scripture and the wordes which Iesus had sayde .
43002023	When he was at Ierusalem at ester in the feaste many beleved on his name when they sawe his miracles which he dyd .
43002024	But Iesus put not him selfe in their hondes because he knewe all men
43002025	and neded not that eny man shuld testify of man . For he knewe what was in man .
43003001	Ther was a man of the pharises named Nicodemus a ruler amonge ye Iewes .
43003002	The same cam to Iesus by nyght and sayde vnto him : Rabbi we knowe that thou arte a teacher whiche arte come from God . For no man coulde do suche miracles as thou doest except God were with him .
43003003	Iesus answered and sayde vnto him : Verely verely I saye vnto the : except a man be boren a newe he cannot se the kyngdom of God .
43003004	Nicodemus sayde vnto him : how can a man be boren when he is olde ? can he enter into his moders wombe and be boren agayne ?
43003005	Iesus answered : verely verely I saye vnto the : except that a man be boren of water and of ye sprete he cannot enter into the kyngdome of god .
43003006	That which is boren of the flesshe is flesshe : and that which is boren of the sprete is sprete .
43003007	Marvayle not that I sayd to the ye must be boren a newe .
43003008	The wynde bloweth where he listeth and thou hearest his sounde : but canst not tell whence he cometh and whether he goeth . So is every man that is boren of the sprete .
43003009	And Nicodemus answered and sayde vnto him : how can these thinges be ?
43003010	Iesus answered and sayde vnto him : arte thou a master in Israel and knowest not these thinges ?
43003011	Verely verely I saye vnto the we speake that we knowe and testify that we have sene : and ye receave not oure witnes .
43003012	Yf when I tell you erthely thinges ye beleve not : how shuld ye beleve yf I shall tell you of hevenly thinges ?
43003013	And no man ascendeth vp to heaven but he that came doune from heaven that is to saye the sonne of man which is in heaven .
43003014	And as Moses lifte vp the serpent in the wyldernes even so must the sonne of man be lifte vp
43003015	that none that beleveth in him perisshe : but have eternall lyfe .
43003016	For God so loveth the worlde yt he hath geven his only sonne that none that beleve in him shuld perisshe : but shuld have everlastinge lyfe .
43003017	For God sent not his sonne into the worlde to condepne the worlde : but that the worlde through him might be saved .
43003018	He that beleveth on him shall not be condepned . But he that beleveth not is condempned all redy be cause he beleveth not in the name of the only sonne of God .
43003019	And this is the condempnacion : that light is come into the worlde and the me loved darcknes more then light because their dedes were evill .
43003020	For every man that evyll doeth hateth the light : nether commeth to light lest his dedes shuld be reproved .
43003021	But he that doth truth commeth to the light that his dedes might be knowen how that they are wrought in God .
43003022	After these thinges cam Iesus and his disciples into the Iewes londe and ther he haunted with them and baptised .
43003023	And Iohn also baptised in Enon besydes Salim because ther was moche water there and they came and were baptised .
43003024	For Iohn was not yet cast into preson .
43003025	And ther arose a questio bitwene Iohns disciples and the Iewes about purifiynge .
43003026	And they came vnto Iohn and sayde vnto him : Rabbi he that was with the beyonde Iordan to whom thou barest witnes . Beholde the same baptyseth and all me come to him .
43003027	Iohn answered and sayde : a man can receave no thinge at all except it be geve him fro heaven .
43003028	Ye youre selves are witnesses how that I sayde : I am not Christ but am sent before him .
43003029	He that hath the bryde is the brydegrome . But the frende of the brydegrome which stondeth by and heareth him reioyseth greately of the brydgromes voyce . Tis my ioye is fulfilled .
43003030	He must increace : and I muste decreace .
43003031	He that commeth from an hye is above all : He that is of ye erth is of the erth and speaketh of the erth . He that cometh from heaven is above all
43003032	and what he hath sene and hearde : that he testifieth : but no man receaveth his testimonye .
43003033	How be it he that hath receaved hys testimonye hath set to his seale that God is true .
43003034	For he whom God hath sent speaketh the wordes of God . For God geveth not the sprete by measure .
43003035	The father loveth the sonne and hath geven all thinges into his honde .
43003036	He that beleveth on the sonne hath everlastynge lyfe : and he that beleveth not the sonne shall not se lyfe but the wrathe of God abydeth on him .
43004001	Assone as the Lorde had knowledge how the Pharises had hearde that Iesus made and baptised moo disciples then Iohn
43004002	( though that Iesus him selfe baptised not : but his disciples )
43004003	he lefte Iewry and departed agayne into Galile .
43004004	And it was so that he must nedes goo thorowe Samaria .
43004005	Then came he to a cyte of Samaria called Sichar besydes the possession that Iacob gave to his sonne Ioseph .
43004006	And there was Iacobs well . Iesus then weryed in his iorney sate thus on the well . And it was about the sixte houre :
43004007	and there came a woman of Samaria to drawe water . And Iesus sayde vnto her : geve me drynke .
43004008	For his disciples were gone awaye vnto the toune to bye meate .
43004009	Then sayde the woman of Samaria vnto him : how is it that thou beinge a Iewe axest drinke of me which am a Samaritane ? for the Iewes medle not with the Samaritans .
43004010	Iesus answered and sayde vnto hir : yf thou knewest the gyfte of God and who it is that sayeth to the geve me drynke thou woldest have axed of him and he wolde have geven the water of lyfe .
43004011	The woman sayde vnto him . Syr thou hast no thinge to drawe with and the well is depe : from whence then hast thou yt water of lyfe ?
43004012	Arte thou greater then oure father Iacob which gave vs the well and he him silfe dranke therof and his chyldren and his catell ?
43004013	Iesus answered and sayde vnto hir : whosoever drinketh of this water shall thurst agayne .
43004014	But whosoever shall drinke of ye water yt I shall geve him shall never be more a thyrst : but the water that I shall geve him shalbe in him a well of water springinge vp in to everlastinge lyfe .
43004015	The woma sayd vnto him : Syr geve me of that water that I thyrst not nether come hedder to drawe .
43004016	Iesus sayde vnto her . Go and call thy husband and come hydder .
43004017	The woman answered and sayde to him : I have no husband .
43004018	Iesus sayde to her . Thou hast well sayd I have no husbande . For thou haste had five husbandes and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband . That saydest thou truely .
43004019	The woman sayde vnto him : Syr I perceave yt thou arte a prophet .
43004020	Oure fathers worshipped in this mountayne : and ye saye that in Hierusalem is the place where men ought to worshippe .
43004021	Iesus sayde vnto her : woman beleve me the houre cometh when ye shall nether in this moutayne nor yet at Ierusalem worshippe the father .
43004022	Ye worshippe ye wot not what : we knowe what we worshippe . For salvacion cometh of the Iewes .
43004023	But the houre commeth and nowe is when the true worshippers shall worshippe the father in sprete and in trouthe . For verely suche the father requyreth to worshippe him .
43004024	God is a sprete and they that worshippe him must worshippe him in sprete and trouthe .
43004025	The woman sayde vnto him : I wot well Messias shall come which is called Christ . When he is come he will tell vs all thinges .
43004026	Iesus sayde vnto hir : I that speake vnto the am he .
43004027	And eve at that poynte came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with the woman . Yet no man sayde vnto him : what meanest thou or why talkest thou with her ?
43004028	The woma then lefte her waterpot and went her waye into the cite and sayde to the men .
43004029	Come se a man which tolde me all thinges yt ever I dyd . Is not he Christ ?
43004030	Then they went ont of the cite and came vnto him .
43004031	And in ye meane while his disciples prayed him sayinge : Master eate .
43004032	He sayde vnto the : I have meate to eate that ye knowe not of .
43004033	Then sayd ye disciples bitwene them selves : hath eny ma brought him meate ?
43004034	Iesus sayde vnto them : my meate is to doo the will of him that sent me . And to fynnysshe his worke .
43004035	Saye not ye : there are yet foure monethes and then cometh harvest ? Beholde I saye vnto you lyfte vp youre eyes and loke on ye regios : for they are whyte all redy vnto harvest .
43004036	And he ye repeth receaveth rewarde and gaddereth frute vnto life eternall : that bothe he that soweth and he yt repeth myght reioyse to gether .
43004037	And herin is the sayinge true yt one soweth and another repeth .
43004038	I sent you to repe yt whero ye bestowed no laboure . Other men laboured and ye are entred into their labours .
43004039	Many of the Samaritas of that cyte beleved on him for ye sayinge of the woma which testified : he tolde me all thinges yt ever I dyd .
43004040	Then when the Samaritas were come vnto him they besought him yt he wolde tary wt the . And he aboode there two dayes .
43004041	And many moo beleved because of his awne wordes
43004042	and sayd vnto the woman : Now we beleve not because of thy sayinge . For we have herde him oure selves and knowe that this is even in dede Christ the savioure of the worlde .
43004043	After two dayes he departed thence and wet awaye into Galile .
43004044	And Iesus him selfe testified that a Prophete hath none honoure in his awne countre .
43004045	Then assone as he was come into Galile the Galileans receaved him which had sene all the thinges yt he dyd at Ierusalem at ye feast . For they wet also vnto ye feast daye .
43004046	And Iesus came agayne into Cana of Galile wher he turned water into wyne . And ther was a certayne ruler whose sonne was sicke at Capernaum .
43004047	Assone as the same herde that Iesus was come out of Iewry into Galile he wet vnto him and besought him yt he wolde descende and heale his sonne : For he was eve readie to dye .
43004048	Then sayde Iesus vnto him : excepte ye se signes and wodres ye canot beleve .
43004049	The ruler sayd vnto him : Syr come awaye or ever yt my chylde dye .
43004050	Iesus sayde vnto him goo thy waye thy sonne liveth . And the ma beleved ye wordes yt Iesus had spoke vnto him and wet his waye .
43004051	And anone as he went on his waye his servantes met him and tolde him sayinge : thy chylde liveth .
43004052	Then enquyred he of the the houre when he begane to amende . And they sayde vnto him : Yester daye the sevethe houre the fever lefte him .
43004053	And the father knew that it was the same houre in which Iesus sayde vnto him : Thy sonne liveth . And he beleved and all his housholde .
43004054	Thys is agayne the seconde myracle yt Iesus dyd after he was come oute of Iewry into Galile .
43005001	After that ther was a feast of the Iewes and Iesus went vp to Ierusalem .
43005002	And ther is at Ierusalem by ye slaughterhousse a pole called in ye Ebrue toge Bethseda havinge five porches
43005003	in which laye a greate multitude of sicke folke of blinde halt and wyddered waytinge for the movinge of the water .
43005004	For an angell wet doune at a certayne ceason into ye pole and troubled ye water . Whosoever then fyrst after the steringe of the water stepped in was made whoale of what soever disease he had .
43005005	And a certayne ma was theare which had bene diseased . xxxviii . yeares .
43005006	When Iesus sawe him lye and knewe that he now longe tyme had bene diseased he sayde vnto him . Wilt thou be made whoale ?
43005007	The sicke answered him : Syr I have no man whe the water is troubled to put me into the pole . But in the meane tyme whill I am about to come another steppeth doune before me .
43005008	And Iesus sayde vnto him : ryse take vp thy beed and walke .
43005009	And immediatly the man was made whole and toke vp his beed and went . And the same daye was the Saboth daye .
43005010	The Iewes therfore sayde vnto him that was made whole . It is ye Saboth daye it is not laufull for the to cary thy beed .
43005011	He answered them : he that made me whole sayde vnto me : take vp thy beed and get the hence .
43005012	Then axed they him : what man is that which sayde vnto the take vp thy beed and walke .
43005013	And he yt was healed wist not who it was . For Iesus had gotte him selfe awaye be cause yt ther was preace of people in ye place .
43005014	And after that Iesus founde him in the teple and sayd vnto him : beholde thou arte made whole synne no moore lest a worsse thinge happe vnto the .
43005015	The man departed and tolde ye Iewes that yt was Iesus whiche had made him whole .
43005016	And therfore the Iewes dyd persecute Iesus and sought the meanes to slee him because he had done these thinges on the Saboth daye .
43005017	And Iesus answered them : my father worketh hidder to and I worke .
43005018	Therfore the Iewes sought the moare to kill him not only because he had broken the Saboth : but sayde also that God was his father and made him selfe equall with God .
43005019	Then answered Iesus and sayde vnto them : verely verely I saye vnto you : the sonne can do no thinge of him selfe but that he seeth ye father do . For whatsoever he doeth yt doeth the sonne also .
43005020	For the father loveth ye sonne and sheweth him all thinges whatsoever he him selfe doeth . And he will shewe him greter workes then these because ye shoulde marvayle .
43005021	For lykwyse as the father rayseth vp ye deed and quickeneth them even so the sonne quyckeneth whom he will .
43005022	Nether iudgeth ye father eny ma : but hath comitted all iudgemet vnto the sonne
43005023	because that all men shuld honoure the sonne eve as they honoure the father . He that honoureth not ye sonne the same honoureth not the father which hath sent him .
43005024	Verely verely I saye vnto you : He that heareth my wordes and beleveth on him that sent me hath everlastinge lyfe and shall not come into damnacion : but is scaped fro deth vnto lyfe .
43005025	Verely verely I saye vnto you : the tyme shall come and now is when the deed shall heare the voyce of the sonne of God . And they yt heare shall live .
43005026	For as the father hath life in him silfe : so lyke wyse hath he geven to ye sonne to have lyfe in him silfe :
43005027	and hath geven him power also to iudge in that he is the sonne of man .
43005028	Marvayle not at this ye houre shall come in the which all yt are in the graves shall heare his voice
43005029	and shall come forthe : they that have done good vnto the resurreccion of lyfe : and they that have done evyll vnto the resurreccion of dampnacion .
43005030	I can of myne awne selfe do nothinge at all . As I heare I iudge and my iudgemet is iust because I seke not myne awne will but the will of ye father which hath sent me .
43005031	Yf I beare witnes of my selfe my witnes is not true .
43005032	Ther is a nother that beareth witnes of me and I am sure that the witnes whiche he beareth of me is true .
43005033	Ye sent vnto Iohn and he bare witnes vnto the truthe .
43005034	But I receave not the recorde of man . Neverthelesse these thinges I saye that ye might be safe .
43005035	He was a burninge and a shyninge light and ye wolde for a season have reioysed in his light .
43005036	But I have greater witnes then the witnes of Iohn . For ye workes which ye father hath geve me to fynisshe : the same workes which I do beare witnes of me that ye father sent me .
43005037	And the father him silfe which hath sent me beareth witnes of me . Ye have not hearde his voyce at eny tyme nor ye have sene his shape :
43005038	therto his wordes have ye not abydinge in you . For whome he hath sent : him ye beleve not .
43005039	Searche the scriptures for in them ye thinke ye have eternall lyfe : and they are they which testify of me .
43005040	And yet will ye not come to me that ye might have lyfe .
43005041	I receave not prayse of men .
43005042	But I knowe you that ye have not the love of God in you
43005043	I am come in my fathers name and ye receave me not . Yf another shall come in his awne name him will ye receave .
43005044	How can ye beleve which receave honoure one of another and seke not the honoure that commeth of God only ?
43005045	Doo not thinke that I wyll accuse you to my father . Ther is one that accuseth you eve Moses in whom ye trust .
43005046	For had ye beleved Moses ye wold have beleved me : for he wrote of me .
43005047	But now ye beleve not his writinge : how shall ye beleve my wordes .
43006001	After these thinges Iesus wet his waye over the see of Galile nye to a cyte called Tiberias .
43006002	And a greate multitude folowed him because they had sene his myracles which he dyd on them that were diseased .
43006003	And Iesus went vp into a mountayne and there he sate with his disciples .
43006004	And ester a feast of ye Iewes was nye .
43006005	Then Iesus lifte vp his eyes and sawe a greate copany come vnto him and sayde vnto Philip : whence shall we bye breed yt these might eate .
43006006	This he sayde to prove him : for he him sylfe knewe what he wolde do .
43006007	Philip answered him two hondred peny worthe of breed are not sufficient for them yt every ma have a litell .
43006008	Then sayde vnto him one of his disciples Andrew Simon Peters brother .
43006009	There ys a lad here which hath fyve barly loves and two fisshes : but what is that amoge so many ?
43006010	And Iesus sayde . Make the people sit doune : Ther was moche grasse in the place . And the men sate doune in nombre about five thousande .
43006011	And Iesus toke the breed and gave thankes and gave to the disciples and his disciples to them that were set doune . And lykwyse of the fysshes as moche as they wolde .
43006012	When they had eate ynough he sayd vnto his disciples : gadder vp the broke meate that remayneth : that nothinge be loost .
43006013	And they gadered it to geder and fylled twelve baskettes with the broken meate of the five barly loves which broken meate remayned vnto the that had eaten .
43006014	Then the men when they had sene the myracle that Iesus dyd sayde : This is of a trueth the Prophet that shuld come into the worlde .
43006015	When Iesus perceaved that they wolde come and take him vp to make him kinge he departed agayne into a mountayne him silfe a lone .
43006016	And when eve was come his disciples wet vnto the see
43006017	and entred into a shyppe and went over the see vnto Capernaum . And anone it was darcke and Iesus was not come to them .
43006018	And ye see arose with a greate winde yt blew .
43006019	And when they had rowe aboute a . xxv . or a xxx . furlonges they sawe Iesus walke on ye see and drawe nye vnto the shyp and they were afrayed .
43006020	And he sayde vnto them : It is I be not a frayde .
43006021	Then wolde they have receaved him into the shyp and the ship was by and by at the londe whyther they went .
43006022	The daye folowynge the people which stode on the other syde of the see sawe that ther was none other shyp theare save yt one wher in his disciples were entred and that Iesus went not in with his disciples into the ship : but that his disciples were gone awaye alone .
43006023	How be it ther came other shippes from Tiberias nye vnto the place where they ate breed when the Lorde had blessed .
43006024	Then whe the people sawe that Iesus was not there nether his disciples they also toke shippinge and came to Caparnaum sekinge for Iesus .
43006025	And when they had founde him on ye other syde of ye see they sayd vnto him : Rabbi whe camest thou hidder ?
43006026	Iesus answered them and sayde : verely verely I saye vnto you : ye seke me not because ye sawe the myracles : but because ye ate of the loves and were filled .
43006027	Laboure not for ye meate which perissheth but for ye meate that endureth vnto everlastynge lyfe whiche meate ye sonne of ma shall geve vnto you . For him hath god ye father sealed .
43006028	Then sayd they vnto him : what shall we do that we myght worke ye workes of God ?
43006029	Iesus answered and sayde vnto them . This is ye worke of God that ye beleve on him who he hath sent .
43006030	They sayde vnto him : what signe shewest thou then that we maye se and beleve the ? What doest thou worke ?
43006031	Oure fathers dyd eate Manna in the desert as yt is writte : He gave them breed fro heaven to eate .
43006032	Iesus sayde vnto the : verely verely I saye vnto you : Moses gave you breed fro heave : but my father geveth you the true breed fro heave .
43006033	For the breed of God is he which cometh doune from heave and geveth lyfe vnto the worlde .
43006034	Then sayde they vnto him : Lorde ever moore geve vs this breed .
43006035	And Iesus sayde vnto them : I am that breed of life . He that cometh to me shall not honger : and he that beleveth on me shall never thurst .
43006036	But I sayed vnto you : that ye have sene me aud yet beleve not .
43006037	All that the father geveth me shall come to me : and him yt cometh to me I cast not awaye .
43006038	For I came doune fro heaven : not to do myne awne will but his will which hath sent me .
43006039	And this is the fathers will which hath sent me that of all which he hath geven me I shuld loose no thinge : but shuld rayse it vp agayne at the last daye .
43006040	And this is the wyll of him yt sent me : yt every man which seith ye sonne and beleveth on him have everlastinge lyfe . And I will rayse him vp at ye last daye .
43006041	The Iewes then murmured at him because he sayde : I am that breed which is come doune from heaven .
43006042	And they sayde : Is not this Iesus ye sonne of Ioseph whose father and mother we knowe ? How ys yt then that he sayeth I came doune from heave ?
43006043	Iesus answered and sayde vnto them . Murmur not betwene youre selves .
43006044	No man can come to me except the father which hath sent me drawe him . And I will rayse him vp at the last daye .
43006045	It is written in the Prophetes yt they shall all be taught of God . Every man therfore that hath hearde and hath learned of the father commeth vnto me .
43006046	Not that eny man hath sene ye father save he which is of God : the same hath sene the father .
43006047	Verely verely I saye vnto you he that beleveth on me hath everlastinge lyfe .
43006048	I am that breed of lyfe .
43006049	Youre fathers dyd eate Mana in ye wildernes and are deed .
43006050	This is that breed which cometh fro heave yt he which eateth of it shuld also not dye .
43006051	I am that lyvinge breed which came doune from heave . Yf eny man eate of this breed he shall live forever . And the breed that I will geve is my flesshe which I will geve for the lyfe of ye worlde
43006052	And the Iewes strove amoge them selves sayinge : How can this felowe geve vs his flesshe to eate ?
43006053	Then Iesus sayde vnto them : Verely verely I saye vnto you except ye eate ye flesshe of ye sonne of man and drinke his bloude ye shall not have lyfe in you .
43006054	Whosoever eateth my flesshe and drinketh my bloude hath eternall lyfe : and I will rayse him vp at the last daye .
43006055	For my flesshe is meate in dede : and my bloude is drynke in dede .
43006056	He that eateth my flesshe and drynketh my bloude dwelleth in me and I in him .
43006057	As the lyvinge father hath sent me even so lyve I by my father : and he that eateth me shall live by me .
43006058	This is the breed which cam from heave : not as youre fathers have eaten Manna and are deed . He that eateth of this breed shall live ever .
43006059	These thinges sayd he in the synagoge as he taught in Capernaum .
43006060	Many of his disciples when they had herde this sayde : this is an herde sayinge : who can abyde the hearinge of it ?
43006061	Iesus knew in him selfe that his disciples murmured at it and sayde vnto them : Doth this offende you ?
43006062	What and yf ye shall se the sonne of man ascede vp where he was before ?
43006063	It is the sprete that quyckeneth the flesshe proffeteth nothinge . The wordes that I speake vnto you are sprete and lyfe .
43006064	But ther are some of you that beleve not . For Iesus knewe from the begynnynge which they were that beleved not and who shuld betraye him .
43006065	And he sayde : Therfore sayde I vnto you : that no man can come vnto me except it were geven vnto him of my father .
43006066	From that tyme many of his disciples wet backe and walked no moore with him .
43006067	Then sayde Iesus to the twelve : will ye alsoo goo awaye ?
43006068	Then Simon Peter answered : Master to whom shall we goo ? Thou haste the wordes of eternall lyfe
43006069	and we beleve and knowe yt thou arte Christ the sonne of the lyvinge God .
43006070	Iesus answered them : Have not I chosen you twelve and yet one of you is the devyll ?
43006071	He spake it of Iudas Iscariot the sonne of Simon . For he it was yt shuld betraye him and was one of the twelve .
43007001	After that Iesus wet about in Galile and wolde not go about in Iewry for the Iewes sought to kill him .
43007002	The Iewes tabernacle feast was at honde .
43007003	His brethren therfore sayde vnto him : get ye hence and go into Iewry yt thy disciples maye se thy workes yt thou doest .
43007004	For ther is no man yt doeth eny thing secretly and he him selfe seketh to be knowen . Yf thou do soche thinges shewe thy selfe to the worlde .
43007005	For as yet his brethre beleved not in him .
43007006	Then Iesus sayd vnto them : My tyme is not yet come youre tyme is all waye redy .
43007007	The worlde canot hate you . Me it hateth : because I testify of it that the workes of it are evyll .
43007008	Go ye vp vnto this feast . I will not go vp yet vnto this feast for my tyme is not yet full come .
43007009	These wordes he sayde vnto them and abode still in Galile .
43007010	But assone as his brethren were goone vp then went he also vp vnto the feast : not openly but as it were prevely .
43007011	Then sought him the Iewes at ye feast and sayde : Where is he ?
43007012	And moche murmurynge was ther of him amonge the people . Some sayde : He is good . Wother sayde naye but he deceaveth the people .
43007013	How be it no ma spake openly of him for feare of the Iewes
43007014	In ye middes of the feast Iesus went vp into the temple and taught .
43007015	And the Iewes marveylled sayinge : How knoweth he ye scriptures seynge yt he never learned ?
43007016	Iesus answered them and sayde : My doctrine is not myne : but his that sent me .
43007017	If eny man will do his will he shall knowe of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speake of my selfe .
43007018	He that speaketh of him selfe seketh his awne prayse . But he that seketh his prayse that sent him the same is true and no vnrightewesnes is in him .
43007019	Dyd not Moses geve you a lawe and yet none of you kepeth ye lawe ? Why goo ye aboute to kyll me ?
43007020	The people answered and sayde : thou hast the devyll : who goeth aboute to kyll the ?
43007021	Iesus answered and sayde to them : I have done one worke and ye all marvayle .
43007022	Moses therfore gave vnto you circumcision : not because it is of Moses but of the fathers . And yet ye on the Saboth daye circumcise a man .
43007023	If a man on the Saboth daye receave circumcision without breakinge of the lawe of Moses : disdayne ye at me because I have made a man every whit whoale on the saboth daye ?
43007024	Iudge not after the vtter aperaunce : but iudge rightewes iudgement .
43007025	Then sayd some of them of Ierusalem : Is not this he who they goo aboute to kyll ?
43007026	Beholde he speaketh boldly and they saye nothinge to him . Do the rulars knowe in dede that this is very Christ ?
43007027	How be it we knowe this man whence he is : but when Christ cometh no man shall knowe whence he is .
43007028	Then cryed Iesus in ye temple as he taught sayinge : ye knowe me and whence I am ye knowe . And yet I am not come of my selfe but he yt sent me is true whom ye knowe not .
43007029	I knowe him : for I am of him and he hath sent me .
43007030	Then they sought to take him : but no ma layde hondes on him because his tyme was not yet come .
43007031	Many of the people beleved on him and sayde : when Christ cometh will he do moo miracles then this man hath done ?
43007032	The pharises hearde that the people murmured suche thinges about him . Wherfore ye pharises and hye prestes sent ministres forthe to take him .
43007033	Then sayde Iesus vnto the : Yet am I a lytell whyle with you and then goo I vnto him that sent me .
43007034	Ye shall seke me and shall not fynde me : and where I am thyther can ye not come .
43007035	Then sayde the Iewes bitwene the selves : whyther will he goo that we shall not fynde him ? Will he goo amonge the gentyls which are scattered all a broade and teache the gentyls ?
43007036	What maner of sayinge is this that he sayde : ye shall seke me and shall not fynde me : and where I am thyther can ye not come ?
43007037	In the last daye that great daye of the feaste Iesus stode and cryed sayinge : If eny man thyrst let him come vnto me and drinke .
43007038	He that beleveth on me as sayeth the scripture out of his belly shall flowe ryvers of water of lyfe .
43007039	This spak he of the sprete which they that beleved on him shuld receave . For the holy goost was not yet there because that Iesus was not yet glorifyed .
43007040	Many of the people when they hearde this sayinge sayd : of a truth this is a prophet
43007041	Other sayde : this is Christ . Some sayde : shall Christ come out of Galile ?
43007042	Sayeth not the scripture that Christ shall come of the seed of David : and out of the toune of Bethleem where David was ?
43007043	So was ther dissencion amonge the people aboute him .
43007044	And some of them wolde have taken him : but no man layed hondes on him .
43007045	Then came ye ministres to ye hye prestes and pharises . And they sayde vnto the : why have ye not brought him ?
43007046	The servautes answered never man spake as this man doeth .
43007047	Then answered the the pharises : are ye also disceaved ?
43007048	Doth eny of the rulers or of the pharises beleve on him ?
43007049	But the comen people whiche knowe not ye lawe are cursed .
43007050	Nicodemus sayde vnto them : He that came to Iesus by nyght and was one of them .
43007051	Doth oure lawe iudge eny man before it heare him and knowe what he hath done ?
43007052	They answered and sayde vnto him : arte thou also of Galile ? Searche and loke for out of Galile aryseth no Prophet .
43007053	And every man went vnto his awne housse .
43008001	And Iesus went vnto mounte Olivete
43008002	and erly in ye mornynge came agayne into ye temple and all the people came vnto him and he sate doune and taught them .
43008003	And the scribes and ye pharises brought vnto him a woman taken in advoutry and set hyr in the myddes
43008004	and sayde vnto him : Master this woman was taken in advoutry even as the dede was a doyng .
43008005	Moses in the lawe comaunded vs yt suche shuld be stoned . What sayest thou therfore ?
43008006	And this they sayde to tempt him : that they myght have wherof to accuse him . Iesus stouped doune and with his fynger wrote on the grounde .
43008007	And whyll they continued axynge him he lyfte him selfe vp and sayde vnto them : let him yt is amoge you wt out synne cast the fyrst stone at her .
43008008	And agayne he stouped doune and wrote on ye grounde .
43008009	And assone as they hearde that they went out one by one the eldest fyrst . And Iesus was lefte a lone and the woman stondynge in ye myddes .
43008010	When Iesus had lyfte vp him selfe agayne and sawe no man but the woman he sayde vnto hyr . Woman where are those thyne accusars ? Hath no man condempned the ?
43008011	She sayde : No man Lorde . And Iesus sayde : Nether do I condempne the . Goo and synne no moare .
43008012	Then spake Iesus agayne vnto them sayinge : I am the light of the worlde . He that foloweth me shall not walke in darcknes : but shall have the light of lyfe .
43008013	The pharises sayde vnto him : thou bearest recorde of thy sylfe thy recorde is not true .
43008014	Iesus answered and sayde vnto them : Though I beare recorde of my selfe yet my recorde is true : for I knowe whece I came and whyther I goo . But ye cannot tell whece I come and whyther I goo .
43008015	Ye iudge after ye flesshe . I iudge no man
43008016	though I iudge yet is my iudgmet true . For I am not alone : but I and the father that sent me .
43008017	It is also written in youre lawe that the testimony of two men is true .
43008018	I am one yt beare witnes of my selfe and the father that sent me beareth witnes of me .
43008019	Then sayde they vnto him : where is thy father ? Iesus answered : ye nether knowe me nor yet my father . Yf ye had knowen me ye shuld have knowen my father also .
43008020	These wordes spake Iesus in the tresury as he taught in the temple and no man layde hondes on him for his tyme was not yet come .
43008021	Then sayde Iesus agayne vnto them . I goo my waye and ye shall seke me and shall dye in youre synnes . Whyther I goo thyther can ye not come .
43008022	Then sayde the Iewes : will he kyll him selfe because he sayth : whyther I goo thyther can ye not come ?
43008023	And he sayde vnto the : ye are fro beneth I am from above . Ye are of this worlde I am not of this worlde .
43008024	I sayde therfore vnto you that ye shall dye in youre synnes . For except ye beleve that I am he ye shall dye in youre synnes .
43008025	Then sayde they vnto him who arte thou ? And Iesus sayde vnto them : Even ye very same thinge yt I saye vnto you .
43008026	I have many thinges to saye and to iudge of you . But he yt sent me is true . And I speake in ye worlde those thinges which I have hearde of him .
43008027	They understode not that he spake of his father .
43008028	Then sayde Iesus vnto them : when ye have lyft vp an hye the sonne of man then shall ye knowe that I am he and that I do nothinge of my selfe : but as my father hath taught me even so I speake :
43008029	and he that sent me is with me . The father hath not lefte me alone for I do alwayes those thinges that please him .
43008030	As he spake these wordes many beleved on him .
43008031	Then sayde Iesus to those Iewes which beleved on him . If ye cotinue in my wordes then are ye my very disciples
43008032	and shall knowe the trueth : and the trueth shall make you free .
43008033	They answered him : We be Abrahams seede and were never bonde to eny man : why sayest thou then ye shalbe made fre .
43008034	Iesus answered them : verely verely I saye vnto you that whosoever committeth synne is the servaunt of synne .
43008035	And the servaunt abydeth not in the housse for ever : But ye sonne abydeth ever .
43008036	If the sonne therfore shall make you fre then are ye fre in dede .
43008037	I knowe that ye are Abrahams seed : But ye seke meanes to kyll me because my sayinges have no place in you .
43008038	I speake that I have sene with my father : and ye do that which ye have sene with youre father .
43008039	They answered and sayde vnto him : Abraham is oure father . Iesus sayde vnto them . If ye were Abrahams chyldren ye wolde do the dedes of Abraham .
43008040	But now ye goo about io kyll me a man that have tolde you the truthe which I have herde of god : this dyd not Abraham .
43008041	Ye do the dedes of youre father . Then sayde they vnto him : we were not borne of fornicacion . We have one father which is God .
43008042	Iesus sayde vnto them : yf God were youre father then wolde ye love me . For I proceaded forthe and come from God . Nether came I of my selfe but he sent me .
43008043	Why do ye not knowe my speache ? Even because ye cannot abyde the hearynge of my wordes .
43008044	Ye are of youre father the devyll and the lustes of youre father ye will folowe . He was a murtherer from the beginnynge and aboode not in the trueth because ther is no trueth in him . When he speaketh a lye then speaketh he of his awne . For he is a lyar and the father therof .
43008045	And because I tell you ye trueth therfore ye beleve me not .
43008046	Which of you can rebuke me of synne ? If I saye ye trueth why do not ye beleve me ?
43008047	He that is of God heareth goddes wordes Ye therfore heare them not because ye are not of God .
43008048	Then answered the Iewes and sayde vnto him : Saye we not well that thou arte a Samaritane and hast the devyll ?
43008049	Iesus answered : I have not the devyll : but I honour my father and ye have dishonoured me .
43008050	I seke not myne awne prayse : but ther is one that seketh and iudgeth .
43008051	Verely verely I saye vnto you yf a man kepe my sayinges he shall never se deeth .
43008052	Then sayde the Iewes to him : Now knowe we that thou hast the devyll . Abraha is deed and also the Prophetes : and yet thou sayest yf a man kepe my sayinge he shall never tast of deeth .
43008053	Arte thou greater then oure father Abraham which is deed ? and the Prophetes are deed . Whome makest thou thy selfe ?
43008054	Iesus answered : Yf I honoure my selfe myne honoure is nothinge worth . It is my father that honoureth me which ye saye is youre God
43008055	and ye have not knowen him : but I knowe him . And yf I shuld saye I knowe him not I shuld be a lyar lyke vnto you . But I knowe him and kepe his sayinge .
43008056	Youre father Abraham was glad to se my daye and he sawe it and reioysed .
43008057	Then sayde the Iewes vnto him : thou arte not yet . l . yere olde and hast thou sene Abraham ?
43008058	Iesus sayd vnto them : Verely verely I saye vnto you : yer Abraham was I am .
43008059	Then toke they vp stones to caste at him . But Iesus hid him selfe and went out of ye temple .
43009001	And as Iesus passed by he sawe a man which was blynde from his birth .
43009002	And his disciples axed him sayinge . Master who dyd synne : this man or his father and mother that he was borne blynde ?
43009003	Iesus answered : Nether hath this man synned nor yet his father and mother : but that the workes of God shuld be shewed on him .
43009004	I must worke the workes of him that sent me whyll it is daye . The nyght cometh when no man can worke .
43009005	As longe as I am in the worlde I am the lyght of the worlde .
43009006	Assone as he had thus spoken he spate on the grounde and made claye of the spetle and rubbed the claye on the eyes of the blynde
43009007	and sayde vnto him : Goo wesshe the in ye pole of Syloe which by interpretacion signifieth sent . He went his waye and wasshed and cam agayne seinge .
43009008	The neghboures and they that had sene him before how that he was a begger sayde : is not this he that sate and begged ?
43009009	Some sayde : this is he . Other sayd : he is lyke him . But he him selfe sayde : I am even he .
43009010	They sayde vnto him : How are thyne eyes opened then ?
43009011	He answered and sayde . The ma that is called Iesus made claye and anoynted myne eyes and sayd vnto me : Goo to the pole Syloe and wesshe . I went and wesshed and receaved my syght .
43009012	They sayde vnto him : where is he ? He sayde : I cannot tell .
43009013	Then brought they to ye pharises him that a lytell before was blynde :
43009014	for it was the Saboth daye when Iesus made the claye and opened his eyes .
43009015	Then agayne the pharises also axed him how he had receaved his syght . He sayde vnto the : He put claye apon myne eyes and I wasshed and do se .
43009016	Then sayde some of the pharises : this man is not of God because he kepeth not the saboth daye . Other sayde : how can a man yt is a synner do suche myracles ? And ther was stryfe amonge the .
43009017	Then spake they vnto the blynde agayne : What sayst thou of him because he hath openned thyne eyes ? And he sayd : He is a Prophet .
43009018	But the Iewes dyd not beleve of the felowe how that he was blynde and receaved his syght vntyll they had called the father and mother of him that had receaved his syght .
43009019	And they axed the saying : Is this youre sonne whome ye saye was borne blynde ? How doth he now se then ?
43009020	His father and mother answered them and sayde : we wote well that this is oure sonne and that he was borne blynde :
43009021	but by what meanes he now seith that can we not tell or who hath opened his eyes can we not tell . He is olde ynough axe him let him answer for him selfe .
43009022	Suche wordes spake his father and mother because they feared the Iewes . For the Iewes had conspyred all redy that yf eny man dyd confesse that he was Christ he shuld be excommunicat out of the synagoge .
43009023	Therefore sayde his father and mother : he is olde ynough axe him .
43009024	Then agayne called they the man that was blynde and sayd vnto him : Geve God the prayse : we knowe that this man is a synner .
43009025	He answered and sayde : Whyther he be a synner or noo I cannot tell : One thinge I am sure of that I was blynde and now I se .
43009026	Then sayde they to him agayne . What dyd he to the ? How opened he thyne eyes ?
43009027	He answered them I tolde you yerwhyle and ye dyd not heare . Wherfore wolde ye heare it agayne ? Will ye also be his disciples ?
43009028	Then rated they him and sayde : Thou arte his disciple . We be Moses disciples .
43009029	We are sure that God spake with Moses . This felowe we knowe not from whence he is .
43009030	The man answered and sayde vnto them : this is a merveleous thinge that ye wote not whence he is seinge he hath opened myne eyes .
43009031	For we be sure that God heareth not synners . But yf eny man be a worshipper of God and do his will him heareth he .
43009032	Sence ye worlde beganne was it not hearde yt eny man opened the eyes of one that was borne blynd .
43009033	If this man were not of God he coulde have done no thinge .
43009034	They answered and sayd vnto him : thou arte altogeder borne in synne : and dost thou teache vs ? And they cast him out .
43009035	Iesus hearde that they had excommunicate him : and assone as he had founde him he sayd vnto him : doest thou beleve on the sonne of God ?
43009036	He answered and sayde : Who is it Lorde that I myght beleve on him ?
43009037	And Iesus sayde vnto him : Thou hast sene him and he it is that talketh with the .
43009038	And he sayde : Lorde I beleve : and worshipped him .
43009039	Iesus sayde : I am come vnto iudgement into this worlde : that they which se not myght se and they which se myght be made blynde .
43009040	And some of the pharises which were with him hearde these wordes and sayde vnto him : are we then blynde ?
43009041	Iesus sayde vnto them : yf ye were blynde ye shuld have no synne . But now ye saye we se therfore youre synne remayneth .
43010001	Verely verely I saye vnto you : he that entreth not in by ye dore into the shepefolde but clymeth vp some other waye : the same is a thefe and a robber .
43010002	He that goeth in by ye dore is the shepeherde of ye shepe :
43010003	to him the porter openeth and the shepe heare his voyce and he calleth his awne shepe by name and leadeth them out .
43010004	And when he hath sent forthe his awne shepe he goeth before them and the shepe folowe him : for they knowe his voyce .
43010005	A straunger they will not folowe but will flye from him : for they knowe not the voyce of straungers .
43010006	This similitude spake Iesus vnto them . But they vnderstode not what thinges they were which he spake vnto them .
43010007	Then sayde Iesus vnto them agayne . Verely verely I saye vnto you : I am the dore of the shepe .
43010008	All even as many as came before me are theves and robbers : but the shepe dyd not heare them .
43010009	I am the dore : by me yf eny man enter in he shalbe safe and shall goo in and out and fynde pasture .
43010010	The thefe cometh not but forto steale kyll and destroye . I am come that they myght have lyfe and have it more aboundantly .
43010011	I am ye good shepeheerd . The good shepeheerd geveth his lyfe for ye shepe .
43010012	An heyred servaut which is not ye shepeherd nether ye shepe are his awne seith the wolfe comynge and leveth the shepe and flyeth and the wolfe catcheth them and scattereth ye shepe .
43010013	The heyred servaut flyeth because he is an heyred servaunt and careth not for the shepe .
43010014	I am that good shepeheerd and knowe myne and am knowe of myne .
43010015	As my father knoweth me : even so knowe I my father . And I geve my lyfe for the shepe :
43010016	and other shepe I have which are not of this folde . Them also must I bringe that they maye heare my voyce and that ther maye be one flocke and one shepeherde .
43010017	Therfore doth my father love me because I put my lyfe from me that I myght take it agayne .
43010018	No man taketh it from me : but I put it awaye of my selfe . I have power to put it from me and have power to take it agayne : This comaundment have I receaved of my father .
43010019	And ther was a dissencion agayne amoge the Iewes for these sayinges
43010020	and many of them sayd . He hath the devyll and is mad : why heare ye him ?
43010021	Other sayde these are not the wordes of him that hath the devyll . Can the devyll open the eyes of the blynde ?
43010022	And it was at Ierusalem ye feaste of the dedicacion and it was wynter :
43010023	and Iesus walked in Salomons porche .
43010024	Then came the Iewes rounde aboute him and sayde vnto him : How longe dost thou make vs doute ? Yf thou be Christ tell vs playnly .
43010025	Iesus answered them : I tolde you and ye beleve not . The workes yt I do in my fathers name they beare witnes of me .
43010026	But ye beleve not because ye are not of my shepe . As I sayde vnto you :
43010027	my shepe heare my voyce and I knowe them and they folowe me
43010028	and I geve vnto the eternall lyfe and they shall never perisshe nether shall eny man plucke the oute of my honde .
43010029	My father which gave the me is greatter then all and no man is able to take them out of my fathers honde .
43010030	And I and my father are one .
43010031	Then the Iewes agayne toke up stones to stone him with all .
43010032	Iesus answered them : many good workes have I shewed you from my father : for which of them will ye stone me ?
43010033	The Iewes answered him sayinge . For thy good workes sake we stone ye not : but for thy blasphemy and because that thou beinge a man makest thy selfe God .
43010034	Iesus answered them : Is it not written in youre lawe : I saye ye are goddes ?
43010035	If he called the goddes vnto whom the worde of God was spoken ( and the scripture can not be broken )
43010036	saye ye then to him whom the father hath sainctified and sent into the worlde thou blasphemest because I sayd I am the sonne of God ?
43010037	If I do not the workes of my father beleve me not .
43010038	But if I do though ye beleve not me yet beleve the workes that ye maye knowe and beleve that the father is in me and I in him .
43010039	Agayne they went aboute to take him : but he escaped out of their hondes
43010040	and went awaye agayne beyonde Iordan into the place where Iohn before had baptised and there aboode .
43010041	And many resorted vnto him and sayd . Iohn dyd no miracle : but all thinges that Iohn spake of this man are true .
43010042	And many beleved on him theare .
43011001	A certayne man was sicke named Lazarus of Bethania the toune of Mary and her sister Martha .
43011002	It was that Mary which annoynted Iesus with oyntment and wyped his fete with her heere whose brother Lazarus was sicke
43011003	and his sisters sent vnto him sayinge . Lorde behold he whom thou lovest is sicke .
43011004	When Iesus hearde yt he sayd : this infirmite is not vnto deth but for ye laude of God that the sonne of God myght be praysed by the reason of it .
43011005	Iesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
43011006	After he hearde that he was sicke then aboode he two dayes still in the same place where he was .
43011007	Then after that sayd he to his disciples : let us goo into Iewry agayne .
43011008	His disciples sayde vnto him . Master the Iewes lately sought meanes to stone the and wilt thou goo thyther agayne ?
43011009	Iesus answered : are ther not twelve houres in ye daye ? Yf a man walke in ye daye he stombleth not because he seith the lyght of this worlde .
43011010	But yf a ma walke in ye nyght he stombleth because ther is no lyght in him .
43011011	This sayde he and after yt he sayde vnto the : oure frende Lazarus slepeth but I goo to wake him out of slepe .
43011012	Then sayde his disciples : Lorde yf he slepe he shall do well ynough .
43011013	How be it Iesus spake of his deeth : but they thought yt he had spoke of ye naturall slepe .
43011014	Then sayde Iesus vnto the playnly Lazarus is deed
43011015	and I am glad for youre sakes yt I was not there because ye maye beleve . Neverthelesse let vs go vnto him .
43011016	Then sayde Thomas which is called Dydimus vnto ye disciples : let vs also goo that we maye dye wt him
43011017	Then went Iesus and founde that he had lyne in his grave foure dayes already .
43011018	Bethanie was nye vnto Ierusalem aboute . xv . furlonges of
43011019	and many of the Iewes were come to Martha and Mary to comforte them over their brother .
43011020	Martha assone as she hearde yt Iesus was comynge went and met him : but Mary sate still in the housse .
43011021	Then sayde Martha vnto Iesus : Lorde yf thou haddest bene here my brother had not bene deed :
43011022	but neverthelesse I knowe that whatsoever thou axest of God God will geve it the .
43011023	Iesus sayde vnto her : Thy brother shall ryse agayne .
43011024	Martha sayde vnto him : I knowe that he shall ryse agayne in the resurreccion at the last daye .
43011025	Iesus sayde vnto her : I am the resurreccion and the lyfe : He that beleveth on me ye though he were deed yet shall he lyve .
43011026	And whosoever lyveth and belevest on me shall never dye . Beleveth thou this ?
43011027	She sayde vnto him : ye Lorde I beleve that thou arte Christ the sonne of god which shuld come into the worlde .
43011028	And assone as she had so sayde she went her waye and called Marie her sister secretly sayinge : The master is come and calleth for the
43011029	And she assone as she hearde that arose quickly and came vnto him .
43011030	Iesus was not yet come into the toune : but was in the place where Martha met him .
43011031	The Iewes then which were with her in the housse and comforted her when they sawe Mary that she rose vp hastely and went out folowed her saying : She goeth vnto the grave to wepe there .
43011032	Then when Mary was come where Iesus was and sawe him she fell doune at his fete sayinge vnto him : Lorde yf thou haddest bene here my brother had not bene deed .
43011033	When Iesus sawe her wepe and ye Iewes also wepe which came wt her he groned in ye sprete and was troubled in him selfe
43011034	and sayde : Where have ye layed him ? They sayde vnto him : Lorde come and se .
43011035	And Iesus wept .
43011036	Then sayde the Iewes : Beholde howe he loved him .
43011037	And some of the sayde : coulde not he which openned the eyes of the blynde have made also that this man shuld not have dyed ?
43011038	Iesus agayne groned in him selfe and came to the grave . It was a caue and a stone layde on it .
43011039	And Iesus sayd : take ye awaye the stone . Martha the sister of him that was deed sayd vnto him : Lorde by this tyme he stinketh . For he hath bene deed foure dayes :
43011040	Iesus sayde vnto her : Sayde I not vnto the yt if thou didest beleve thou shuldest se ye glory of God .
43011041	Then they toke awaye ye stone from ye place where the deed was layde . And Iesus lyfte vp his eyes and sayde : Father I thanke the because that thou hast hearde me .
43011042	I wot that thou hearest me all wayes : but because of the people that stonde by I sayde it yt they maye beleve that thou hast sent me .
43011043	And when he thus had spoken he cryed wt a loud voyce . Lazarus come forthe .
43011044	And he that was deed came forth bounde hand and fote with grave bondes and his face was bounde with a napkin . Iesus sayde vnto the : loowse him and let him goo .
43011045	Then many of the Iewes which came to Mary and had sene the thinges which Iesus dyd beleved on him .
43011046	But some of them went their wayes to the Pharises and tolde them what Iesus had done .
43011047	Then gadered the hye prestes and the Pharises a counsell and sayde : what do we ? This ma doeth many miracles .
43011048	Yf we let him scape thus all men will beleve on him and ye Romaynes shall come and take awaye oure countre and the people .
43011049	And one of them named Cayphas which was the hieprest yt same yeare sayde vnto them : Ye perceave nothinge at all
43011050	nor yet consider that it is expedient for vs that one man dye for the people and not that all the people perisshe .
43011051	This spake he not of him selfe but beinge hye preste that same yeare he prophesied that Iesus shulde dye for the people
43011052	and not for the people only but that he shuld gader to geder in one the chyldren of God which were scattered abroode .
43011053	From that daye forth they held a counsell to geder for to put him to deeth .
43011054	Iesus therfore walked no more opely amoge the Iewes : but wet his waye thence vnto a coutre nye to a wildernes into a cite called Ephraim and there hauted with his disciples .
43011055	And the Iewes ester was nye at hand and many went out of the countre vp to Ierusalem before the ester to purify them selves .
43011056	Then sought they for Iesus and spake bitwene the selves as they stode in the teple : What thinke ye seynge he cometh not to the feast .
43011057	The hye prestes and Pharises had geven a comaundemet that yf eny man knew where he were he shuld shewe it that they myght take him .
43012001	Then Iesus sixe dayes before ester came to Bethany where Lazarus was which was deed and who Iesus raysed from deeth .
43012002	There they made him a supper and Martha served : But Lazarus was one of them that sate at the table with him .
43012003	Then toke Mary a pounde of oyntmet called Nardus perfecte and precious and anoynted Iesus fete and wipt his fete with her heer and the housse was filled of the savre of the oyntmet .
43012004	Then sayde one of his disciples name Iudas Iscariot Simos sonne which afterwarde betrayed him :
43012005	why was not this oyntmet solde for thre hondred pence and geve to the poore ?
43012006	This sayde he not that he cared for the pooer : but because he was a thefe and kept the bagge and bare that which was geven .
43012007	Then sayde Iesus : Let her alone agaynst the daye of my buryinge she kept it .
43012008	The poore all wayes shall ye have with you but me shall ye not all wayes have .
43012009	Moche people of the Iewes had knowledge that he was there . And they came not for Iesus sake only but yt they myght se Lazarus also whom he raysed from deeth .
43012010	The hye prestes therfore held a counsell that they myght put Lazarus to deeth also
43012011	because that for his sake many of the Iewes went awaye and beleved on Iesus .
43012012	On the morowe moche people that were come to the feast when they hearde yt Iesus shuld come to Ierusalem
43012013	toke braunches of palme trees and went and met him and cryed : Hosanna blessed is he that in the name of the Lorde commeth kynge of Israel .
43012014	And Iesus got a yonge asse and sate thero accordinge to that which was writte :
43012015	feare not doughter of Sio beholde thy kynge cometh sittinge on an asses coolte .
43012016	These thinges vnderstode not his disciples at ye fyrst : but when Iesus was gloryfied then remembryd they that soche thinges were written of him and that soche thinges they had done vnto him .
43012017	The people that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave and raysed him from deeth bare recorde .
43012018	Therfore met him the people be cause they hearde yt he had done soche a myracle .
43012019	The Pharises therfore sayde amonge them selves : perceave ye how we prevayle no thinge ? beholde the worlde goth awaye after him .
43012020	Ther were certayne Grekes amoge them that came to praye at the feast :
43012021	the same cam to Philip which was of Bethsayda a cyte in Galile and desired him sayinge : Syr we wolde fayne se Iesus .
43012022	Philip came and tolde Andrew . And agayne Andrew and Philip tolde Iesus .
43012023	And Iesus answered them sayinge : the houre is come yt the sonne of ma must be glorified .
43012024	Verely verely I saye vnto you except ye wheate corne fall into the grounde and dye it bydeth alone . Yf it dye it brengeth forth moche frute .
43012025	He that loveth his lyfe shall destroye it : and he yt hateth his lyfe in this worlde shall kepe it vnto lyfe eternall .
43012026	If eny man mynister vnto me let him folowe me and where I am there shall also my minister be . And yf eny man minister vnto me him will my father honoure .
43012027	Now is my soule troubled and what shall I saye ? Father delyver me from this houre : but therfore came I vnto this houre
43012028	Father glorify thy name . Then came ther a voyce fro heaven : I have glorified it and will glorify it agayne .
43012029	Then sayd the people yt stode by and hearde : it thoundreth . Other sayde an angell spake to him .
43012030	Iesus answered and sayde : this voyce cam not because of me but for youre sakes .
43012031	Now is the iudgement of this worlde : now shall ye prince of this worlde be cast out .
43012032	And I yf I were lifte vp from the erthe will drawe all men vnto me .
43012033	This sayde Iesus signifyinge what deeth he shuld dye .
43012034	The people answered him : We have hearde of ye lawe yt Christ bydeth ever : and how sayest thou then that the sonne of man must be lifte vp ? who is yt sonne of ma ?
43012035	Then Iesus sayde vnto them : yet a lytell whyle is the light wt you . Walke whill ye have light lest the darcknes come on you . He that walketh in the darke wotteth not whither he goeth .
43012036	Whyll ye have light beleve on the light that ye maye be the chyldren of light . These thinges spake Iesus and departed and hyd him silfe fro them .
43012037	And though he had done so many myracles before them yet beleved not they on him
43012038	yt the sayinge of Esayas the Prophet myght be fulfilled yt he spake . Lorde who shall beleve oure sayinge ? And to whom ys the arme of ye Lorde opened ?
43012039	Therfore coulde they not beleve because yt Esaias sayth agayne :
43012040	he hath blinded their eyes and hardened their hertes that they shuld not se with their eyes and vnderstonde with their hertes and shuld be converted and I shuld heale the .
43012041	Soche thinges sayde Esaias when he sawe his glory and spake of him .
43012042	Neverthelesse amoge ye chefe rulers many beleved on him . But because of the pharises they wolde not be a knowen of it lest they shuld be excommunicate .
43012043	For they loved the prayse yt is geven of men more then the prayse that cometh of God .
43012044	And Iesus cryed and sayde : he that beleveth on me beleveth not on me but on him yt sent me .
43012045	And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me .
43012046	I am come a light into the worlde that whosoever beleveth on me shuld not byde in darcknes .
43012047	And yf eny man heare my wordes and beleve not I iudge him not . For I came not to iudge the worlde : but to save ye worlde .
43012048	He that refuseth me and receaveth not my wordes hath one that iudgeth him . The wordes that I have spoken they shall iudge him in ye last daye .
43012049	For I have not spoken of my selfe : but the father which sent me he gave me a commaundemet what I shuld saye and what I shuld speake .
43012050	And I knowe that this comaundement is lyfe everlastinge . Whatsoever I speake therfore eve as the father bade me so I speake .
43013001	Before the feast of ester whe Iesus knewe that his houre was come that he shuld departe out of this worlde vnto the father . When he loved his which were in the worlde vnto the ende he loved the .
43013002	And when supper was ended after that the devyll had put in the hert of Iudas Iscariot Simos sonne to betraye him :
43013003	Iesus knowinge that the father had geve all thinges into his hondes . And that he was come from God and went to God
43013004	he rose from supper and layde a syde his vpper garmentes and toke a towell and gyrd him selfe .
43013005	After that poured he water into a basyn and beganne to wash his disciples fete and to wype them with the towell wherwith he was gyrde .
43013006	Then came he to Simon Peter . And Peter sayde to him : Lorde shalt thou wesshe my fete ?
43013007	Iesus answered and sayde vnto him : what I do thou wotest not now but thou shalt knowe herafter .
43013008	Peter sayd vnto him : thou shalt not wesshe my fete whill ye worlde stondeth . Iesus answered him : yf I wasshe ye not thou shalt have no part with me .
43013009	Simon Peter sayde vnto him : Lorde not my fete only : but also my handes and my heed .
43013010	Iesus sayde to him : he that is wesshed nedeth not save to wesshe his fete and is clene every whit . And ye are clene : but not all .
43013011	For he knewe his betrayer . Therfore sayde he : ye are not all clene .
43013012	After he had wesshed their fete and receaved his clothes and was set doune agayne he sayde vnto them ? wot ye what I have done to you ?
43013013	Ye call me master and Lorde and ye saye well for so am I .
43013014	If I then youre Lorde and master have wesshed youre fete ye also ought to wesshe one anothers fete .
43013015	For I have geven you an ensample that ye shuld do as I have done to you .
43013016	Verely verely I saye vnto you the servaunt is not greater then his master nether the messenger greater then he that sent him .
43013017	If ye vnderstonde these thinges happy are ye yf ye do them .
43013018	I speake not of you all I knowe whom I have chosen . But that ye scripture be fulfilled : he that eateth breed wt me hath lyfte vp his hele agaynste me .
43013019	Now tell I you before it come : that when it is come to passe ye might beleve that I am he .
43013020	Verely verely I saye vnto you . He that receaveth who soever I sende receaveth me . And he that receaveth me receaveth him that sent me .
43013021	When Iesus had thus sayd he was troubled in the sprete and testified sayinge : verely verely I saye vnto you that one of you shall betraye me .
43013022	And then the disciples loked one on another doutinge of who he spake .
43013023	Ther was one of his disciples which leaned on Iesus bosome whom Iesus loved .
43013024	To him beckened Simo Peter that he shuld axe who it was of whom he spake .
43013025	He then as he leaned on Iesus brest sayde vnto him : Lorde who ys it ?
43013026	Iesus answered he yt ys to whom I geve a soppe when I have dept it . And he wet a soppe and gave it to Iudas Iscarioth Simons sonne .
43013027	And after the soppe Satan entred into him . Then sayd Iesus vnto him : that thou dost do quickly .
43013028	That wist no ma at the table for what intent he spake vnto him .
43013029	Some of the thought because Iudas had the bagge that Iesus had sayd vnto him bye those thinges that we have nede af agaynst ye feast : or that he shulde geve some thinge to the poore .
43013030	Assone then as he had receaved the soppe he wet immediatly out . And it was night .
43013031	Whe he was gone out Iesus sayde : now is the sonne of man glorified . And God is glorified by him .
43013032	Yf God be glorified by him God shall also glorify him in him selfe : and shall strayght waye glorify him .
43013033	Deare chyldren yet a lytell whyle am I with you . Ye shall seke me and as I sayde vnto the Iewes whither I goo thither can ye not come . Also to you saye I nowe .
43013034	A newe commaundment geve I vnto you that ye love to gedder as I have loved you that even so ye love one another .
43013035	By this shall all me knowe yt ye are my disciples yf ye shall have love one to another .
43013036	Simon Peter sayd vnto him : Lorde whither goest thou ? Iesus answered him : whither I goo thou canst not folowe me now but thou shalt folowe me afterwardes .
43013037	Peter sayd vnto him : Lorde why canot I folowe the now ? I will geve my lyfe for thy sake ?
43013038	Iesus answered him : wilt thou geve thy lyfe for my sake ? Verely verely I saye vnto the the cocke shall not crowe tyll thou have denyed me thryse .
43014001	And he sayd vnto his disciples : Let not youre hertes be troubled . Beleve in god and beleve in me .
43014002	In my fathers housse are many mansions . If it were not so I wolde have tolde you . I go to prepare a place for you .
43014003	And yf I go to prepare a place for you I will come agayne and receave you eve vnto my selfe yt where I am there maye ye be also .
43014004	And whither I go ye knowe and ye waye ye knowe .
43014005	Thomas sayde vnto him : Lorde we knowe not whyther thou goest . Also how is it possible for vs to knowe the waye ?
43014006	Iesus sayd vnto him : I am ye waye ye truthe and ye life . And no man cometh vnto the father but by me .
43014007	Yf ye had knowe me ye had knowe my father also . And now ye knowe him and have sene him .
43014008	Philip sayd vnto him : Lorde shew vs the father and it suffiseth vs .
43014009	Iesus sayde vnto him : have I bene so longe tyme wt you : and yet hast thou not knowen me ? Philip he yt hath sene me hath sene ye father . And how sayest thou then : shew vs the father ?
43014010	Belevest thou not that I am in ye father and the father in me ? The wordes that I speake vnto you I speakee not of my selfe : but ye father that dwelleth in me is he that doeth ye workes .
43014011	Beleve me that I am the father and ye father in me . At the leest beleve me for the very workes sake .
43014012	Verely verely I saye vnto you : he that beleveth on me the workes that I doo the same shall he do and greater workes then these shall he do because I go vnto my father .
43014013	And what soever ye axe in my name yt will I do yt the father might be glorified by the sonne .
43014014	Yf ye shall axe eny thige in my name I will do it
43014015	If ye love me kepe my comaundementes
43014016	and I will praye the father and he shall geve you a nother comforter yt he maye byde with you ever
43014017	which is the sprete of truthe whome the worlde canot receave because the worlde seyth him not nether knoweth him . But ye knowe him . For he dwelleth with you and shalbe in you .
43014018	I will not leave you comfortlesse : but will come vnto you .
43014019	Yet a litell whyle and the worlde seith me no moare : but ye shall se me . For I live and ye shall live .
43014020	That daye shall ye knowe that I am in my father and you in me and I in you
43014021	He that hath my comaundemetes and kepeth them the same is he that loveth me . And he yt loveth me shall be loved of my father : and I will love him and will shewe myne awne selfe vnto him .
43014022	Iudas sayde vnto him ( not Iudas Iscarioth ) Lorde what is the cause that thou wilt shewe thy selfe vnto vs and not vnto the worlde ?
43014023	Iesus answered and sayde vnto him : yf a man love me and wyll kepe my sayinges my father also will love him and we will come vnto him and will dwelle with him .
43014024	He that loveth me not kepeth not my sayinges . And the wordes which ye heare are not myne but the fathers which sent me .
43014025	This have I spoken vnto you beynge yet present with you .
43014026	But that coforter which is the holy gost ( whom my father will sende in my name ) he shall teache you all thinges and bringe all thinges to youre remembraunce whatsoever I have tolde you .
43014027	Peace I leve with you my peace I geve vnto you . Not as the worlde geveth geve I vnto you . Let not youre hertes be greved nether feare ye .
43014028	Ye have hearde how I sayde vnto you : I go and come agayne vnto you . If ye loved me ye wolde verely reioyce because I sayde I go vnto ye father . For ye father is greater then I
43014029	And now have I shewed you before it come yt whe it is come to passe ye might beleve .
43014030	Here after will I not talke many mordes vnto you . For the rular of this worlde commeth and hath nought in me .
43014031	But that the worlde maye knowe that I love the father : therfore as the father gave me comaundment even so do I . Ryse let vs go hence .
43015001	I am the true vyne and my father ys an husbande man .
43015002	Every braunche that beareth not frute in me he will take awaye . And every braunche that beareth frute will he pourge yt it maye bringe moare frute .
43015003	Now are ye cleane thorow ye wordes which I have spoke vnto you .
43015004	Byde in me and let me byde in you . As ye braunche canot beare frute of it sylfe excepte it byde in the vyne : no more can ye excepte ye abyde in me .
43015005	I am the vyne and ye are the braunches . He that abydeth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth moche frute . For with out me can ye do nothinge .
43015006	Yf a man byde not in me he ys cast forthe as a braunche and is wyddered : and men gadder it and cast it into the fyre and it burneth .
43015007	Yf ye byde in me and my wordes also byde in you : axe what ye will and it shalbe done to you .
43015008	Heare in is my father glorified that ye beare moche frute and be made my disciples .
43015009	As the father hath loved me eve so have I leved you . Continue in my love .
43015010	Yf ye shall kepe my comaudemetes ye shall byde in my love eve as I have kept my fathers comaundementes and byde in his love .
43015011	These thinges have I spoken vnto you yt my ioye myght remayne in you and that youre ioye might be full .
43015012	This is my commaundement that ye love togedder as I have loved you .
43015013	Gretter love then this hath no man then that a man bestowe his lyfe for his frendes .
43015014	Ye are my fredes yf ye do whatsoever I commaunde you .
43015015	Hence forth call I you not servauntes : for the servaunt knoweth not what his Lorde doeth . But you have I called frendes : for all thinges that I have hearde of my father I have opened to you .
43015016	Ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordeyned you that ye go and bringe forthe frute and that youre frute remayne that whatsoever ye shall axe of the father in my name he shulde geve it you .
43015017	This comaunde I you that ye love to gedder .
43015018	Yf ye worlde hate you ye knowe that he hated me before he hated you .
43015019	Yf ye were of the worlde ye worlde wolde love his awne . How be it because ye are not of ye worlde but I have chosen you out of the worlde therfore hateth you the worlde .
43015020	Remember the sayinge that I sayde vnto you : the servaute is not greater then his lorde . Yf they have persecuted me so will they persecute you Yf they have kept my sayinge so will they kepe youres .
43015021	But all these thinges will they do vnto you for my names sake because they have not knowen him that sent me .
43015022	If I had not come and spoken vnto them they shulde not have had synne : but now have they nothinge to cloke their synne with all .
43015023	He that hateth me hateth my father .
43015024	If I had not done workes amoge the which none other ma dyd they had not had synne . But now have they sene and yet have hated bothe me and my father :
43015025	eve that the sayinge myght be fulfilled that is written in theyr lawe : they hated me wtout a cause .
43015026	But when the comforter is come whom I will sende vnto you fro the father which is the sprete of truthe which proceadeth of the father he shall testifie of me .
43015027	And ye shall beare witnes also because ye have bene with me from the begynninge .
43016001	These thinges have I sayde vnto you because ye shuld not be offended .
43016002	They shall excomunicat you : ye ye tyme shall come that whosoever killeth you will thinke that he doth God service .
43016003	And suche thinges will they do vnto you because they have not knowen the father nether yet me .
43016004	But these thinges have I tolde you that when that houre is come ye myght remember them that I tolde you so . These thinges sayde I not unto you at the begynninge because I was present with you .
43016005	But now I goo my waye to him that sent me and none of you axeth me : whither goest thou ?
43016006	But because I have sayde suche thinges vnto you youre hertes are full of sorowe .
43016007	Neverthelesse I tell you the trueth it is expedient for you that I goo awaye . For yf I goo not awaye that comforter will not come vnto you . But yf I departe I will sende him vnto you .
43016008	And when he is come he will rebuke ye worlde of synne and of rightwesnes and of iudgement .
43016009	Of synne because they beleve not on me :
43016010	Of rightwesnes because I go to my father and ye shall se me no moare :
43016011	and of iudgement because the chefe ruler of this worlde is iudged all ready .
43016012	I have yet many thinges to saye vnto you : but ye canot beare them awaye now .
43016013	How be it when he is come ( I meane the sprete of truthe ) he will leade yon into all trueth . He shall not speake of him selfe : but whatsoever he shall heare that shall he speake and he will shewe you thinges to come .
43016014	He shall glorify me for he shall receave of myne and shall shewe vnto you .
43016015	All thinges that ye father hath aremyne . Therfore sayd I vnto you that he shall take of myne and shewe vnto you .
43016016	After a whyle ye shall not se me and agayne after a whyle ye shall se me : For I goo to the father .
43016017	Then sayd some of his disciples bitwene them selves : what is this yt he sayth vnto vs after a whyle ye shall not se me and agayne after a whyle ye shall se me : and that I go to the father .
43016018	They sayd therfore : what is this that he sayth after a whyle ? we canot tell what he sayth .
43016019	Iesus perceaved yt they wolde axe him and sayd vnto them : This is it that ye enquyre of bitwene youre selves that I sayd after a whyle ye shall not se me and agayne after a whyle ye shall se me .
43016020	Verely verely I saye vnto you : ye shall wepe and lamet and the worlde shall reioyce . Ye shall sorowe : but youre sorowe shalbe tourned to ioye .
43016021	A woman when she traveyleth hath sorowe because her houre is come : but assone as she is delivered of the chylde she remembreth no moare the anguysshe for ioye that a man is borne in to the worlde .
43016022	And ye now are in sorowe : but I will se you agayne and youre hertes shall reioyce and youre ioye shall no ma take fro you .
43016023	And in that daye shall ye axe me no question . Verely verely I saye vnto you whatsoever ye shall axe the father in my name he will geve it you .
43016024	Hitherto have ye axed nothinge in my name . Axe and ye shall receave it : that youre ioye maye be full .
43016025	These thinges have I spoken vnto you in proverbes . The tyme will come when I shall no moare speake to you in proverbes : but I shall shewe you playnly from my father .
43016026	At that daye shall ye axe in myne name . And I saye not vnto you that I will speake vnto my father for you
43016027	For ye father him selfe loveth you because ye have loved me and have beleved that I came out from God .
43016028	I went out from the father and came into the worlde : and I leve the worlde agayne and go to ye father .
43016029	His disciples sayd vnto him : loo now speakest thou playnly and thou vsest no proverbe .
43016030	Nowe knowe we that thou vnderstondest all thinges and nedest not yt eny man shuld axe the eny question . Therfore beleve we that thou camst fro god .
43016031	Iesus answered them : Now ye do beleve .
43016032	Beholde ye houre draweth nye and is already come yt ye shalbe scatered every man his wayes and shall leave me alone . And yet am I not alone . For ye father is with me .
43016033	These wordes have I spoke vnto you yt in me ye might have peace . For in ye worlde shall ye have tribulacio : but be of good cheare I have over come the worlde .
43017001	These wordes spake Iesus and lyfte vp his eyes to heven and sayde : father the houre is come : glorify thy sonne that thy sonne maye glorify the :
43017002	as thou hast geve him power over all fleshe that he shuld geve eternall lyfe to as many as thou hast geven him .
43017003	This is lyfe eternall that they myght knowe the that only very God and whom thou hast sent Iesus Christ .
43017004	I have glorified ye on the erth . I have fynysshed ye worke which thou gavest me to do .
43017005	And now glorify me thou father wt thyn awne selfe with the glory which I had with ye yerre ye worlde was .
43017006	I have declared thy name vnto ye men which thou gavest me out of the worlde . Thyne they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept thy sayinges .
43017007	Now they knowe that all thinges whatsoever thou hast geven me are of the .
43017008	For I have geven vnto them the wordes which thou gavest me and they have receaved them and knowe surely that I came out from the : and doo beleve that thou dyddest send me .
43017009	I praye for them and praye not for the worlde : but for the which thou hast geve me for they are thyne .
43017010	And all myne are thyne and thyne are myne and I am glorified in the .
43017011	And now am I no moare in the worlde but they are in the worlde and I come to ye . Wholy father kepe in thyne awne name the which thou hast geven me that they maye be one as we are .
43017012	Whyll I was with the in ye worlde I kepte the in thy name . Those yt thou gavest me have I kepte and none of the is lost but that lost chylde that the scripture myght be fulfilled .
43017013	Now come I to the and these wordes speake I in the worlde that they myght have my ioye full in the .
43017014	I have geven them thy wordes and the worlde hath hated them because they are not of the worlde even as I am not of the worlde .
43017015	I desyre not that thou shuldest take the out of the worlde : but that thou kepe them from evyll .
43017016	They are not of the worlde as I am not of the worlde .
43017017	Sanctify the wt thy truth . Thy sayinge is truth .
43017018	As thou dyddest send me into the worlde even so have I sent them into the worlde
43017019	and for their sakes sanctify I my selfe that they also myght be sanctified thorowe the trueth .
43017020	I praye not for them alone : but for them also which shall beleve on me thorowe their preachynge
43017021	that they all maye be one as thou father arte in me and I in the that they maye be also one in vs that the worlde maye beleve that thou hast sent me .
43017022	And that glory that thou gavest me I have geven them that they maye be one as we are wone .
43017023	I in them and thou in me that they maye be made perfecte in one and that the worlde maye knowe that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me .
43017024	Father I will that they which thou hast geven me be with me where I am that they maye se my glory which thou hast geven me . For thou lovedest me before the makynge of the worlde .
43017025	O ryghteous father ye very worlde hath not knowen the : but I have knowen the and these have knowen that thou hast sent me .
43017026	And I have declared vnto them thy name and will declare it that the love wher wt thou hast loved me be in them and that I be in them .
43018001	When Iesus had spoken these wordes he wet forth with his disciples over the broke Cedron where was a garden into the which he entred with his disciples .
43018002	Iudas also which betrayed him knewe the place : for Iesus ofte tymes resorted thyther with his disciples .
43018003	Iudas then after he had receaved abonde of men and ministres of the hye Prestes and Pharises came thyther with lanterns and fyerbrondes and wepens .
43018004	Then Iesus knowynge all thinges that shuld come on him went forth and sayde vnto them : whom seke ye ?
43018005	They answered him : Iesus of Nazareth . Iesus sayde vnto them : I am he . Iudas also which betrayed him stode with them .
43018006	But assone as he had sayd vnto them I am he they went backe wardes and fell to the grounde .
43018007	And he axed the agayne : whome seke ye ? They sayde : Iesus of Nazareth .
43018008	Iesus answered I sayde vnto you I am he . If ye seke me let these goo their waye .
43018009	That ye sayinge might be fulfilled which he spake : of the which thou gavest me have I not lost one .
43018010	Simon Peter had a swearde and drue it and smote the hye prestes servaunt and cut of his ryght eare . The servauntes name was Malchas .
43018011	Then sayde Iesus vnto Peter : put vp thy swearde into ye sheath : shall I not drinke of ye cup which my father hath geven me ?
43018012	Then the copany and the captayne and the ministres of of the Iewes toke Iesus and bounde him
43018013	and led him awaye to Anna fyrst : For he was fatherelawe vnto Cayphas which was ye hye preste that same yeare .
43018014	Cayphas was he that gave counsell to ye Iewes that it was expediet that one man shuld dye for the people .
43018015	And Simon Peter folowed Iesus and another disciple : that disciple was knowen of ye hye preste and went in with Iesus into the pallys of the hye preste .
43018016	But Peter stode at the dore with out . Then went out that other disciple which was knowen vnto the hye preste and spake to the damsell that kept the dore and brought in Peter .
43018017	Then sayde ye damsell that kept the dore vnto Peter : Arte not thou one of this mannes disciples ? He sayde : I am not .
43018018	The servauntes and the ministres stode there and had made a fyre of coles : for it was colde : and they warmed them selves . Peter also stode amonge them and warmed him selfe .
43018019	The hye preste axed Iesus of his disciples and of his doctrine .
43018020	Iesus answered him : I spake openly in ye worlde . I ever taught in ye synagoge and in the temple whyther all ye Iewes resorted and in secrete have I sayde nothynge :
43018021	Why axest thou me ? Axe them whiche hearde me what I sayde vnto the . Beholde they can tell what I sayde .
43018022	Whe he had thus spoken one of ye ministres which stode by smote Iesus on the face sayinge : answerest thou the hyepreste so ?
43018023	Iesus answered him . If I have evyll spoke beare witnes of ye evyll : yf I have well spoke why smytest thou me ?
43018024	And Annas sent him bounde vnto Caiphas ye hye preste .
43018025	Simon Peter stode and warmed him selfe . And they sayde vnto him : arte not thou also one of his disciples ? He denyed it and sayde : I am not .
43018026	One of the servauntes of the hye preste ( his cosyn whose eare Peter smote of ) sayde vnto him : dyd not I se the in the garden with him ?
43018027	Peter denyed it agayne : and immediatly the cocke crewe .
43018028	Then led they Iesus fro Cayphas into the hall of iudgement . It was in the mornynge and they them selves went not into the iudgement hall lest they shuld be defyled but that they myght eate the paschall lambe .
43018029	Pylate then went out vnto the and sayde : what accusacion bringe ye agaynste this man ?
43018030	They answered and sayd vnto him . If he were not an evyll doar we wolde not have delyvered him vnto the .
43018031	Then sayd Pylate vnto the : take ye him and iudge him after youre awne lawe . Then the Iewes sayde vnto him . It is not lawfull for vs to put eny ma to deeth .
43018032	That ye wordes of Iesus myght be fulfilled which he spake signifyinge what deeth he shuld dye .
43018033	Then Pylate entred into the iudgemet hall agayne and called Iesus and sayd vnto him : arte thou the kynge of ye Iewes ?
43018034	Iesus answered : sayst thou that of thy selfe or dyd other tell it the of me ?
43018035	Pylate answered : Am I a Iewe ? Thyne awne nacion and hye prestes have delyvered ye vnto me . What hast thou done ?
43018036	Iesus answered : my kyngdome is not of this worlde . Yf my kyngdome were of this worlde then wolde my ministres suerly fight yt I shuld not be delyvered to ye Iewes but now is my kyngdome not fro hence .
43018037	Pylate sayde vnto him : Arte thou a kynge then ? Iesus answered : Thou sayst yt I am a kynge . For this cause was I borne and for this cause came I into ye worlde yt I shuld beare witnes vnto the trueth . And all that are of ye trueth heare my voyce .
43018038	Pilate sayde vnto him : what thinge is trueth ? And when he had sayd yt he went out agayne vnto the Iewes and sayde vnto them : I fynde in him no cause at all .
43018039	Ye have a custome that I shuld delyver you one lowsse at ester . Will ye that I lowse vnto you the kynge of ye Iewes .
43018040	Then cryed they all agayne sayinge : Not him but Barrabas that Barrabas was a robber .
43019001	Then Pylate toke Iesus and scourged him .
43019002	And ye soudiers wounde a croune of thornes and put it on his heed . And they dyd on him a purple garment
43019003	and sayd : hayll kynge of the Iewes : and they smote him on the face .
43019004	Pylate went forthe agayne and sayde vnto them : beholde I bringe him forth to you that ye maye knowe that I fynde no faute in him .
43019005	Then came Iesus forthe wearynge a croune of thorne and a robe of purple . And Pylate sayd vnto them : beholde ye man .
43019006	When the hye Prestes and ministres sawe him they cryed sayinge : crucify him crucify him . Pylate sayde vnto them . Take ye him and crucify him : for I fynde no cause in him .
43019007	The Iewes answered him . We have a lawe and by oure lawe he ought to dye : because he made him selfe the sonne of God .
43019008	When Pylate hearde that sayinge he was the moare afrayde
43019009	and went agayne into ye iudgment hall and sayde vnto Iesus : whence arte thou ? But Iesus gave him none answere .
43019010	Then sayde Pylate vnto him . Speakest thou not vnto me ? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify the and have power to lowse the ?
43019011	Iesus answered : Thou couldest have no power at all agaynst me except it were geven the from above . Therfore he yt delyvered me vnto the is moare in synne .
43019012	And from thence forthe sought Pylate meanes to lowse him : but the Iewes cryed sayinge : yf thou let him goo thou arte not Cesars frende . For whosoever maketh hi selfe a kynge is agaynst Cesar
43019013	When Pylate hearde yt sayinge he brought Iesus forthe and sate doune to geve sentece in a place called the pavement : but in the Hebrue tonge Gabbatha .
43019014	It was the Saboth even which falleth in the ester fest and aboute the sixte houre . And he sayde vnto the Iewes : beholde youre kynge .
43019015	They cryed awaye with him awaye with him crucify him . Pylate sayde vnto them . Shall I crucify youre kynge ? The hye Prestes answered : we have no kynge but Cesar .
43019016	Then delyvered he him vnto them to be crucified . And they toke Iesus and led him awaye .
43019017	And he bare his crosse and went forthe into a place called the place of deed mens sculles which is named in Hebrue Golgatha .
43019018	Where they crucified him and two other with him on ether syde one and Iesus in the myddes .
43019019	And Pylate wrote his tytle and put it on the crosse . The writynge was Iesus of Nazareth kynge of the Iewes .
43019020	This tytle reed many of the Iewes . For the place where Iesus was crucified was nye to the cite . And it was written in Hebrue Greke and Latyn .
43019021	Then sayde the hye prestes of ye Iewes to Pylate : wryte not kynge of the Iewes : but that he sayde I am kynge of the Iewes .
43019022	Pylate answered : what I have written that have I written .
43019023	Then the soudiers when they had crucified Iesus toke his garmentes and made foure partes to every soudier a parte and also his coote . The coote was with out seme wrought vpon thorowe out .
43019024	And they sayde one to another . Let vs not devyde it : but cast loostes who shall have it That the scripture myght be fulfilled which sayth . They parted my rayment amonge them and on my coote dyd cast lottes . And the soudiers dyd soche thinges in dede .
43019025	Ther stode by the crosse of Iesus his mother and his mothers sister Mary the wyfe of Cleophas and Mary Magdalene .
43019026	When Iesus sawe his mother and the disciple stondynge whom he loved he sayde vnto his mother : woman beholde thy sonne .
43019027	Then sayde he to ye disciple : beholde thy mother . And fro that houre the disciple toke her for his awne .
43019028	After that when Iesus perceaved that all thinges were performed : that the scripture myght be fulfilled he sayde : I thyrst .
43019029	Ther stode a vessell full of veneger by . And they filled a sponge with veneger and wounde it about with ysope and put it to his mouth .
43019030	Assone as Iesus had receaved of the veneger he sayd : It is fynesshed and bowed his heed and gaue vp the goost .
43019031	The Iewes then because it was the saboth eve that ye bodyes shuld not remayne apon ye crosse on ye saboth daye ( for that saboth daye was an hye daye ) besought Pylate that their legges myght be broken and that they myght be taken doune .
43019032	Then came the soudiers and brake the legges of the fyrst and of the other which was crucified with Iesus .
43019033	But when they came to Iesus and sawe that he was deed already they brake not his legges :
43019034	but one of the soudiers with a speare thrust him into the syde and forthwith came ther out bloud and water .
43019035	And he that sawe it bare recorde and his recorde is true . And he knoweth that he sayth true that ye myght beleve also .
43019036	These thinges were done that the scripture shuld be fulfilled : Ye shall not breake a boone of him .
43019037	And agayne another scripture sayth : They shall looke on him whom they pearsed .
43019038	After that Ioseph of Aramathia ( which was a disciple of Iesus : but secretly for feare of ye Iewes ) besought Pylate that he myght take doune the body of Iesus . And Pylate gave him licence .
43019039	And ther cam also Nicodemus which at the beginnynge came to Iesus by nyght and brought of myrre and aloes mingled to gether aboute an hundred pounde wayght
43019040	Then toke they the body of Iesu and wounde it in lynnen clothes with the odoures as ye maner of the Iewes is to bury .
43019041	And in the place where Iesus was crucified was a garden and in ye garden a newe sepulchre wherin was never man layd .
43019042	There layde they Iesus because of the Iewes saboth even for the sepulcre was nye at honde .
43020001	The morow after the saboth daye came Mary Magdalene erly when it was yet darcke vnto ye sepulcre and sawe the stone taken awaye from ye toumbe .
43020002	Then she ranne and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whome Iesus loved and sayde vnto them . They have taken awaye the Lorde out of the toumbe and we cannot tell where they have layde him .
43020003	Peter went forth and that other disciple and came vnto the sepulcre .
43020004	They ranne bothe to gether and that other disciple dyd out runne Peter and came fyrst to the sepulcre .
43020005	And he stouped doune and sawe the lynnen clothes lyinge yet wet he not in .
43020006	Then came Simon Peter folowynge him and went into ye sepulcre and sawe the lynnen clothes lye
43020007	and the napkyn that was aboute his heed not lyinge with the lynnen clothe but wrapped togeder in a place by it selfe .
43020008	Then went in also that other disciple which came fyrst to the sepulcre and he sawe and beleved .
43020009	For as yet they knew not the scriptures that he shuld ryse agayne from deeth .
43020010	And the disciples wet awaye agayne vnto their awne home .
43020011	Mary stode with out at the sepulcre wepynge . And as she wept she bowed her selfe into the sepulcre
43020012	and sawe two angels in whyte sittyng the one at the heed and the other at the fete where they had layde the body of Iesus .
43020013	And they sayde vnto her : woman why wepest thou ? She sayde vnto the : For they have taken awaye my lorde and I wote not where they have layde him .
43020014	When she had thus sayde she turned her selfe backe and sawe Iesus stondynge and knewe not that it was Iesus .
43020015	Iesus sayde vnto her : woman why wepest thou ? Whom sekest thou ? She supposynge that he had bene the gardener sayde vnto him . Syr yf thou have borne him hece tell me where thou hast layde him that I maye fet him .
43020016	Iesus sayde vnto her : Mary . She turned her selfe and sayde vnto him : Rabboni which is to saye master .
43020017	Iesus sayde vnto her touche me not for I am not yet ascended to my father . But goo to my brethren and saye vnto them I ascende vnto my father and youre father to : my god and youre god .
43020018	Mary Magdalene came and tolde the disciples yt she had sene the lorde and yt he had spoken soche thinges vnto her .
43020019	The same daye at nyght which was the morowe after ye saboth daye when the dores were shut where the disciples were assembled to geder for feare of the Iewes came Iesus and stode in the myddes and sayd to the : peace be with you .
43020020	And when he had so sayde he shewed vnto them his hondes and his syde . Then were the disciples glad when they sawe the Lorde .
43020021	Then sayde Iesus to them agayne : peace be with you . As my father sent me even so sende I you .
43020022	And when he had sayde that he brethed on them and sayde vnto the : Receave ye holy goost .
43020023	Whosoevers synnes ye remyt they are remitted vnto the . And whosoevers synnes ye retayne they are retayned .
43020024	But Thomas one of ye twelve called Didymus was not with the when Iesus came .
43020025	The other disciples sayd vnto him : we have sene ye lorde . And he sayde vnto the : except I se in his hondes the prent of the nayles and put my fynger in the holes of the nayles and thrust my honde into his syde I will not beleve .
43020026	And after . viii . dayes agayne his disciples were with in and Thomas with them . Then came Iesus when the dores were shut and stode in the myddes and sayde : peace be with you .
43020027	After that sayde he to Thomas : bringe thy fynger hether and se my hondes and bringe thy honde and thrust it into my syde and be not faythlesse but belevynge .
43020028	Thomas answered and sayde vnto him : my Lorde and my God .
43020029	Iesus sayde vnto him . Thomas because thou hast sene me therfore thou belevest : Happy are they that have not sene and yet beleve .
43020030	And many other signes dyd Iesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this boke .
43020031	These are written that ye myght beleve that Iesus is Christ the sonne of God and that in belevynge ye myght have lyfe thorowe his name .
43021001	After that Iesus shewed him selfe agayne at the see of Tyberias . And on this wyse shewed he him selfe .
43021002	There were to geder Simon Peter and Thomas which is called Didymus : and Nathanael of Cana a citie of Galile and the sonnes of Zebedei and two other of the disciples .
43021003	Simon Peter sayde vnto them : I goo a fysshynge . They sayde vnto him : we also will goo with the . They wet their waye and entred into a shippe strayght waye and that nyght caught they nothinge .
43021004	But when the mornynge was now come Iesus stode on the shore : neverthelesse the disciples knewe not yt it was Iesus .
43021005	Iesus sayde vnto the : syrs have ye eny meate ? They answered him no .
43021006	And he sayde vnto them : cast out ye net on the ryght syde of the ship and ye shall fynde . They cast out and anone they were not able to drawe it for ye multitude of fysshes
43021007	Then sayde the disciple whom Iesus loved vnto Peter : It is the Lorde . When Simon Peter hearde that it was ye lorde he gyrde his mantell to him ( for he was naked ) and sprange into the see
43021008	The other disciples came by ship : for they were not farre from londe but as it were two hondred cubites and they drewe the net with fysshes .
43021009	Assone as they were come to londe they sawe hoot coles and fysshe layd ther on and breed .
43021010	Iesus sayde vnto them : bringe of the fysshe which ye have now caught .
43021011	Simon Peter stepped forthe and drewe the net to londe full of greate fysshes an hondred and . liii . And for all ther were so many yet was not the net broken .
43021012	Iesus sayde vnto them : come and dyne . And none of the disciples durste axe him : what arte thou ? For they knewe that it was the lorde .
43021013	Iesus then came and toke breed and gave them and fysshe lykwyse
43021014	And this is now the thyrde tyme that Iesus appered to his disciples after that he was rysen agayne from deeth .
43021015	When they had dyned Iesus sayde to Simon Peter : Simon Ioana lovest thou me more then these ? He sayde vnto him : ye Lorde thou knowest that I love the . He sayde vnto him : fede my lambes .
43021016	He sayde to him agayne the seconde tyme : Simo Ioana lovest thou me ? He sayde vnto him : ye lorde thou knowest that I love ye . He sayde vnto him : fede my shepe .
43021017	He sayde vnto him ye thyrde tyme : Simon Ioanna lovest thou me ? And Peter sorowed because he sayde to him ye thyrde tyme lovest thou me and sayde vnto him : Lorde thou knowest all thinge thou knowest that I love the . Iesus sayde vnto him : fede my shepe .
43021018	Verely verely I saye vnto the when thou wast yonge thou gerdedst thy selfe and walkedst whyther thou woldest : but when thou arte olde thou shalt stretche forthe thy hondes and a nother shall gyrde ye and leade the whyther thou woldest not .
43021019	That spake he signifyinge by what deeth he shuld glorify God . And whe he had sayde thus he sayd to him folowe me .
43021020	Peter turned about and sawe that disciple who Iesus loved folowynge : which also lened on his brest at supper and sayde : Lorde which is he yt shall betraye the ?
43021021	When Peter sawe him he sayde to Iesus : Lorde what shall he here do ?
43021022	Iesus sayd vnto him Yf I will have him to tary tyll I come what is that to the ? folowe thou me .
43021023	Then went this sayinge a broode amonge the brethren that that disciple shulde not dye . Yet Iesus sayde not to him he shall not dye : but yf I will that he tary tyll I come what is that to the ?
43021024	The same disciple is he which testifieth of these thinges and wrote these thinges . And we knowe that his testimony is true .
43021025	There are also many other thinges which Iesus dyd : the which yf they shuld be written every won I suppose the worlde coulde not cotayne the bokes that shuld be written .
44001001	In the former treatise ( Deare frende Theophilus ) I have written of all that Iesus beganne to do and teache
44001002	vntyll the daye in the which he was taken vp after that he thorowe the holy goost had geven commaundementes vnto the Apostles which he had chosen :
44001003	to whom also he shewed him selfe alyve after his passion by many tokens apperynge vnto them fourty dayes and speakynge of the kyngdome of god
44001004	and gaddered them togeder and commaunded the that they shuld not departe from Ierusalem : but to wayte for ye promys of the father whereof ye have herde of me .
44001005	For Iohn baptised wt water : but ye shalbe baptised with the holy goost and that with in this feawe dayes .
44001006	When they were come togeder they axed of him sayinge : Lorde wilt thou at this tyme restore agayne ye kyngdome to Israel ?
44001007	And he sayde vnto them : It is not for you to knowe the tymes or the seasons which ye father hath put in his awne power :
44001008	but ye shall receave power of the holy goost which shall come on you . And ye shall be witnesses vnto me in Ierusalem and in all Iewrye and in Samary and even vnto the worldes ende .
44001009	And when he had spoken these thinges whyll they behelde he was take vp and a cloude receaved him vp out of their sight .
44001010	And while they looked stedfastly vp to heaven as he went beholde two men stode by them in white apparell
44001011	which also sayde : ye men of Galile why stonde ye gasinge vp into heave ? This same Iesus which is taken vp fro you in to heaven shall so come even as ye haue sene him goo into heaven .
44001012	Then returned they vnto Ierusalem from mount olivete which is nye to Ierusalem coteyninge a Saboth dayes iorney .
44001013	And when they were come in they went vp into a parler where abode both Peter and Iames Iohn and Andrew Philip and Thomas Bartlemew and Mathew Iames the sonne of Alpheus and Simo Zelotes and Iudas Iames sonne .
44001014	These all cotinued with one acorde in prayer and supplicacion with the wemen and Mary the mother of Iesu and with his brethren .
44001015	And in those dayes Peter stode vp in the myddes of the disciples and sayde ( the noumbre of names that were to gether were aboute an hondred and twenty )
44001016	Ye men and brethren this scripture must have nedes ben fulfilled which the holy goost thorow ye mouth of David spake before of Iudas which was gyde to them that tooke Iesus .
44001017	For he was noubred with vs and had obtayned fellouship in this ministracion .
44001018	And the same hath now possessed a plot of grounde with the rewarde of iniquite and when he was hanged brast a sondre in ye myddes and all his bowels gusshed oute .
44001019	And it is knowe vnto all the inhabiters of Ierusalem : in so moche that that felde is called in their mother tonge Acheldama that is to saye the bloud felde .
44001020	It is written in the boke of Psalmes : His habitacio be voyde and no man be dwellinge therin : and his bisshoprycke let another take .
44001021	Wherfore of these me which have copanyed with vs all ye tyme that the Lorde Iesus wet in and out amonge vs
44001022	begynninge at the baptyme of Iohn vnto that same daye that he was taken vp from vs must one be ordeyned to be are witnes with vs of his resurreccion .
44001023	And they appoynted two Ioseph called Barsabas ( whose syr name was Iustus ) and Mathias .
44001024	And they prayed sayinge : thou Lorde which knowest the hertes of all me shewe whether of these two thou hast chosen
44001025	that the one maye take the roume of this ministracion and apostleshippe from the which Iudas by transgression fell that he myght go to his awne place .
44001026	And they gave forthe their lottes and the lot fell on Mathias and he was counted with the eleven Apostles .
44002001	Whe the fyftith daye was come they were all with one accorde togeder in one place .
44002002	And sodenly ther cam a sounde from heaven as it had bene the comminge of a myghty wynde and it filled all the housse where they sate .
44002003	And ther appered vnto them cloven tonges lyke as they had bene fyre and it sate vpon eache of them :
44002004	and they were all filled with the holy goost and beganne to speake with other tonges even as the sprete gave them vtteraunce .
44002005	And ther were dwellinge at Ierusalem Iewes devoute men which were of all nacions vnder heaven .
44002006	When this was noysed aboute the multitude came to gether and were astonyed because that every man hearde the speake his awne touge .
44002007	They wondred all and marveyled sayinge amoge them selves : Beholde are not all these which speake of Galile ?
44002008	And how heare we every man his awne touge wherein we were boren ?
44002009	Parthians Medes and Elamytes and the inhabiters of Mesopotamia of Iury and of Capadocia of Ponthus and Asia
44002010	Phrigia Pamphilia and of Egypte and of the parties of Libia which is besyde Syrene and straungers of Rome Iewes and convertes
44002011	Grekes and Arabians : we have herde them speake with oure awne tonges the greate workes of God .
44002012	They were all amased and wondred sayinge one to another : what meaneth this ?
44002013	Other mocked the sayinge : they are full of newe wyne .
44002014	But Peter stepped forth with the eleve and lift vp his voyce and sayde vnto them : Ye men of Iewrye and all ye that inhabite Ierusalem : be this knowe vnto you and with youre eares heare my wordes .
44002015	These are not dronken as ye suppose : for it is yet but the thyrde houre of ye daye .
44002016	But this is that which was spoken by ye Prophete Iohel :
44002017	It shalbe in the last dayes sayth God : of my sprete I will powre out vpon all flesshe . And youre sonnes and youre doughters shall prophesy and youre yoge men shall se visions and youre olde me shall dreme dremes .
44002018	And on my servauts and on my honde maydens I will powre out of my sprete in those dayes and they shall prophesye .
44002019	And I will shewe wonders in heaven a bove and tokens in the erth benethe bloud and fyre and the vapour of smoke .
44002020	The sunne shalbe turned into darknes and the mone into bloud before that greate and notable daye of the Lorde come .
44002021	And it shalbe that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lorde shalbe saved .
44002022	Ye men of Israel heare these wordes . Iesus of Nazareth a ma approved of God amoge you with myracles wondres and signes which God dyd by him in ye myddes of you as ye youre selves knowe :
44002023	him have ye taken by the hondes of vnrightewes persones after he was delivered by the determinat counsell and foreknoweledge of God and have crucified and slayne :
44002024	whom God hath raysed vp and lowsed the sorowes of deeth because it was vnpossible that he shuld be holden of it .
44002025	For David speaketh of him : Afore honde I sawe God alwayes before me : For he is on my ryght honde that I shuld not be moved .
44002026	Therfore dyd my hert reioyce and my tonge was glad . Moreover also my flesshe shall rest in hope
44002027	because thou wilt not leve my soul in hell nether wilt suffre thyne holye to se corrupcio .
44002028	Thou hast shewed me the wayes of lyfe and shalt make me full of ioye with thy countenaunce .
44002029	Men and brethren let me frely speake vnto you of the partriarke David : For he is both deed and buryed and his sepulcre remayneth with vs vnto this daye .
44002030	Therfore seinge he was a Prophet and knewe that God had sworne with an othe to him that the frute of his loynes shuld sit on his seat ( in that Christ shulde ryse agayne in the flesshe )
44002031	he sawe before : and spake in the resurreccion of Christ that his soule shulde not be left in hell : nether his flesse shuld se corrupcio .
44002032	This Iesus hath God raysyd vp wherof we all are witnesses .
44002033	Sence now that he by the right honde of God exalted is and hath receaved of the father the promyse of the holy goost he hath sheed forthe that which ye nowe se and heare .
44002034	For David is not ascendyd into heave : but he sayde . The Lorde sayde to my Lorde sit on my right honde
44002035	vntill I make thy fooes thy fote stole .
44002036	So therfore let all the housse of Israel knowe for a suerty yt God hath made ye same Iesus whom ye have crucified lorde and Christ .
44002037	When they hearde this they were pricked in their hertes and sayd vnto Peter and vnto the other Apostles : Ye men and brethre what shall we do ?
44002038	Peter sayde vnto them : repent and be baptised every one of you in the name of Iesus Christ for the remission of synnes and ye shall receave the gyfte of the holy goost .
44002039	For ye promyse was made vnto you and to youre chyldre and to all that are afarre even as many as ye Lorde oure God shall call .
44002040	And with many other wordes bare he witnes and exhorted them sayinge : Save youre selves from this vntowarde generacion .
44002041	Then they that gladly receaved his preachynge were baptised : and the same daye ther were added vnto them aboute thre thousande soules .
44002042	And they continued in the Apostles doctrine and felloushippe and in breakinge of breed and in prayer .
44002043	And feare came over every soule . And many wondres and signes were shewed by the Apostles .
44002044	And all that beleved kept them selves to gedder and had all thinges comen
44002045	and solde their possessions and goodes and departed them to all men as every man had nede .
44002046	And they continued dayly with one acorde in the teple and brake breed in every housse and dyd eate their meate to gedder with gladnes and singlenes of hert
44002047	praysinge God and had faveour with all the people . And the Lorde added to ye congregacion dayly soche as shuld be saved .
44003001	Peter and Iohn went up togedder into the teple at the nynthe houre of prayer .
44003002	And ther was a certayne man halt from his mothers wobe who they brought and layde at the gate of the temple called beutifull to axe almes of them that entred into the temple .
44003003	Which same when he sawe Peter and Iohn that they wolde in to the teple desyred to receave an almes .
44003004	And Peter fastened his eyes on him with Iohn and sayde : looke on vs .
44003005	And he gaue hede vnto the trustinge to receave somthinge of them .
44003006	Then sayd Peter : Silver and golde have I none suche as I have geve I the . In the name of Iesu Christ of Nazareth ryse vp and walke .
44003007	And he toke him by the right honde and lifte him vp . And immediatly his fete and ancle bones receaved strenght .
44003008	And he sprage stode and also walked and entred with them into the temple walkinge and leapinge and laudynge God .
44003009	And all the people sawe him walke and laude God .
44003010	And they knewe him that it was he which sate and begged at the beutifull gate of the temple . And they wondred and were sore astonnyed at that which had happened vnto him .
44003011	And as ye halt which was healed helde Peter and Iohn all the people ranne amased vnto them in Salomons porche .
44003012	When Peter sawe that he answered vnto the people . Ye men of Israel why marvayle ye at this or why looke ye so stedfastly on vs as though by oure awne power or holynes we had made this man goo ?
44003013	The God of Abraham Isaac and Iacob the God of oure fathers hath glorified his sonne Iesus whom ye delyvered and denyed in the presence of Pylate whe he had iudged him to be lowsed .
44003014	But ye denyed the holy and iust and desyred a mortherar to be geven you
44003015	and kylled the Lorde of lyfe whom God hath raysed from deeth of the which we are wytnesses .
44003016	And his name thorow the fayth of his name hath made this man sound whom ye se and knowe . And the fayth which is by him hath geven to him this health in the presence of you all .
44003017	And now brethre I wote well that thorow ignorauce ye did it as dyd also youre heddes .
44003018	But those thinges which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his Prophetes how yt Christ shuld suffre he hath thus wyse fulfilled .
44003019	Repent ye therfore and turne yt youre synnes maye be done awaye when the tyme of refresshinge commeth which we shall have of the presence of the Lorde
44003020	and when God shall sende him which before was preached vnto you that is to wit Iesus Christ
44003021	which must receave heave vntyll the tyme yt all thinges which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophetes sence the worlde began be restored agayne .
44003022	For Moses sayd vnto the fathers : A Prophet shall the Lorde youre God rayse vp vnto you even of youre brethren lyke vnto me : him shall ye heare in all thinges whatsoever he shall saye vnto you .
44003023	For the tyme will come yt every soule which shall not heare that same Prophet shalbe destroyed from amonge the people .
44003024	Also all the Prophetes from Samuel and thence forth as many as have spoken have in lykwyse tolde of these dayes .
44003025	Ye are the chyldren of the Prophetes and of the covenaunt which God hath made vnto oure fathers sayinge to Abraham : Eve in thy seede shall all the kinredes of the erth be blessed .
44003026	Fyrst vnto you hath God raysed vp his sonne Iesus and him he hath sent to blysse you that every one of you shuld turne from youre wickednes .
44004001	As they spake vnto the people the prestes and the rular of the teple and the Saduces came vpon them
44004002	takynge it grevously that they taught ye pople and preached in Iesus the resurreccion fro deeth .
44004003	And they layde hondes on them and put them in holde vntill the nexte daye : for it was now even tyde .
44004004	How be it many of them which hearde the wordes beleved and the noumbre of the men was aboute fyve thousande .
44004005	And it chaunsed on the morowe that their rulars and elders and Scribes
44004006	as Annas the chefe Prest and Cayphas and Iohn and Alexander and as many as were of ye kynred of the hye prestes gadered to geder at Ierusalem
44004007	and set the other before them and axed : by what power or what name have ye done this syrs ?
44004008	Then Peter full of ye holy goost sayd vnto them : ye rulars of the people and elders of Israel
44004009	yf we this daye are examined of the good dede done to the sycke man by what meanes he is made whoale :
44004010	be yt knowen vnto you all and to the people of Israel that in the name of Iesus Christ of Nazareth whom ye crucified and whom God raysed agayne from deeth : even by him doth this man stonde here present before you whoale .
44004011	This is ye stone cast a syde of you bylders which is set in the chefe place of the corner .
44004012	Nether is ther salvacio in eny other . Nor yet also is ther eny other name geven to men wherin we must be saved .
44004013	When they sawe the boldnes of Peter and Iohn and vnderstode that they were vnlerned men and laye people they marveyled and they knew them that they were with Iesu :
44004014	and beholdinge also the ma which was healed stondinge with the they coulde not saye agaynst it .
44004015	But they comaunded them to go a syde out of the counsell and counceled amoge them selves
44004016	sayinge : what shall we do to these men ? For a manifest signe is done by the and is openly knowen to all them that dwell in Ierusalem and we canot denye it .
44004017	But that it be noysed no farther amoge the people let us threaten and charge them that they speake hence forth to no man in this name .
44004018	And they called them and comaunded them that in no wyse they shuld speake or teache in the name of Iesu .
44004019	But Peter and Iohn answered vnto them and sayde : whether it be right in the syght of God to obeye you moare then God iudge ye .
44004020	For we canot but speake that which we have sene and hearde .
44004021	So threatened they them and let them goo and founde no thinge how to punysshe them because of the people . For all me lauded God for the myracle which was done :
44004022	for the man was above fourty yeare olde on whom this myracle of healinge was shewed .
44004023	Assone as they were let goo they came to their felowes and shewed all that the hye prestes and elders had sayde to them .
44004024	And when they hearde that they lyfte vp their voyces to God with one accorde and sayde : Lorde thou arte God which hast made heaven and erth the see and all that in them is
44004025	which by the mouth of thy servaunt David hast sayd : Why dyd the hethen rage and the people immagen vayne thinges .
44004026	The kynges of the erth stode vp and the rulars came to gedder agaynst the Lorde and agaynst his Christ .
44004027	For of a trueth agaynst thy holy chylde Iesus whom thou hast annoynted bothe Herode and also Poncius Pylate with the Gentils and the people of Israel gaddered them selves to gedder
44004028	for to do whatsoever thy honde and thy counsell determined before to be done .
44004029	And now Lorde beholde their threatenynges and graunte vnto thy servauntes with all confidence to speake thy worde .
44004030	So that thou stretche forth thy honde that healynge and signes and wonders be done by the name of thy holy chylde Iesus .
44004031	And assone as they had prayed the place moved wheare they were assembled to gedder and they were all filled with the holy goost and they spake the worde of God boldely .
44004032	And the multitude of them that beleved were of one hert and of one soule . Also none of them sayde that eny of the thinges which he possessed was his awne : but had all thinges commen .
44004033	And with greate power gave the Apostles witnes of the resurreccion of the Lorde Iesu . And greate grace was with them all .
44004034	Nether was ther eny amonge them that lacked . For as many as were possessers of londes or housses solde them and brought the pryce of the thinges that were solde
44004035	and layed yt doune at the Apostles fete . And distribucion was made vnto every man accordinge as he had nede .
44004036	And Ioses which was also called of the Apostles Barnabas ( that is to saye the sonne of consolacion ) beynge a Levite and of the countre of Cipers
44004037	had londe and solde it . and layde the pryce doune at the Apostles fete .
44005001	A certayne man named Ananias with Saphira his wyfe solde a possession
44005002	and kepte awaye parte of the pryce ( his wyfe also beynge of counsell ) and brought a certayne parte and layde it doune at the Apostles fete .
44005003	Then sayde Peter : Ananias how is it that Satan hath filled thyne hert that thou shuldest lye vnto the holy goost and kepe awaye parte of the pryce of the lyvelod :
44005004	Pertayned it not vnto the only and after it was solde was not the pryce in thyne awne power ? How is it that thou hast coceaved this thinge in thyne herte ? Thou hast not lyed vnto men but vnto God .
44005005	When Ananias herde these wordes . he fell doune and gave vp the goost . And great feare came on all the that these thinges hearde .
44005006	And the yonge men roose vp and put him a parte and caryed him out and buryed him .
44005007	And it fortuned as it were aboute the space of . iii . houres after that his wyfe came in ignoraunt of that which was done .
44005008	And Peter sayde vnto her : Tell me gave ye the londe for so moche ? And she sayde : ye for so moche
44005009	Then Peter sayde vnto her : why have ye agreed to gether to tept the sprete of the Lorde ? Beholde the fete of them which have buryed thy husbande are at the dore and shall cary the out .
44005010	Then she fell doune strayght waye at his fete and yelded vp the goost . And the yonge men came in and founde her ded and caryed her out and buryed her by her husbande .
44005011	And great feare came on all the congregacion and on as many as hearde it .
44005012	By the hondes of the Apostles were many signes and wondres shewed amoge the people . And they were all together with one acorde in Salomons porche .
44005013	And of other durst no man ioyne him selfe to them : neverthelater the people magnyfied them .
44005014	The noumbre of them that beleved in the Lorde bothe of men and wemen grewe moare and moare :
44005015	in so moche that they brought the sicke into the strettes and layde them on beddes and palettes that at the lest waye the shadowe of Peter when he came by myght shadowe some of them .
44005016	There came also a multitude out of ye cities roud about vnto Ierusalem bringynge sicke folkes and them which were vexed with vnclene spretes . And they were healed every one .
44005017	Then ye chefe preste rose vp and all they that were with him ( which is the secte of the Saduces ) and were full of indignacion
44005018	and layde hondes on the Apostles and put them in the comen preson .
44005019	But the angell of the Lorde by nyght openned the preson dores and brought them forthe and sayde :
44005020	goo steppe forthe and speake in the temple to the people all the wordes of this lyfe .
44005021	When they hearde that they entred into the temple erly in the morninge and taught . The chefe prest came and they that were with him and called a counsell to gedder and all the elders of the chyldren of Israel and sent to the preson to fet them .
44005022	When the ministres came and founde them not in the preson they returned and tolde
44005023	sayinge : the preson founde we shut as sure as was possible and the kepers stondynge with out before ye dores . But whe we had opened we founde no man with in .
44005024	When the chefe prest of all and the ruler of the temple and the hye prestes hearde these thinges they douted of them whervnto this wolde growe .
44005025	Then came one and shewed them : beholde ye men yt ye put in preson stonde in the teple and teache the people . .
44005026	Then went the ruler of the teple with ministers and brought the with out violence . For they feared the people lest they shuld have bene stoned .
44005027	And when they had brought them they set them before the counsell . And ye chefe preste axed the
44005028	sayinge : dyd not we straytely comaunde you that ye shuld not teache in this name ? And beholde ye have filled Ierusalem with youre doctrine and ye intende to brynge this mans bloud vpon vs .
44005029	Peter and the other Apostles answered and sayde : We ought moare to obey God then men .
44005030	The God of oure fathers raysed vp Ie Iesus whom ye slewe and hanged on tre .
44005031	Him hath god lifte vp with his right hand to be a ruler and a savioure for to geve repetauce to Israell and forgevenes of synnes .
44005032	And we are his recordes concernynge these thinges and also the holy goost whom God hath geve to them yt obey him .
44005033	When they hearde yt they clave asunder : and sought meanes to slee them .
44005034	Then stode ther vp one in ye counsell a Pharisey named Gamaliel a doctoure of lawe had in auctorite amoge all the people and commaunded to put the Apostles a syde a lytell space
44005035	and sayde vnto them : Men of Israel take hede to youre selves what ye entende to do as touchinge these men
44005036	Before these dayes rose vp one Theudas bostinge him selfe to whom resorted a nombre of men about a foure hondred which was slayn and they all which beleved him were scatred a broode and brought to nought .
44005037	After this man arose ther vp one Iudas of Galile in the tyme when tribute began and drewe awaye moche people after him . He also perisshed : and all even as many as harkened to him are scattered a brood .
44005038	And now I saye vnto you : refrayne youre selves from these men let them alone . For yf ye cousell or this worke be of men it will come to nought .
44005039	But and yf it be of God ye can not destroye it lest haply ye be founde to stryve agaynst God .
44005040	And to him they agreed and called the Apostles and bet them and comaunded that they shuld not speake in ye name of Iesu and let them goo .
44005041	And they departed from the counsell reioysynge yt they were counted worthy to soffre rebuke for his name .
44005042	And dayly in the teple and in every housse they ceased not teachinge and preachinge Iesus Christ .
44006001	In those dayes as the nombre of the disciples grewe ther arose a grudge amonge the Grekes agaynst the Ebrues be cause their wyddowes were despysed in the dayly mynystracion .
44006002	Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to gether and sayde : it is not mete that we shuld leave the worde of God and serve at the tables .
44006003	Wherfore brethren loke ye out amoge you seven men of honest reporte and full of the holy goost and wysdome which we maye apoynte to this nedfull busynes .
44006004	But we will geve oure selves cotinually to prayer and to the ministracion of ye worde .
44006005	And the sayinge pleased the whoale multitude . And they chose Steven a man full of fayth and of the holy goost and Philip and Prochorus and Nichanor and Timon and Permenas and Nicholas a converte of Antioche .
44006006	Which they set before the Apostles and they prayed and layde their hondes on them .
44006007	And the worde of God encreased and the noubre of the disciples multiplied in Ierusalem greatly and a great company of the prestes were obedient to the faythe .
44006008	And Steven full of faythe and power dyd great wondres and myracles amoge ye people .
44006009	Then ther arose certayne of the synagoge which are called Lybertines and Syrenites and of Alexandria and of Cilicia and Asia and disputed with Steven .
44006010	And they coulde not resist the wysdome and the sprete with which he spake .
44006011	Then sent they in men which sayd : we have hearde him speake blasphemous wordes agaynst Moses and agaynst God .
44006012	And they moved ye people and the elders and the scribes : and came apon him and caught him and brought him to the counsell
44006013	and brought forth falce witnesses which sayde . This ma ceasith not to speake blasphemous wordes agaynst this holy place and the lawe :
44006014	for we hearde him saye : this Iesus of Nazareth shall destroye this place and shall chaunge the ordinaunces which Moses gave vs .
44006015	And all that sate in ye counsell loked stedfastly on him and sawe his face as it had bene the face of an angell .
44007001	Then sayde ye chefe prest : is it even so ?
44007002	And he sayde : ye men brethren and fathers harken to . The God of glory appered vnto oure father Abraha whyll he was yet in Mesopotamia before he dwelt in Charran
44007003	and sayd vnto him : come out of thy contre and from thy kynred and come into the londe which I shall shewe the .
44007004	Then came he out of the londe of Chaldey and dwelt in Charran . And after that assone as his father was deed he brought him into this lande in which ye now dwell
44007005	and he gave him none inheritaunce in it no not the bredeth of a fote : but promised yt he wolde geve it to him to possesse and to his seed after him when as yet he had no chylde .
44007006	God verely spake on this wyse that his seade shulde be a dweller in a straunge londe and that they shulde kepe them in bondage and entreate them evyll . iiii . C . yeares .
44007007	But the nacion to whom they shalbe in bondage will I iudge sayde God . And after that shall they come forthe and serve me in this place .
44007008	And he gave him the covenaunt of circumcision . And he begat Isaac and circumcised him the viii . daye and Isaac begat Iacob and Iacob the twelve patriarkes
44007009	And the patriarkes havinge indignacio solde Ioseph into Egipte . And God was with him
44007010	and delivered him out of all his adversities . And gave him faveour and wisdome in the sight of Pharao kynge of Egipte which made him governer over Egipte and over all his housholde .
44007011	Then came ther a derth over all the londe of Egipt and Canaan and great affliccion that our fathers founde no sustenauce .
44007012	But when Iacob hearde that ther was corne in Egipte he sent oure fathers fyrst
44007013	and at the seconde tyme Ioseph was knowen of his brethren and Iosephs kynred was made knowne vnto Pharao .
44007014	Then sent Ioseph and caused his father to be brought and all his kynne thre score and xv . soules .
44007015	And Iacob descended into Egipte and dyed bothe he and oure fathers
44007016	and were translated into Sichem ond were put in ye sepulcre that Abraham bought for money of the sonnes of Emor at Sichem .
44007017	When ye tyme of ye promes drue nye ( which God had sworme to Abraham ) the people grewe and multiplied in Egipte
44007018	till another kynge arose which knewe not of Ioseph .
44007019	The same dealte suttelly with oure kynred and evyll intreated oure fathers and made them to cast oute their younge chyldren that they shuld not remayne alyve .
44007020	The same tyme was Moses borne and was a proper childe in ye sight of God which was norisshed vp in his fathers housse thre monethes .
44007021	When he was cast out Pharoes doughter toke him vp and norisshed him vp for her awne sonne .
44007022	And Moses was learned in all maner wisdome of the Egipcians and was mighty in dedes and in wordes .
44007023	And when he was full forty yeare olde it came into his hert to visit his brethren the chyldren of Israhel .
44007024	And when he sawe one of them suffre wronge he defended him and avenged his quarell that had the harme done to him and smote the Egypcian .
44007025	For he supposed hys brethren wolde have vnderstonde how yt God by his hondes shuld save them But they vnderstode not .
44007026	And the next daye he shewed him selfe vnto the as they strove and wolde have set the at one agayne sayinge : Syrs ye are brethren why hurte ye one another ?
44007027	But he that dyd his neghbour wronge thrust him awaye sayinge : who made ye a rular and a iudge amonge vs ?
44007028	What wilt thou kyll me as thou dyddest the Egyptian yester daye ?
44007029	Then fleed Moses at that sayenge and was a stranger in the londe of Madian where he begat two sonnes .
44007030	And when . xl . yeares were expired ther appered to him in the wyldernes of mounte Syna an angell of the Lorde in a flamme of fyre in a busshe .
44007031	When Moses sawe it he wondred at the syght . And as he drue neare to beholde the voyce of the Lorde came vnto him :
44007032	I am ye God of thy fathers the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Iacob . Moses trembled and durst not beholde .
44007033	Then sayde ye Lorde to him : Put of thy showes from thy fete for the place where thou stondest is holy grounde .
44007034	I have perfectly sene the affliccion of my people which is in Egypte and I have hearde their gronynge and am come doune to delyver them . And now come and I will sende the into Egypte .
44007035	This Moses whom they forsoke sayinge : who made the a ruelar and a iudge : the same God sent bothe a ruler and delyverer by ye hondes of the angell which appered to him in the busshe .
44007036	And the same brought them out shewynge wonders and signes in Egypte and in the reed see and in the wyldernes . xl . yeares .
44007037	This is that Moses which sayde vnto the chyldre of Israel : A Prophet shall the Lorde youre God rayse vp vnto you of youre brethren lyke vnto me him shall ye heare .
44007038	This is he that was in ye congregacion in the wyldernes with the angell which spake to him in ye moute Syna and with oure fathers . This man receaved the worde of lyfe to geve vnto vs
44007039	to who oure fathers wolde not obeye but cast it from them and in their hertes turned backe agayne into Egypte
44007040	sayinge vnto Aaron : Make vs goddes to goo before vs . For this Moses that brought vs out of the londe of Egypte we wote not what is become of him .
44007041	And they made a calfe in those dayes and offered sacrifice vnto the ymage and reioysed in the workes of their awne hondes .
44007042	Then God turned him selfe and gave them vp that they shuld worship the starres of the skye as it is written in the boke of the prophetes . O ye of ye housse of Israel gave ye to me sacrefices and meate offerynges by the space of xl . yeares in the wildernes ?
44007043	And ye toke vnto you the tabernacle of Moloch and the starre of youre god Remphan figures which ye made to worshippe them . And I will translate you beyonde Babylon .
44007044	Oure fathers had the tabernacle of witnes in ye wyldernes as he had apoynted the speakynge vnto Moses that he shuld make it acordynge to the fassion that he had sene .
44007045	Which tabernacle oure fathers receaved and brought it in with Iosue into the possession of the gentyls which God drave out before the face of oure fathers vnto the tyme of David
44007046	which founde favour before God and desyred that he myght fynde a tabernacle for the God of Iacob .
44007047	But Salomon bylt him an housse .
44007048	How be it he that is hyest of all dwelleth not in teple made with hondes as saith the Prophete :
44007049	Heven is my seate and erth is my fote stole what housse will ye bylde for me sayth the Lorde ? or what place is it that I shuld rest in ?
44007050	hath not my honde made all these thinges ?
44007051	Ye stiffenecked and of vncircumcised hertes and eares : ye have all wayes resisted the holy goost : as youre fathers dyd so do ye .
44007052	Which of the prophetes have not youre fathers persecuted ? And they have slayne them which shewed before of the commynge of that iust whom ye have now betrayed and mordred .
44007053	And ye also have receaved a lawe by the ordinaunce of angels and have not kept it .
44007054	When they hearde these thinges their hertes clave a sunder and they gnasshed on him with their tethe .
44007055	But he beynge full of the holy goost loked vp stedfastlye with his eyes into heven and sawe the glorie of God and Iesus stondynge on the ryght honde of God
44007056	and sayde : beholde I se the hevens open and the sonne of man stondynge on the ryght honde of god .
44007057	Then they gave a shute with a loude voyce and stopped their eares and ranne apon him all at once
44007058	and caste him out of the cite and stoned him . And the witnesses layde doune their clothes at a yonge mannes fete named Saul .
44007059	And they stoned Steven callynge on and sayinge : Lorde Iesu receave my sprete .
44007060	And he kneled doune and cryed with a loude voyce : Lorde laye not this synne to their charge . And when he had thus spoken he fell a slepe .
44008001	Saul had pleasure in his deeth . And at yt tyme there was a great persecucion agaynst the congregacion which was at Ierusalem and they were all scattered abroade thorowout the regions of Iury and Samaria except the Apostles
44008002	Then devout men dressed Steven aud made great lamentacion over him .
44008003	But Saul made havocke of the congregacion entrynge into every housse and drewe out bothe man and woman and thrust the into preson .
44008004	They that were scattered abroade went every where preachyng the worde .
44008005	Then came Philip into a cite of Samaria and preached Christ vnto them .
44008006	And the people gave hede vnto those thinges which Philip spake with one acorde in that they hearde and sawe the miracles which he dyd .
44008007	For vnclene spretes cryinge with loude voyce came out of many that were possessed of them . And manye taken with palsies and many yt halted were healed
44008008	And ther was great ioye in that cite .
44008009	And ther was a certayne man called Simon which before tyme in the same cite vsed witche crafte and bewitched the people of Samarie sayinge that he was a man yt coulde do greate thinges
44008010	Whom they regarded from ye lest to the greatest sayinge : this felow is the great power of God .
44008011	And him they set moche by because of longe tyme with sorcery he had mocked the .
44008012	But assone as they beleved Philippes preachynge of the kyngdome of God and of the name of Iesu Christ they were baptised bothe men and wemen .
44008013	Then Simon him selfe beleved also and was baptised and cotinued with Phillip and wondered beholdynge the miracles and signes which were shewed .
44008014	When ye Apostles which were at Ierusalem hearde saye that Samaria had receaved ye worde of God : they sent vnto the Peter and Iohn
44008015	which when they were come prayed for the that they myght receave ye holy goost
44008016	For as yet he was come on none of them : But they were baptised only in the name of Christ Iesu .
44008017	Then layde they their hondes on them and they receaved the holy goost .
44008018	When Simo sawe that thorowe layinge on of the Apostles hondes on them the holy goost was geven : he offered the money
44008019	sayinge : Geve me also this power that on whom soever I put the hondes he maye receave the holy goost .
44008020	Then sayde Peter vnto him : thy monye perysh with the because thou wenest that the gifte of God maye be obteyned wt money .
44008021	Thou hast nether parte nor felloushippe in this busines . For thy hert is not ryght in the syght of God .
44008022	Repent therfore of this thy wickednes and praye God that ye thought of thyne hert maye be forgeven the .
44008023	For I perceave that thou arte full of bitter gall and wrapped in iniquite .
44008024	Then answered Simon and sayde : Praye ye to the lorde for me yt none of these thinges whiche ye have spoken fall on me .
44008025	And they whe they had testified and preached the worde of the lorde returned toward Ierusalem and preached the gospell in many cities of the Samaritas .
44008026	Then the angell of the lorde spake vnto Phillip sayinge : aryse and goo towardes mydde daye vnto ye waye yt goeth doune fro Ierusalem vnto Gaza which is in ye desert .
44008027	And he arose and wet on . And beholde a man of Ethiopia which was a chaberlayne and of grete auctorite wt Cadace quene of ye Ethiopias and had ye rule of all her treasure came to Ierusalem for to praye .
44008028	And as he returned home agayne sittynge in his charet he rede Esay ye prophet
44008029	Then ye sprete sayde vnto Phillip : Goo neare and ioyne thy selfe to yonder charet .
44008030	And Philip ranne to him and hearde him rede ye prophet Esayas and sayde : Vnderstondest thou what thou redest ?
44008031	And he sayd : how can I except I had a gyde ? And he desyred Philip that he wold come vp and sit wt him .
44008032	The tenoure of ye scripture which he redde was this . He was ledde as a shepe to be slayne : and lyke a lambe dome before his sherer so opened he not his mouth .
44008033	Because of his humblenes he was not estemed : who shall declare his generacio ? for his lyfe is taken fro the erthe .
44008034	The chamberlayne answered Philip and sayde : I praye the of whom speaketh the Prophet this ? of him selfe or of some other man ?
44008035	And Philip opened his mouth and beganne at ye same scripture and preached vnto him Iesus .
44008036	And as they went on their waye they came vnto a certayne water and the chamberlayne sayde : Se here is water what shall let me to be baptised ?
44008037	Philip sayde vnto him : Yf thou beleve with all thyne hert thou mayst . He answered and sayde : I beleve that Iesus Christe is the sonne of God .
44008038	And he comaunded the charet to stonde still . And they went doune bothe into the water : bothe Philip and also the chamberlayne and he baptised him .
44008039	And assone as they were come out of the water the sprete of the lorde caught awaye Philip yt the chamberlayne sawe him no moore . And he wet on his waye reioysinge :
44008040	but Philip was founde at Azotus . And he walked thorow out ye countre preachynge in their cities tyll he came to Cesarea .
44009001	And Saul yet brethynge oute threatnynges and slaughter agaynst ye disciples of the lorde went vnto ye hye preste
44009002	and desyred of him letters to Damasco to ye synagoges : that yf he founde eny of this waye whether they were men or wemen he myght bringe them bounde vnto Ierusalem .
44009003	But as he went on his iorney it fortuned yt he drue nye to Damasco and sodenly ther shyned rounde about him a lyght fro heven .
44009004	And he fell to ye erth and hearde a voyce sayinge to him : Saul Saul why persecutest thou me ?
44009005	And he sayde what arte thou lorde ? And the lorde sayd I am Iesus whom thou persecutest it shalbe harde for ye to kycke agaynst ye pricke .
44009006	And he bothe tremblynge and astonyed sayde : Lorde what wilt thou have me to do ? And ye Lorde sayde vnto him : aryse and goo into the cite and it shalbe tolde the what thou shalt do .
44009007	The men which iornayed with him stode amased for they herde a voyce but sawe no man .
44009008	And Saul arose from the erth and opened his eyes but sawe no man . Then ledde they him by the honde and brought him into Damasco .
44009009	And he was . iii . dayes with out syght and nether ate nor dranke .
44009010	And ther was a certayne disciple at Damasco named Ananias and to him sayde the lorde in a vision : Ananias . And the he sayde : beholde I am here lorde .
44009011	And the lorde sayde to him : aryse and goo into the strete which is called strayght and seke in the housse of Iudas after one called Saul of Tharsus . For beholde he prayeth
44009012	and hath sene in a vision a man named Ananias comynge in to him and puttynge his hondes on him that he myght receave his syght .
44009013	Then Ananias answered : Lorde I have hearde by many of this man how moche evell he hath done to thy sainctes at Ierusalem
44009014	and here he hath auctorite of the hye prestes to bynde all that call on thy name .
44009015	The lorde sayde vnto him : Goo thy wayes : for he is a chosen vessell vnto me to beare my name before the gentyls and kynges and the chyldren of Israel .
44009016	For I will shewe him how great thinges he must suffre for my names sake .
44009017	Ananias went his waye and entryd into ye housse and put his hondes on him and sayde : brother Saul the lorde that apperyd vnto the in the waye as thou camst hath sent me that thou myghtest receave thy syght and be filled with the holy goost .
44009018	And immediatly ther fell from his eyes as it had bene scales and he receaved syght and arose and was baptised
44009019	and receaved meate and was comforted . Then was Saul a certayne daye wt the disciples which were at Damasco .
44009020	And streyght waye he preached Christ in the synagoges how that he was the sonne of God .
44009021	All that hearde him were amased and sayde : is not this he that spoyled the which called on this name in Ierusalem and came hyther for ye entent that he shuld bringe the bounde vnto the hye prestes ?
44009022	But Saul encreased in stregth and confounded the Iewes which dwelte at Damasco affirminge that this was very Christ .
44009023	And after a good whyle ye Iewes toke counsell to gether to kyll him .
44009024	But their layinge awayte was knowen of Saul . And they watched at the gates daye and nyght to kyll him .
44009025	Then ye disciples toke him by night and put him thorow the wall and let him doune in a basket .
44009026	And when Saul was come to Ierusalem he assayde to cople him silfe with ye discyples and they were all afrayde of hym and beleued not that he was a disciple .
44009027	But Bernabas toke hym and brought hym to ye apostles and declared to the how he had sene ye Lorde in ye waye and had spoke wyth hym : and how he had done boldely at damasco in the name of Iesu .
44009028	And he had his conuersacion with them at Ierusalem
44009029	and quit hym silfe boldly in the name of the lorde Iesu . And he spake and disputed wyth the grekes : and they went aboute to slee hym .
44009030	But when the brethren knew of that they brought hym to cesarea and sent hym forth to Tharsus .
44009031	Then had ye congregacios rest thorowoute all Iewry and galile and Samary and were edified and walked in the feare of the lorde and multiplied by the comforte of the holy gost .
44009032	And it chaunsed yt as Peter walked throughoute all quarters he ca to ye saynctes which dwelt at Lydda
44009033	and there he foude a certayne ma namyd Eneas whych had kepte hys bed viii . yere sicke of the palsie .
44009034	Then sayde Peter vnto hym : Eneas Iesus Christ make ye whole . Aryse and make thy beed . And he arose immedyatly .
44009035	And all that dwelt at lydda and assaron sawe hym and tourned to the lorde .
44009036	Ther was at Ioppe a certayne woma ( whiche was a disciple named Tabitha which by interpretacion is called dorcas ) the same was full of good workes and almes dedes which she did .
44009037	And it chaunsed in those dayes that she was sicke and dyed . When they had wesshed her and layd her in a chamber :
44009038	Because Lydda was nye to Ioppa and the disciples had hearde that Peter was there they sent vnto hym desyrynge him that he wolde not be greved to come vnto them .
44009039	Peter arose and came with them and when he was come they brought him in to ye chamber . And all ye wydowes stode roude aboute hym wepynge and shewynge the cotes and garmentes which Dorcas made whill she was with the .
44009040	And Peter put the all forth and kneled doune and prayde and turned him to ye body and sayde : Tabitha aryse . And she opened her eyes and whe she sawe Peter she sat vp .
44009041	And he gave her ye honde and lyft her up and called the sainctes and wydowes and shewed her alyve .
44009042	And it was knowne throwout all Ioppa and many beleved on the Lorde .
44009043	And it fortuned that he taryed many dayes in Ioppa with one Simon a tanner .
44010001	Ther was a certayne man in Cesarea called Cornelius a captayne of ye soudiers of Italy
44010002	a devoute man and one yt feared God wt all his housholde which gave moche almes to the people and prayde God alwaye .
44010003	The same man sawe in a vision evydetly aboute ye nynthe houre of ye daye an angell of god comynge into him and sayinge vnto him : Cornelius .
44010004	When he looked on him he was afrayde and sayde : what is it lorde ? He sayde vnto him . Thy prayers and thy almeses ar come vp into remembraunce before God .
44010005	And now sende men to Ioppa and call for one Simon named also Peter .
44010006	He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner whose housse is by ye see syde . He shall tell the what thou oughtest to doo .
44010007	When the angell which spake vnto Cornelius was departed he called two of his housholde servauntes and a devoute soudier of them that wayted on him
44010008	and tolde them all the mater and sent them to Ioppa .
44010009	On the morowe as they wet on their iorney and drewe nye vnto the cite Peter went vp into the toppe of ye housse to praye aboute the . vi . houre .
44010010	Then wexed he an hongred and wolde have eate . But whyll they made redy . He fell into a trauce
44010011	and sawe heven opened and a certayne vessell come doune vnto him as it had bene a greate shete knyt at the . iiii . corners and was let doune to the erth
44010012	where in wer all maner of . iiii . foted beastes of the erth and vermen and wormes and foules of the ayer .
44010013	And ther came a voyce to him : ryse Peter kyll and eate .
44010014	But Peter sayde : God forbyd Lorde for I have never eaten eny thinge that is comen or vnclene .
44010015	And the voyce spake vnto him agayne the seconde tyme : what God hath clensed that make thou not comen .
44010016	This was done thryse and the vessell was receaved vp agayne into heven .
44010017	Whyle Peter mused in him selfe what this vision which he had sene meant beholde the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquirance for Simons housse and stode before the dore .
44010018	And called out won and axed whether Simon which was also called Peter were lodged there .
44010019	Whyll Peter thought on this vision the sprete sayde vnto him : Beholde men seke the :
44010020	aryse therfore get the doune and goo with them and doute not . For I have sent them .
44010021	Peter went doune to ye men which were sent vnto him from Cornelius and sayde Beholde I am he whom ye seke what is the cause wherfore ye are come ?
44010022	And they sayde vnto him : Cornelius the captayne a iust man and won that feareth God and of good reporte amonge all the people of the Iewes was warned by an holy angell to sende for the into his housse and to heare wordes of the .
44010023	Then called he them in and lodged them . And on ye morowe Peter wet awaye with them and certayne brethren from Ioppa accompanyed hym .
44010024	And the thyrd daye entred they into Cesaria . And Cornelius wayted for them and had called to gether his kynsmen and speciall frendes .
44010025	And as it chaunsed Peter to come in Cornelius met hym and fell doune at his fete and worshipped hym .
44010026	But Peter toke him vp sayinge : stonde vp : for evyn I my silfe am a ma .
44010027	And as he talked with him he cam in and founde many that were come to gether .
44010028	And he sayde vnto them : Ye do knowe how that yt ys an vnlawfull thynge for a man that is a Iewe to company or come vnto an alient : But god hath shewed me that I shuld not call eny man commen or vnclene :
44010029	therfore came I vnto you with oute sayege naye assone as I was sent for . I axe therfore for what intent have ye sent for me ?
44010030	And Cornelius sayde : This daye now . iiii . dayes I fasted and at the nynthe houre I prayde in my housse : and beholde a man stode before me in bright clothynge
44010031	and sayde : Cornelius thy prayer is hearde and thyne almes dedes are had in remembraunce in the sight of God .
44010032	Sende therfore to Ioppa and call for Simon which is also called Peter . He is lodged in the housse of one Simon a tanner by the see syde ye wich assone as he is come shall speake vnto ye .
44010033	Then sent I for ye immediatly and thou hast well done for to come . Now are we all here present before god to heare all thynges yt are commaunded vnto the of God .
44010034	Then Peter opened his mouth and sayde : Of a trueth I perseave that God is not parciall
44010035	but in all people he that feareth him and worketh rightewesnes is accepted with him .
44010036	Ye knowe the preachynge that God sent vnto the chyldren of Israel preachinge peace by Iesus Christe ( which is Lorde over all thinges ) :
44010037	Which preachinge was published thorow oute all Iewrye and begane in Galile after the baptyme which Iohn preached
44010038	how God had annoynted Iesus of Nazareth with the holy goost and with power which Iesus went aboute doinge good and healynge all yt were oppressed of the develles for God was with him .
44010039	And we are witnesses of all thinges which he dyd in the londe of the Iewes and at Ierusalem whom they slew and honge on tree .
44010040	Him God reysed vp ye thyrde daye and shewed him openly
44010041	not to all the people but vnto vs witnesses chosyn before of God which ate and dronke with him after he arose from deeth .
44010042	And he comaunded vs to preache vnto the people and testifie that it is he that is ordened of God a iudge of quycke and deed .
44010043	To him geve all the Prophetes witnes that thorowe his name shall receave remission of synnes all that beleve in him .
44010044	Whyle Peter yet spake these wordes the holy gost fell on all them which hearde the preachinge .
44010045	And they of ye circucision which beleved were astonyed as many as came wt Peter because that on the Gentyls also was sheed oute ye gyfte of the holy gost .
44010046	For they hearde them speake with tonges and magnify God . Then answered Peter :
44010047	can eny man forbyd water that these shuld not be baptised which have receaved the holy goost as well as we ?
44010048	And he comaunded them to be baptysed in the name of the Lorde . Then prayde they him to tary a feawe dayes .
44011001	And the Apostles and the brethren that were thorowout Iewry harde saye that the hethen had also receaved the worde of God .
44011002	And when Peter was come vp to Ierusalem they of the circumcision reasoned wyth him
44011003	sayinge : Thou wentest in to men vncircumcised and atest with them .
44011004	Then Peter began and expounded ye thinge in order to the sayinge :
44011005	I was in the cyte of Ioppa prayinge and in a traunce I sawe a vision a certen vessell descende as it had bene a large lynnyn clothe let doune from hevin by the fower corners and it cam to me .
44011006	Into the which when I had fastened myn eyes I consydered and sawe fowerfoted beastes of ye erth and vermen and wormes and foules of the ayer .
44011007	And I herde a voyce sayinge vnto me : aryse Peter sley and eate .
44011008	And I sayd : God forbyd lorde for nothinge comen or vnclene hath at eny tyme entred into my mouth .
44011009	But the voyce answered me agayne from heven cout not thou those thinges come which god hath clensed .
44011010	And this was done thre tymes . And all were takin vp agayne into heven .
44011011	And beholde immediatly ther were thre men come vnto the housse where I was sent from Cesarea vnto me .
44011012	And the sprete sayde vnto me that I shuld go with them with out doutinge . Morover the sixe brethren accompanyed me : and we entred into the mas housse .
44011013	And he shewed vs how he had sene an angell in his housse which stod and sayde to him : Send men to Ioppa and call for Symon named also Peter :
44011014	he shall tell the wordes wherby both thou and all thyne housse shalbe saved .
44011015	And as I begane to preach ye holy goost fell on them as he dyd on vs at the begynninge .
44011016	Then came to my remembrauce ye wordes of the Lorde how he sayde : Iohn baptised with water but ye shalbe baptysed with the holy goost .
44011017	For as moche then as God gave the lyke gyftes as he dyd vnto vs when we beleved on the Lorde Iesus Christ : what was I that I shuld have with stonde God ?
44011018	when they hearde this they helde their peace and gloryfied God sayinge : then hath God also to the gentyls graunted repentaunce vnto lyfe .
44011019	They which were scattryd abroade thorow the affliccion that arose aboute Steven walked thorow oute tyll they came vnto Phenices and Cypers and Antioche preachynge ye worde to no man but vnto the Iewes only .
44011020	Some of them were men of Cypers and Syrene which when they were come into Antioche spake vnto the Grekes and preched the Lorde Iesus .
44011021	And the honde of the Lorde was with them and a greate nombre beleved and turned vnto the Lorde .
44011022	Tydinges of these thinges came vnto ye eares of the congregacion which was in Ierusalem . And they sente forth Barnabas that he shuld go vnto Antioche .
44011023	Which when he was come and had sene the grace of God was glad and exhorted them all that with purpose of hert they wolde continually cleave vnto ye Lorde .
44011024	For he was a good man and full of the holy goost and of faythe : and moche people was added vnto the Lorde .
44011025	Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus for to seke Saul .
44011026	And when he had founde him he brought him vnto Antioche . And it chaunsed yt a whole yere they had their conversacion with the congregacio there and taught moche people : in so moche that the disciples of Antioche were the fyrst that were called Christen .
44011027	In those dayes came Prophetes fro Ierusalem vnto Antioche .
44011028	And ther stode vp one of them named Agabus and signified by the sprete that ther shuld be great derth throughoute all the worlde which came to passe in ye Emproure Claudius dayes .
44011029	Then the disciples every man accordinge to his abilite purposed to sende socoure vnto the brethren which dwelt in Iewry .
44011030	Which thinge they also dyd and sent it to the elders by the hondes of Barnabas and Saul .
44012001	In that tyme Herode the kynge stretched forthe his handes to vexe certayne of the congregacion .
44012002	And he kylled Iames the brother of Iohn with the swerde :
44012003	and because he sawe that it pleased ye Iewes he proceded forther and toke Peter also . Then were the dayes of swete breed .
44012004	And when he had caught him he put him in preson and delyvered him to . iiii . quaternios of soudiers to be kepte entendynge after ester to brynge him forth to the people .
44012005	Then was Peter kepte in preson . But prayer was made with out ceasynge of the congregacion vnto God for him .
44012006	And when Herode wolde have brought him oute vnto the people the same nyght slepte Peter bitwene two soudiers bounde with two chaynes and the kepers before the dore kepte the preson .
44012007	And beholde the angell of ye Lorde was there present and a lyght shyned in the lodge . And smote Peter on the syde and steryd him vp sayinge : aryse vp quyckly . And his cheynes fell of fro his hondes .
44012008	And the angell sayd vnto him : gyrde thy selfe and bynde on thy sandales . And so he dyd . And he sayde vnto him : cast thy mantle aboute the and folowe me .
44012009	And he came oute and folowed him and wist not that it was truthe which was done by the angell but thought he had sene a vision .
44012010	When they were past ye fyrst and ye seconde watche they came vnto yt yron gate yt ledeth vnto the cyte which opened to them by his awne accorde . And they went out and passed thorowe one strete and by and by the angell departed fro him .
44012011	And when Peter was come to him selfe he sayde : now I knowe of a surety that the Lorde hath sent his angell and hath delyvered me out of the honde of Herode and from all the waytynge for of the people of ye Iewes .
44012012	And as he consydred the thinge he cam to ye housse of Mary the mother of one Iohn which was called Marke also where many were gaddered to gedder in prayer .
44012013	As Peter knocked at the entry dore a damsell cam forth to herken named Rhoda .
44012014	And when she knew Peters voyce she opened not the entrey for gladnes but ran in and told how Peter stode before the entrey .
44012015	And they sayde vnto her : thou arte mad . And she bare them doune yt it was even so . Then sayde they : it is his angell .
44012016	Peter cotynued knockinge . When they had opened the dore and sawe him they were astonyed .
44012017	And he beckened vnto them with ye honde to holde their peace and tolde them by what meanes ye Lorde had brought him oute of the preson . And sayde : goo shew these thinges vnto Iames and to the brethren . And he departed and went into a nother place .
44012018	Assone as it was daye ther was no lyttell a doo amoge the soudyers what was becum of Peter .
44012019	When Herode had called for him and founde him not he examined the kepers and comaunded to departe . And he descended from Iewry to Cesarea and ther abode .
44012020	Herode was displeased with them of Tyre and Sydon . And they came all at once and made intercession vnto Blastus the kynges chamberlen and desyred peace because their countrey was norysshed by the kynges londe .
44012021	And upon a daye appoynted Herode arayed him in royall apparell and set him in his seate and made an oraycon vnto them .
44012022	And the people gave a shoute sayinge : it is ye voyce of a God and not of a man .
44012023	And immediatly the angell of ye Lorde smote him because he gave not God the honoure and he was eatyn of wormes and gave vp the goost .
44012024	And ye worde of God grewe and multiplied .
44012025	And Barnabas and Paul returned to Ierusalem when they had fulfilled their office and toke with them Iohn which was also called Marcus .
44013001	There were at Antioche in the congregacion certayne Prophetes and teachers : as Barnabas and Simon called Niger and Lucius of Cerene and Manahen Herode the Tetrarkes norsfelowe and Saul .
44013002	As they mynistred to the Lorde and fasted the holy goost sayde : separate me Barnabas and Saul for ye worke where vnto I have called them .
44013003	Then fasted they and prayed and put their hondes on them and let them goo .
44013004	And they after they were sent of the holy goost came vnto Seleutia and from thence they sayled to Cyprus .
44013005	And when they were come to Salamine they shewed ye worde of God in ye synagoges of ye Iewes . And they had Iohn to their minister .
44013006	When they had gone thorowout ye yle vnto ye cite of Paphos they foude a certayne sorserer a falce prophet which was a Iewe named Bariesu
44013007	which was with ye ruler of the countre won Sergius Paulus a prudet man . The same ruler called vnto him Barnabas and Saul and desyred to heare the worde of God .
44013008	But Elemas the sorcerar ( for so was his name by interpretacion ) wt stode them and sought to turne awaye the ruler fro the fayth .
44013009	Then Saul which also is called Paul beinge full of the holy goost set his eyes on him
44013010	and sayde : O full of all sutteltie and disseytfulnes the chylde of the devyll and ye enemye of all righteousnes thou ceasest not to pervert the strayght wayes of the Lorde .
44013011	And now beholde the honde of the Lorde is vpon the and thou shalt be blinde and not se the sunne for a season . And immediatly ther fell on him a myste and a darcknes and he went aboute sekinge them that shuld leade him by the honde .
44013012	Then the rular when he sawe what had happened beleved and wodred at the doctryne of the Lorde .
44013013	When they that were with Paule were departed by shyppe fro Paphus they cam to Perga a cite of Pamphilia : and there Iohn departed from them and returned to Ierusalem .
44013014	But they wandred thorowe the countres fro Perga to Antioche a cite of the coutre of Pisidia and wet in to the synagoge on the saboth daye and sate doune .
44013015	And after the lawe and ye Prophetes were redde ye rulers of the synagoge sent vnto them sayinge : Ye men and brethren yf ye have eny sermo to exhorte ye people saye on .
44013016	Then Paul stode vp and beckened with the honde and sayde : Men of Israel and ye that feare God geve audiece .
44013017	The God of this people chose oure fathers and exalted the people whe they dwelt as straugers in ye londe of Egypt and with a mighty arme brought them oute of it
44013018	and aboute the tyme of . xl . yeares suffred he their maners in the wyldernes .
44013019	And he destroyed . vii nacios in the londe of Canaan and devided their londe to them by lot .
44013020	And after warde he gave vnto them iudges aboute the space of . iiii . C . and . l . yeres vnto the tyme of Samuel ye Prophet .
44013021	And after that they desyred a kinge and God gave vnto them Saul the sonne of Cis a man of the tribe of Beniamin by the space of . xl . yeres .
44013022	And after he had put him doune he set vp David to be their kynge of whome he reported sayinge : I have founde David the sonne of Iesse a man after myne awne hert he shall fulfill all my will .
44013023	Of this manes seed hath God ( accordinge to his promes ) brought forth to the people of Israel a saviour one Iesus
44013024	when Iohn had fyrst preached before his cominge the baptyme of repentauce to Israel .
44013025	And when Iohn had fulfylled his course he sayde : whome ye thinke that I am the same am I not . But beholde ther cometh one after me whose shewes of his fete I am not worthy to lowse .
44013026	Ye men and brethren chyldren of the generacion of Abraham and whosoever amoge you feareth God to you is this worde of salvacio sent .
44013027	The inhabiters of Ierusalem and their rulers because they knewe him not nor yet the voyces of the Prophetes which are redde every Saboth daye they have fulfilled them in condepninge him .
44013028	And when they founde no cause of deeth in him yet desyred they Pylate to kyll him .
44013029	And when they had fulfilled all that were written of him they toke him doune from the tree and put him in a sepulcre .
44013030	But God raysed him agayne from deeth
44013031	and he was sene many dayes of them which came wt him fro Galile to Ierusalem . Which are his witnesses vnto the people .
44013032	And we declare vnto you how that ye promes made vnto the fathers
44013033	God hath fulfilled vnto vs their chyldre in that he reysed vp Iesus agayne eve as it is written in the fyrste psalme : Thou arte my sonne this same daye begat I the .
44013034	As concernynge that he reysed him vp from deeth now no more to returne to corrupcion he sayde on this wyse : The holy promyses made to David I will geve them faithfully to you .
44013035	Wherfore he saith also in another place : Thou shalt not soffre thyne holye to se corrupcion .
44013036	Howbe it David after he had in his tyme fulfilled the will of God he slepte and was layde with his fathers and sawe corrupcion .
44013037	But he whom God reysed agayne sawe no corrupcion .
44013038	Be it knowne vnto you therfore ye men and brethre that thorow this man is preached vnto you the forgevenes of synnes
44013039	and yt by him are all yt beleve iustified fro all thinges fro the which ye coulde not be iustified by ye lawe of Moses .
44013040	Beware therfore lest that fall on you which is spoken of in the Prophetes :
44013041	Beholde ye despisers and wonder and perishe ye : for I do aworke in youre dayes which ye shall not beleve yf a ma wolde declare it you .
44013042	When they were come out of the Synagoge of the Iewes the getyls besought yt they wolde preache the worde to them bitwene the Saboth dayes .
44013043	When the congregacion was broken vp many of the Iewes and verteous covertes folowed Paul and Barnabas which spake to them and exhorted them to cotinue in the grace of God .
44013044	And ye nexte Saboth daye came almoste the whole cite to gether to heare the worde of God .
44013045	When ye Iewes sawe the people they were full of indignacion and spake agaynst those thinges which were spoken of Paul spekinge agaynst it and raylinge on it .
44013046	Then Paul and Barnabas wexed bolde and sayde : it was mete that the worde of God shulde fyrst have bene preached to you . But seinge ye put it from you and thinke youre selfes onworthy of everlastinge lyfe : lo we turne to the gentyls .
44013047	For so hath the Lorde comaunded vs : I have made ye a light to the getyls yt thou be salvacio vnto ye ende of ye worlde .
44013048	The getyls hearde and were glad and glorified the worde of ye Lorde and beleved : eve as many as were ordeyned vnto eternall lyfe .
44013049	And ye worde of the Lorde was publisshed thorowe oute all the region .
44013050	But the Iewes moved ye worshypfull and honorable wemen and the chefe men of the cyte and reysed persecucio agaynst Paul and Barnabas and expelled them oute of their costes .
44013051	And they shouke of ye duste of their fete agaynst them and came vnto Iconiu .
44013052	And the disciples were filled with ioye and with the holy goost .
44014001	And it fortuned in Iconium that they went both to gether into the synagoge of ye Iewes and so spake that a gret multitude both of ye Iewes and also of the Grekes beleved .
44014002	But the unbelevinge Iewes steryd vp and vnquyeted the myndes of the Gentyls agaynste the brethre .
44014003	Longe tyme a bode they there and quyt them selves boldly with the helpe of the Lorde the which gave testimony vnto ye worde of his grace and caused signes and wondres to be done by their hondes .
44014004	The people of the cyte were devided : and parte helde with the Iewes and parte with the Apostles .
44014005	When ther was a saute made both of the gentyls and also of the Iewes with their rulers to put them to shame and to stone
44014006	the they were ware of it and fled vnto Listra and Derba cities of Licaonia and vnto the region that lyeth round aboute
44014007	and there preached the gospell .
44014008	And ther sate a certayne man at Listra weake in his fete beinge creple from his mothers wombe and never walkyd .
44014009	The same hearde Paul preache . Which behelde him and perceaved that he had fayth to be whole
44014010	and sayd with a loude voyce : stond vp right on thy fete . And he stert vp and walked .
44014011	And when the people sawe what Paul had done they lifte vp their voyces sayinge in the speache of Lycaonia : Goddes are come doune to vs in the lyknes of men .
44014012	And they called Barnabas Iupiter and Paul Mercurius because he was the preacher .
44014013	Then Iupiters Preste which dwelt before their cite brought oxe and garlondes vnto the churche porche and wolde have done sacrifise with the people .
44014014	But when the Apostles Barnabas and Paul herde that they rent their clothes and ran in amonge the people cryinge
44014015	and sayinge : syrs why do ye this ? We are mortall men lyke vnto you and preache vnto you that ye shuld turne from these vanyties vnto ye lyvinge God which made heaven and erth and the see and all that in them is :
44014016	the which in tymes past suffred all nacions to walke in their awne wayes .
44014017	Neverthelesse he lefte not him selfe with outen witnes in that he shewed his benefites in gevinge vs rayne from heaven and frutefull ceasons fyllinge oure hertes with fode and gladnes .
44014018	And with these sayinges scase refrayned they the people that they had not done sacrifice vnto them .
44014019	Thither came certayne Iewes fro Antioche and Iconium and optayned the peoples consent and stoned Paul and drewe him oute of the cyte supposynge he had bene deed .
44014020	How be it as the disciples stode rounde about him he arose vp and cam into the cyte . And the nexte daye he departed with Barnabas to Derba .
44014021	After they had preached to that cite and had taught many they returned agayne to Lisira and to Iconium and Antioche
44014022	and strengthed the disciples soules exhortinge them to continue in the faith affyrminge yt we must thorowe moche tribulacion entre into the kyngdome of God .
44014023	And when they had ordened them elders by eleccion in every congregacio after they had yrayde and fasted they comended them to God on whom they beleved .
44014024	And they went thorow out Pisidia and came into Paphilia
44014025	and when they had preached the worde of God in Perga they descended in to Attalia
44014026	and thence departed by shippe to Antioche fro whence they were delivered vnto the grace of God to the worke which they had fulfilled .
44014027	When they were come and had gaddered the congregacion to gedder they rehersed all that God had done by them and how he had opened the dore of faith vnto the getyls .
44014028	And ther they abode longe tyme with the disciples .
44015001	Then cam certayne from Iewrie and taught the brethren : excepte ye be circumcysed after the maner of Moses ye cannot be saved .
44015002	And when ther was rysen dissencion and disputinge not a litle vnto Paul and Barnabas agaynst them . They determined that Paul and Barnabas and certayne other of them shuld ascende to Ierusalem vnto the Apostles and elders aboute this question .
44015003	And after they were brought on their waye by the congregacion they passed over Phenices and Samaria declarynge the conuersion of the getyls and they brought great ioye vnto all ye brethren .
44015004	And when they were come to Ierusalem they were receaved of the congregacion and of the Apostles and elders . And they declared what thinges God had done by them .
44015005	Then arose ther vp certayne that were of the secte of the Pharises and dyd beleve sayinge that it was nedfull to circucise them and to enioyne the to kepe ye lawe of Moses .
44015006	And ye Apostles and elders came to geder to reason of this matter .
44015007	And when ther was moche disputinge Peter rose vp and sayde vnto them : Ye men and brethren ye knowe how that a good whyle agoo God chose amoge vs that the getyls by my mouth shuld heare the worde of the gospell and beleve .
44015008	And God which knoweth the herte bare them witnes and gave vnto them the holy goost eve as he dyd vnto vs
44015009	and he put no difference bitwene them and vs but with fayth purified their hertes .
44015010	Now therfore why tempte ye God that ye wolde put a yoke on the disciples neckes which nether oure fathers nor we were able to beare .
44015011	But we beleve that thorowe the grace of the Lorde Iesu Christ we shalbe saved as they doo .
44015012	Then all the multitude was peased and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul which tolde what signes and wondres God had shewed amonge the gentyls by them .
44015013	And when they helde their peace Iames answered sayinge : Men and brethren herken vnto me .
44015014	Simeon tolde how God at the begynnynge dyd visit the gentyls and receaved of them people vnto his name .
44015015	And to this agreith ye wordes of ye Prophetes as it is written .
44015016	After this I will returne and wyll bylde agayne the tabernacle of David which is fallen doune and that which is fallen in dekey of it will I bilde agayne and I will set it vp
44015017	that the residue of men might seke after the Lorde and also the gentyls vpo whom my name is named saith ye Lorde which doth all these thinges :
44015018	knowne vnto God are all his workes from the begynninge of the worlde .
44015019	Wherfore my sentece is yt we trouble not them which fro amonge the gentyls are turned to God :
44015020	but yt we write vnto them yt they abstayne them selves fro filthynes of ymages fro fornicacio from straglyd and fro bloude .
44015021	For Moses of olde tyme hath in every cite that preache him and he is rede in the synagoges every saboth daye .
44015022	Then pleased it the Apostles and elders wt the whole congregacio to sende chosyn men of their owne copany to Antioche with Paul and Barnabas . They sent Iudas called also Barsabas and Silas which were chefe men amonge the brethre
44015023	and gave them lettres in their hondes after this maner . The Apostles elders and brethren send gretynges vnto the brethre which are of the gentyls in Antioche Siria and Celicia .
44015024	For as moche as we have hearde yt certayne which departed fro vs have troubled you with wordes and combred youre myndes sayinge : Ye must be circumcised and kepe the lawe to whom we gave no soche comaundemet .
44015025	It semed therfore to vs a good thinge when we were come to gedder with one accorde to sende chosyn men vnto you with oure beloved Barnabas and Paul
44015026	men that have ieoperded their lyves for the name of oure Lorde Iesus Christ .
44015027	We have sent therfore Iudas and Sylas which shall also tell you the same thinges by mouth .
44015028	For it semed good to the holy gost and to vs to put no grevous thinge to you more then these necessary thinges :
44015029	that is to saye that ye abstayne from thinges offered to ymages from bloud from strangled and fornicacion . From which yf ye kepe youre selves ye shall do well . So fare ye well .
44015030	When they were departed they came to Antioche and gaddred the multitude togeder and delyvered ye pistle .
44015031	When they had redde it they reioysed of that consolacion .
44015032	And Iudas and Sylas beinge prophetes exhorted the brethren with moche preachynge and strengthed them .
44015033	And after they had taryed there a space they were let goo in peace of the brethren vnto the Apostles .
44015034	Not with stondynge it pleasyd Sylas to abyde there still .
44015035	Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioche teachynge and preachynge the worde of the Lorde with other many .
44015036	But after a certayne space Paul sayde vnto Barnabas : Let vs goo agayne and visite oure brethren in every cite where we have shewed the worde of the Lorde and se how they do .
44015037	And Barnabas gave counsell to take wt them Iohn called also Marke .
44015038	But Paul thought it not mete to take him vnto their company whiche departed from them at Pamphylia and went not with them to the worke .
44015039	And the dissencion was so sharpe bitwene them that they departed a sunder one from the other : so that Barnabas toke Marke and sayled vnto Cypers .
44015040	And Paul chose Sylas and departed delyvered of ye brethren vnto the grace of god .
44015041	And he went thorowe all Cyria and Cilicia stablisshynge the congregacions .
44016001	Then came he to Derba and to Lystra . And beholde a certayne disciple was there named Timotheus a womans sonne which was a Iewas and beleved : but his father was a Greke .
44016002	Of whom reported well the brethren of Lystra and of Iconium .
44016003	The same Paul wolde yt he shuld goo forth with him and toke and circumcised him because of the Iewes which were in those quarters : for they knewe all that his father was a Greke .
44016004	As they went thorow ye cities they delyvered the the decrees for to kepe ordeyned of the Apostles and elders which were at Ierusalem .
44016005	And so were the congregacions stablisshed in the fayth and encreased in noumbre dayly .
44016006	When they had goone thorow out Phrigia and the region of Galacia and were forbydde of the holy gost to preach the worde in Asia
44016007	they came to Misia and sought to goo into Bethinia . But the sprete soffered the not .
44016008	Then they went over Misia and cam doune to Troada .
44016009	And a vision appered to Paul in ye nyght . There stode a man of Macedonia and prayed him sayinge : come into Macedonia and helpe vs .
44016010	After he had sene ye vision immediatly we prepared to goo into Macedonia certified yt the lorde had called vs for to preache the gospell vnto them .
44016011	Then lowsed we forth from Troada and with a strayght course came to Samothracia and the nexte daye to Neapolim
44016012	and from thence to Philippos which is the chefest citie in ye partes of Macedonia and a fre cite . We were in that cite abydynge a certayne dayes .
44016013	And on the saboth dayes we went out of the cite besydes a ryver where men were wont to praye and we sate doune and spake vnto the wemen which resorted thyther .
44016014	And a certayne woman named Lydia a seller of purple of the cite of Thiatira which worshipped God gave vs audience . Whose hert the Lorde opened that she attended vnto the thinges which Paul spake .
44016015	When she was baptised and her housholde she besought vs sayinge : Yf ye thinke that I beleve on the Lorde come into my housse and abyde there . And she constrayned vs .
44016016	And it fortuned as we went to prayer a certayn damsell possessed with a sprete that prophesied met vs which brought her master and mastres moche vauntage with prophesyinge .
44016017	The same folowed Paul and vs and cryed sayinge : these men are the servauntes of the most hye God which shewe vnto vs the waye of salvacion .
44016018	And this dyd she many dayes . But Paul not cotent turned about and sayd to the sprete : I commaunde the in the name of Iesu Christ that thou come out of her . And he came out the same houre .
44016019	And when her master and mastres sawe yt the hope of their gaynes was gone they caught Paul and Sylas and drue the into the market place vnto the rulars
44016020	and brought them to the officers sayinge : These men trouble oure cite which are Iewes
44016021	and preache ordinaunces which are not laufull for vs to receave nether to observe seinge we are Romayns .
44016022	And the people ranne on them and the officers rent their clothes and comaunded them to be beaten with roddes .
44016023	And when they had beaten them sore they cast them into preson comaundynge the iayler to kepe them surely .
44016024	Which iayler when he had receaved suche comaundment thrust them into the ynner preson and made their fete fast in the stockes .
44016025	At mydnyght Paul and Sylas prayed and lauded God . And the presoners hearde them .
44016026	And sodenly ther was a greate erth quake so that ye fonndacion of the preson was shaken and by and by all the dores opened and every mannes bondes were lowsed .
44016027	When the keper of ye preson waked out of his slepe and sawe the preson dores open he drue out his swearde and wolde have kylled him selfe supposynge the presoners had bene fledde .
44016028	But Paul cryed with a lowde voyce sayinge : Do thy selfe no harme for we are all heare .
44016029	Then he called for a lyght and sprange in and came tremblynge and fell doune before Paul and Sylas
44016030	and brought them out and sayde : Syrs what must I do to be saved ?
44016031	And they sayde : beleve on the Lorde Iesus and thou shalt be saved and thy housholde .
44016032	And they preached vnto him the worde of the Lorde and to all that were in his housse .
44016033	And he toke them the same houre of the nyght and wasshed their woundes and was baptised with all that belonged vnto him strayght waye .
44016034	Whe he had brought them into his housse he set meate before them and ioyed that he with all his housholde boleved on God .
44016035	And when it was daye the officers sent the ministres sayinge : Let those men goo .
44016036	The keper of ye preson tolde this sayinge to Paul the officiers have sent worde to lowse you . Now therfore get you hence and goo in peace .
44016037	Then sayde Paul vnto them : they have beaten vs openly vncomdempned for all yt we are Romayns and have cast vs into preson : and now wolde they sende vs awaye prevely ? Naye not so but let them come the selves and set vs out .
44016038	When the ministres tolde these wordes vnto the officers they feared when they hearde that they were Romayns
44016039	and came and besought them and brought them out and desyred them to departe out of the cite .
44016040	And they wet out of ye preson and entred into the housse of Lidia and whe they had sene the brethren they comforted them and departed .
44017001	As they made their iorney thorow Amphipolis and Appolonia they came to Thessalonica where was a synagoge of the Iewes .
44017002	And Paul as his maner was went in vnto them and thre saboth doyes declared oute of the scripture vnto them
44017003	openynge and allegynge that Christ must nedes have suffred and rysen agayne from deeth and that this Iesus was Christ whom ( sayde he ) I preache to you .
44017004	And some of them beleved and came and companyed with Paul and Sylas : also of the honourable Grekes a greate multitude and of the chefe wemen not a feawe .
44017005	But the Iewes which beleved not havynge indignacio toke vnto the evyll men which were vagabondes and gadered a company and set all the cite on a roore and made asaute vnto the housse of Iason and sought to bringe the out to the people .
44017006	But when they founde them not they drue Iason and certayne brethren vnto the heedes of the cite cryinge : these that trouble the worlde are come hydder also
44017007	which Iason hath receaved prevely . And these all do contrary to the elders of Cesar affirmynge another kynge one Iesus .
44017008	And they troubled the people and the officers of the cite when they hearde these thinges .
44017009	And when they were sufficiently answered of Iason and of the other they let the goo .
44017010	And the brethren immediatly sent awaye Paul and Sylas by nyght vnto Berrea . Which when they were come thyther they entred into ye synagoge of the Iewes .
44017011	These were the noblest of byrthe amonge the of Thessalonia which receaved the worde wt all diligence of mynde and searched ye scriptures dayly whether those thinges were even so .
44017012	And many of the beleved : also of worshipfull weme which were Grekes and of men not a feawe .
44017013	When the Iewes of Thessalonia had knowledge that ye worde of God was preached of Paul at Berrea they came there and moved the people .
44017014	And then by and by ye brethre sent awaye Paul to goo as it were to ye see : but Sylas and Timotheus abode there still .
44017015	And they that gyded Paul brought him vnto Attens and receaved a comaundment vnto Sylas and Timotheus for to come to him at once and came their waye .
44017016	Whyll Paul wayted for them at Attens his sprete was moved in him to se the cite geven to worshippinge of ymages .
44017017	Then he disputed in the synagoge wt the Iewes and with the devout persones and in the market dayly with the that came vnto him .
44017018	Certayne philosophers of ye Epicures and of ye stoyckes disputed with him . And some ther were which sayde : what will this babler saye . Other sayd : he semeth to be a tydynges bringer of newe devyls because he preached vnto them Iesus and the resurreccion .
44017019	And they toke him and brought him into Marsestrete sayinge : maye we not knowe what this newe doctrine wher of thou speakest is ?
44017020	For thou bringest straunge tydynges to oure eares . We wolde knowe therfore what these thinges meane .
44017021	For all the Attenians and straungers which were there gave the selves to nothinge els but ether to tell or to heare newe tydynges .
44017022	Paul stode in the myddes of Marse strete and sayde : ye men of Attens I perceave that in all thinges ye are to supersticious .
44017023	For as I passed by and behelde the maner how ye worship youre goddes I founde an aultre wher in was written : vnto ye vnknowen god . Whom ye then ignoratly worship him shewe I vnto you .
44017024	God that made the worlde and all that are in it seynge that he is Lorde of heven and erth he dwelleth not in temples made with hondes
44017025	nether is worshipped with mennes hondes as though he neded of eny thinge seinge he him selfe geveth lyfe and breeth to all men every where
44017026	and hath made of one bloud all nacions of men for to dwell on all the face of the erthe and hath assigned before how longe tyme and also the endes of their inhabitacion
44017027	that they shuld seke God yf they myght fele and fynde him though he be not farre from every one of vs .
44017028	For in him we lyve move and have oure beynge as certayne of youre awne Poetes sayde . For we are also his generacion .
44017029	For as moche then as we are the generacion of God we ought not to thynke that the godhed is lyke vnto golde silver or stone graven by crafte and ymaginacion of man .
44017030	And the tyme of this ignoraunce God regarded not : but now he byddeth all men every where repent
44017031	because he hath apoynted a daye in the which he will iudge the worlde acordynge to ryghtewesses by that man whom he hath apoynted and hath offered faith to all men after that he had raysed him from deeth .
44017032	When they hearde of ye resurreccion from deeth some mocked and other sayde : we will heare the agayne of this matter .
44017033	So Paul departed from amonge them .
44017034	Howbeit certayne men clave vnto Paul and beleved amonge the which was Dionysius a senatour and a woman named Damaris and other with them .
44018001	After that Paul departed from Attens and came to Corinthu
44018002	and founde a certayne Iewe named Aquila borne in Ponthus latly come from Italie wt his wyfe Priscilla ( because that the Emperour Claudius had comaunded all Iewes to departe fro Rome ) and he drewe vnto them .
44018003	And because he was of the same crafte he abode with them and wrought : their crafte was to make tentes .
44018004	And he preached in ye synagoge every saboth daye and exhorted the Iewes and the gentyls .
44018005	When Sylas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia Paul was constrayned by the sprete to testifie to the Iewes that Iesus was very Christ .
44018006	And whe they sayde cotrary and blasphemed he shoke his rayment and sayde vnto the : youre bloud apon youre awne heeddes and fro hence forth I goo blamelesse vnto ye gentyls .
44018007	And he departed thence and entred into a certayne manes housse named Iustus a worshiper of god whose housse ioyned harde to ye synagoge .
44018008	How be it one Crispus ye chefe rular of the synagoge beleved on ye lorde with all his housholde and many of the Corinthias gave audience and beleved and were baptised .
44018009	Then spake the lorde to Paul in the nyght by a vision : be not afrayde but speake and holde not thy peace :
44018010	for I am with the and no man shall invade the that shall hurte the . For I have moche people in this cite .
44018011	And he continued there a yeare and sixe monethes and taught them the worde of God .
44018012	When Gallio was rular of the countre of Acaia the Iewes made insurreccion with one accorde agaynst Paul and brought him to the iudgement seate
44018013	saying : this felow counceleth men to worship God contrary to ye lawe .
44018014	And as Paul was about to open his mouth Gallio sayde vnto ye Iewes : yf it were a matter of wronge or an evyll dede ( o ye Iewes ) reason wolde that I shuld heare you :
44018015	but yf it be a question of wordes or of names or of youre lawe loke ye to it youre selves . For I wilbe no iudge in soche maters
44018016	and he drave them from the seate .
44018017	Then toke all the Grekes Sostenes the chefe rular of the synagoge and smote him before the iudges seate . And Gallio cared for none of tho thinges .
44018018	Paul after this taryed there yet a good whyle and then toke his leave of the brethren and sayled thence into Ciria Priscilla and Aquila accompanyinge him . And he shore his heed in Cenchrea for he had a vowe .
44018019	And he came to Ephesus and lefte them there : but he him selfe entred into the synagoge and reasoned with the Iewes .
44018020	When they desyred him to tary longer tyme with the he consented not
44018021	but bad the fare well sayinge . I must nedes at this feast that cometh be in Ierusalem : but I will returne agayne vnto you yf God will . And he departed from Ephesus
44018022	and came vnto Cesarea : and ascended and saluted the congregacion and departed vnto Antioche
44018023	and when he had taryed there a whyle he departed . And went over all the countre of Galacia and Phrigia by order strengthynge all the disciples .
44018024	And a certayne Iewe named Apollos borne at Alexandria came to Ephesus an eloquent man and myghty in the scriptures .
44018025	The same was informed in the waye of the Lorde and he spake fervently in the sprete and taught diligently the thinges of the Lorde and knewe but the baptim of Iohn only .
44018026	And the same began to speake boldely in the synagoge . And when Aquila and Priscilla had hearde him : they toke him vnto them and expounded vnto him the waye of God more perfectly .
44018027	And when he was disposed to goo into Acaia the brethren wrote exhortynge the disciples to receave him . After he was come thyther he holpe them moche which had beleved thorowe grace .
44018028	And myghtely he overcame the Iewes and that openly shewynge by the scriptures that Iesus was Christ .
44019001	It fortuned whyll Appollo was at Corinthum that Paul passed thorow the vpper costes and came to Ephesus and foude certayne disciples
44019002	and sayd vnto them : have ye receaved the holy gost sence ye beleved ? And they sayde vnto him : no we have not hearde whether ther be eny holy goost or no .
44019003	And he sayd vnto them : wher wt were ye then baptised ? And they sayd : with Iohns baptim
44019004	Then sayde Paul : Iohn verely bapiised with the baptim of repentaunce sayinge vnto the people that they shuld beleve on him which shuld come after him : that is on Christ Iesus .
44019005	When they hearde that they were baptised in the name of the lorde Iesu .
44019006	And Paul layde his hondes apon them and the holy gost came on them and they spake with tonges and prophesied
44019007	and all the men were aboute . xii .
44019008	And he went into the synagoge and behaved him selfe boldely for the space of thre monethes disputynge and gevynge them exhortacions of the kyngdome of God .
44019009	When dyvers wexed harde herted and beleved not but spake evyll of the waye and that before the multitude : he departed from them and seperated the disciples . And disputed dayly in ye scole of one called Tyranus .
44019010	And this contynued by the space of two yeares : so yt all they which dwelt in Asia hearde the worde of the lorde Iesu bothe Iewes and Grekes .
44019011	And god wrought no small miracles by the hondes of Paul :
44019012	so that from his body were brought vnto the sicke napkyns or partlettes and the diseases departed from the and the evyll spretes went out of them .
44019013	Then certayne of the vagabounde Iewes exorcistes toke apon them to call over them which had evyll spretes the name of the lorde Iesus sayinge : We adiure you by Iesu who Paul preacheth .
44019014	And ther were seven sonnes of one Sceva a Iewe and chefe of the prestes which dyd so .
44019015	And the evyll sprete answered and sayde : Iesus I knowe and Paul I knowe : but who are ye ?
44019016	And ye man in who the evyll sprete was ranne on the and overcame the and prevayled agaynst them so that they fledde out of that housse naked and wouded .
44019017	And this was knowen to all ye Iewes and Grekes also which dwelt at Ephesus and feare came on them all and they magnified the name of ye lorde Iesus .
44019018	And many yt beleved came and confessed and shewed their workes .
44019019	Many of the which vsed curious craftes brought their bokes and burned the before all men and they counted the price of the and foude it fifty thousande silverlynges .
44019020	So myghtely grewe ye worde of god and prevayled .
44019021	After these thinges were ended Paul purposed in the sprete to passe over Macedonia and Achaia and to goo to Ierusalem saying : After I have bene there I must also se Rome .
44019022	So sent he into Macedonia two of the that ministred vnto him Timotheus and Erastus : but he him selfe remayned in Asia for a season .
44019023	The same tyme ther arose no lytell a do aboute that waye .
44019024	For a certayne man named Demetrius a silvermyth which made silver schrynes for Diana was not a lytell beneficiall vnto the craftes men .
44019025	Which he called to geder with the worke men of lyke occupacion and sayd : Syrs ye knowe that by this crafte we have vauntage .
44019026	Moreover ye se and heare that not alone at Ephesus but almost thorowe oute all Asia this Paul hath persuaded and turned awaye moche people saying yt they be not goddes which are made wt hondes .
44019027	So that not only this oure crafte cometh into parell to be set at nought : but also that ye temple of ye greate goddas Diana shuld be despysed and her magnificence shuld be destroyed which all Asia and the worlde worshippeth .
44019028	When they hearde these sayinges they were full of wrathe and cryed out saying : Greate is Diana of the Ephesians .
44019029	And all the cite was on a roore and they russhed in to the comen hall with one assent and caught Gayus and Aristarcus men of Macedonia Pauls companios .
44019030	When Paul wolde have entred in vnto the people ye disciples suffered him not .
44019031	Certayne also of ye chefe of Asia which were his frendes sent vnto him desyrynge him that he wolde not preace into the comen hall .
44019032	Some cryed one thinge and some another and the congregacion was all out of quiet and ye moare parte knewe not wherfore they were come togeder .
44019033	Some of the company drue forth Alexander the Iewes thrustynge him forwardes . Alexander beckened with the honde and wolde have geven ye people an answer .
44019034	When they knewe ye he was a Iewe ther arose a shoute almost for the space of two houres of all men cryinge greate is Diana of the Ephesians .
44019035	When the toune clarcke had ceased the people he sayd : ye men of Ephesus what man is it that knoweth not how that the cite of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddas Diana and of ye ymage which came fro heven .
44019036	Seinge then yt no man sayth here agaynst ye ought to be content and to do nothinge rasshly :
44019037	For ye have brought hyther these me whiche are nether robbers of churches nor yet despisers of youre goddes .
44019038	Wherfore yf Demetrius and the craftes men which are wt him have eny sayinge to eny man the lawe is open and ther are ruelars let the accuse one another .
44019039	Yf ye goo about eny other thinge it maye be determined in a lawfull cogregacion
44019040	For we are in ieoperdy to be accused of this dayes busines : for as moche as ther is no cause wherby we maye geve a rekenynge of this concourse of people .
44019041	And when he had thus spoken he let the congregacion departe .
44020001	After the rage was ceased Paul called the disciples vnto him and toke his leave of them and departed for to goo into Macedonia .
44020002	And when he had gone over those parties and geven them large exhortacions he came into Grece
44020003	and there abode . iii . monethes . And when the Iewes layde wayte for him as he was about to sayle into Syria he purposed to returne thorowe Macedonia .
44020004	Ther acompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berrea and of Thessalonia Aristarcus and Secundus and Gayus of Derba and Timotheus : and out of Asia Tychicus and Trophimos .
44020005	These went before and taryed vs at Troas .
44020006	And we sayled awaye fro Philippos after the ester holydayes and came vnto them to Troas in five dayes where we abode seven dayes .
44020007	And on the morowe after the saboth daye the disciples came to geder for to breake breed and Paul preached vnto them ( redy to departe on the morowe ) and cotinued the preachynge vnto mydnyght .
44020008	And there were many lyghtes in the chamber where thy were gaddered to geder
44020009	and there sate in a wyndowe a certayne yonge man named Eutichos fallen into a depe slepe . And as Paul declared he was the moare overcome with slepe and fell doune from the thyrde lofte and was taken vp deed .
44020010	Paul went doune and fell on him and embrased him and sayde : make nothinge ado for his lyfe is in him .
44020011	When he was come vp agayne he brake breed and tasted and comened a longe whyle even tyll the mornynge and so departed .
44020012	And they brought the youge man a lyve and were not alytell comforted .
44020013	And we went a fore to shippe and lowsed vnto Asson there to receave Paul . For so had he apoynted and wolde him selfe goo a fote .
44020014	When he was come to vs vnto Asson we toke him in and came to Mytelenes .
44020015	And we sayled thence and came the nexte daye over agaynst Chios . And the nexte daye we aryved at Samos and taryed at Trogilion . The nexte daye we came to Myleton :
44020016	for Paul had determined to leave Ephesus as they sayled because he wolde not spende ye tyme in Asia . For he hasted to be ( yf he coulde possible ) at Ierusalem at the daye of pentecoste .
44020017	Wherfore from Myleton he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the cogregacion .
44020018	And when they were come to him he sayde vnto the : Ye knowe fro the fyrst daye yt I came vnto Asia after what maner I have bene wt you at all ceasons
44020019	servynge the lorde with all humblenes of mynde and with many teares and temptacions which happened vnto me by the layinges awayte of the Ieues
44020020	and how I kept backe no thinge that was profitable : but that I have shewed you and taught you openly and at home in youre houses
44020021	witnessinge bothe to the Iewes and also to the Grekes the repentaunce toward God and faith towarde oure Lorde Iesu .
44020022	And now beholde I goo bounde in the sprete vnto Ierusalem and knowe not what shall come on me there
44020023	but that the holy goost witnesseth in every cite sayinge : yt bondes and trouble abyde me .
44020024	But none of tho thinges move me : nether is my lyfe dere vnto my selfe that I myght fulfill my course wt ioye and the ministracio which I have receaved of ye Lorde Iesu to testify the gospell of ye grace of god .
44020025	And now beholde I am sure yt hence forth ye all ( thorow who I have gone preachinge ye kyngdome of God ) shall se my face no moore .
44020026	Wherfore I take you to recorde this same daye that I am pure fro the bloude of all me .
44020027	For I have kepte nothinge backe : but have shewed you all the counsell of God .
44020028	Take hede therfore vnto youre selves and to all the flocke wherof the holy goost hath made you oversears to rule the congregacion of God which he hath purchased with his bloud .
44020029	For I am sure of this that after my departynge shall greveous wolves entre in amonge you which will not spare the flocke .
44020030	Moreover of youre awne selves shall men aryse speakinge perverse thinges to drawe disciples after the .
44020031	Therfore awake and remember that by the space of . iii . yeares I ceased not to warne every one of you both nyght and daye with teares .
44020032	And now brethren I comende you to God and to the worde of his grace which is able to bylde further and to geve you an inheritaunce amoge all them which are sanctified .
44020033	I have desyred no mas silver golde or vesture .
44020034	Ye knowe well yt these hondes have ministred vnto my necessities and to them that were wt me .
44020035	I have shewed you all thinges how that so laborynge ye ought to receave the weake and to remember the wordes of the Lorde Iesu howe that he sayde : It is more blessed to geve then to receave .
44020036	When he had thus spoken he kneled doune and prayed with them all .
44020037	And they wept all aboundantly and fell on Pauls necke and kissed him
44020038	sorowinge most of all for the wordes which he spake that they shuld se his face no moore . And they acompanyed him vnto the shyppe .
44021001	And it chaunsed that assone as we had launched forth and were departed from them we came with a strayght course vnto Choon and the daye folowinge vnto the Rhodes and from thence vnto Patara .
44021002	And we founde a shippe redy to sayle vnto Phenices and went a borde and set forthe .
44021003	Then appered vnto vs Cyprus and we lefte it on the lefte honde and sayled vnto Syria and came vnto Tyre . For there the shyppe vnladed her burthen .
44021004	And when we had founde brethren we taryed there . vii . dayes . And they tolde Paul thorowe ye sprete that he shuld not goo vp to Ierusalem .
44021005	And when the dayes were ended we departed and went oure wayes and they all brought vs on oure waye wt their wyves and chyldren tyll we were come out of the cyte . And we kneled doune in the shore and prayde .
44021006	And when we had taken oure leave one of another we toke shyppe and they returned home agayne .
44021007	When we had full ended the course fro Tyre we aryved at Ptolomaida and saluted the brethren and abode with the one daye .
44021008	The nexte daye we that were of Pauls copany departed and came vnto Cesarea . And we entred into the housse of Philip ye Evagelist which was one of the seve deacones and abode with him .
44021009	The same man had fower doughters virges which dyd prophesy .
44021010	And as we taried there a good many dayes there came a certayne prophete from Iurie named Agabus .
44021011	When he was come vnto vs he toke Pauls gerdell and bounde his hondes and fete and sayde : thus saith the holy goost : so shall ye Iewes at Ierusalem bynde the man yt oweth this gerdell and shall delyver him into the hondes of the gentyls .
44021012	When we hearde this both we and other of the same place besought him that he wolde not goo vp to Ierusalem .
44021013	Then Paul answered and sayde : what do ye wepynge and breakinge myne hert ? I am redy not to be bound only but also to dye at Ierusalem for ye name of ye Lorde Iesu .
44021014	When we coulde not turne his mynde we ceased sayinge : the will of ye Lorde be fulfilled .
44021015	After those dayes we made oure selfes redy and went vp to Ierusalem .
44021016	There went with vs also certayne of his disciples of Cesarea and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus an olde disciple with whom we shuld lodge .
44021017	And when we were come to Ierusalem the brethren receaved vs gladly .
44021018	And on the morowe Paul wet in with vs vnto Iames . And all the elders came to geder .
44021019	And when he had saluted them he tolde by order all thinges that God had wrought amoge the getyls by his ministracion .
44021020	And when they hearde it they glorified the Lorde and sayde vnto him : thou seist brother how many thousande Iewes ther are which beleve and they are all zelous over ye lawe .
44021021	And they are informed of the that thou teachest all the Iewes which are amoge the gentyls to forsake Moses and sayst that they ought not to circumcise their chyldren nether to live after the customes .
44021022	What is it therfore ? The multitude must nedes come togeder . For they shall heare that thou arte come .
44021023	Do therfore this that we saye to the . We have . iiii . men which have a vowe on them .
44021024	Them take and purifye thy selfe with them and do cost on them that they maye shave their heeddes and all shall knowe yt tho thinges which they have hearde concerninge the are nothinge : but that thou thy selfe also walkest and kepest the lawe .
44021025	For as touchinge the gentyls which beleve we have written and concluded yt they observe no soche thinges : but that they kepe them selves from thinges offred to ydoles from bloud fro strangled and fro fornicacion .
44021026	Then the nexte daye Paul toke the men and purified him selfe with them and entred into the teple declaringe that he observed the dayes of ye purificacio vntyll that an offeringe shuld be offred for every one of them .
44021027	And as the seven dayes shuld have bene ended ye Iewes which were of Asia when they sawe him in the teple they moved all the people and layde hondes on him
44021028	cryinge : men of Israel helpe . This is the man that teacheth all men every where agaynst the people and the lawe and this place . Moreover also he hath brought Grekes into the teple and hath polluted this holy place .
44021029	For they sawe one Trophimus an Ephesian with him in the cyte . Him they supposed Paul had brought into the teple .
44021030	And all the cyte was moved and the people swarmed to geder . And they toke Paul and drue him out of the teple and forthwith the dores were shut to .
44021031	As they went about to kyll him tydinges came vnto the hye captayne of the soudiers that all Ierusalem was moved .
44021032	Which immediatly toke soudiers and vndercaptaynes and ranne doune vnto them . When they sawe ye vpper captayne and the soudiers they lefte smytinge of Paul .
44021033	Then the captayne came neare and toke him and comaunded him to be bounde with two chaynes and demaunded what he was and what he had done .
44021034	And one cryed this another that amoge the people . And whe he coulde not knowe the certayntie for ye rage he comaunded him to be caryed into the castle .
44021035	And whe he came vnto a grece it fortuned that he was borne of the soudiers of the violence of the people .
44021036	For the multitude of the people folowed after cryinge : awaye wt him .
44021037	And as Paul shuld have bene caryed into the castle he sayde vnto the hye Captayne : maye I speake vnto the ? Which sayde : canst thou speake Greke ?
44021038	Arte not thou that Egypcian which before these dayes made an vproure and ledde out into the wildernes . iiii . thousande men that were mortherers ?
44021039	But Paul sayde : I am a ma which am a Iewe of Tharsus a cite in Cicill a Citesyn of no vyle cite I beseche ye soffre me to speake vnto ye people .
44021040	When he had geve him licece Paul stode on ye steppes and beckned with the honde vuto the people and ther was made a greate silence . And he spake vnto the in ye Ebrue tonge sayinge :
44022001	Ye men brethre and fathers heare myne answere which I make vnto you .
44022002	Whe they hearde that he spake in ye Ebrue tonge to them they kept the moore silence . And he sayde :
44022003	I am verely aman which am a Iewe borne in Tharsus a cite in Cicill : neverthelesse yet brought vp in this cite at ye fete of Gamaliel and informed diligently in the lawe of the fathers and was fervent mynded to Godwarde as ye all are this same daye
44022004	and I persecuted this waye vnto the deeth byndynge and delyveringe into preson bothe men and wemen
44022005	as the chefe prest doth beare me witnes and all the elders : of whom also I receaved letters vnto the brethren and wet to Damasco to bringe them which were there bounde vnto Ierusalem for to be punysshed .
44022006	And it fortuned as I made my iorney and was come nye vnto Damasco aboute none yt sodenly ther shone fro heaven a greate lyght rounde aboute me
44022007	and I fell vnto the erth and hearde a voyce sayinge vnto me : Saul Saul why persecutest thou me ?
44022008	And I answered : what arte thou Lorde ? And he sayd vnto me : I am Iesus of Nazareth whom thou persecutest .
44022009	And they that were with me sawe verely a lyght and were a frayde : but they hearde not the voyce of him that spake with me .
44022010	And I sayde : what shall I do Lorde ? And the Lorde sayde vnto me : Aryse and goo into Damasco and there it shalbe tolde the of all thinges which are apoynted for the to do .
44022011	And when I sawe nothynge for the brightnes of that light I was ledde by the honde of them that were with me and came into Damasco .
44022012	And one Ananias a perfect man and as pertayninge to the lawe havinge good reporte of all the Iewes which there dwelt
44022013	came vnto me and stode and sayd vnto me : Brother Saul loke vp . And that same houre I receaved my sight and sawe him .
44022014	And he sayde the God of oure fathers hath ordeyned the before that thou shuldest knowe his will and shuldest se that which is rightfull and shuldest heare the voyce of his mouth :
44022015	for thou shalt be his witnes vnto all men of tho thinges which thou thou hast sene and hearde .
44022016	And now : why tariest thou ? Aryse and be baptised and wesshe awaye thy synnes in callinge on ye name of ye Lorde .
44022017	And it fortuned when I was come agayne to Ierusalem and prayde in the teple yt I was in a trauce
44022018	and sawe him sayinge vnto me . Make haste and get the quickly out of Ierusalem : for they will not receave thy witnes yt thou bearest of me .
44022019	And I sayde : Lorde they knowe that I presoned and bet in every synagoge them that beleved on the .
44022020	And when the bloud of thy witnes Steven was sheed I also stode by and consented vnto his deeth and kept the rayment of them that slewe him .
44022021	And he sayde vnto me : departe for I will sende the a farre hence vnto the Gentyls .
44022022	They gave him audience vnto this worde and then lifte vp their voyces and sayde : a waye wt soche a felowe fro the erth : yt is pitie that he shuld live .
44022023	And as they cryed and cast of their clothes and thrue dust into ye ayer
44022024	ye captayne bade him to be brought into the castle and commaunded him to be scourged and to be examined that he myght knowe wherfore they cryed on him .
44022025	And as they bounde him with thoges Paul sayde vnto the Centurion that stode by : Ys it laufull for you to scourge a man that is a Romain and vncondempned ?
44022026	When the Centurion hearde that he went and tolde the vpper captayne sayinge : What intendest thou to do ? This man is a Romayne .
44022027	Then the vpper captayne came and sayde to him : tell me art thou a Romayne ? He sayde : Yee .
44022028	And the captayne answered : with a greate some obtayned I this fredome . And Paul sayde : I was fre borne .
44022029	Then strayght waye departed from him they which shuld have examyned him . And the hye captayne also was a frayde after he knewe that he was a Romayne : because he had bounde him .
44022030	On the morowe because he wolde have knowen the certayntie wherfore he was accused of the Iewes he lowsed him from his bondes and commaunded the hye Prestes and all the counsell to come together and brought Paul and set him before them .
44023001	Paul behelde the counsell and sayde : men and brethre I have lived in all good coscience before God vntill this daye .
44023002	The hye prest Ananias comaunded the that stode by to smyte him on the mouth .
44023003	Then sayde Paul to him : God smyte the thou payntyd wall . Sittest thou and iudgest me after the lawe : and commaundest me to be smytten contrary to the lawe ?
44023004	And they that stode by sayde : revylest thou Goddes hye preste ?
44023005	Then sayd Paul : I wist not brethren that he was the hye preste . For it is writte thou shalt not curse the rular of thy people .
44023006	When Paul perceaved that the one parte were Saduces and the other Pharises : he cryed oute in the counsell . Men and brethren I am a Pharisaye the sonne of a Pharisaye . Of the hope and resurreccion fro deeth I am iudged .
44023007	And when he had so sayde ther arose a debate bitwene the Pharisayes and ye Saduces and the multitude was devided .
44023008	For ye Saduces saye that ther is no resurreccio nether angell nor sprete . But the Pharisayes graunt bothe .
44023009	And ther arose a great crye and the Scribes which were of the Pharisayes parte arose and strove sayinge : we fynde none evyll in this man . Though a sprete or an angell hath apered to him let vs not stryve agaynst God .
44023010	And when ther arose greate debate the captayne fearynge lest Paul shuld have bene pluckt asondre of them comaunded the soudiers to goo doune and to take him from amonge them and to bringe him into the castle .
44023011	The nyght folowyng God stode by him and sayde : Be of good cheare Paul : for as thou hast testified of me in Ierusalem so must thou beare witnes at Rome .
44023012	When daye was come certayne of the Iewes gaddered them selves to geder and made a vowe sayinge that they wolde nether eate nor drinke till they had killed Paul .
44023013	They were aboute . xl . which had made this conspiracio .
44023014	And they cam to ye chefe prestes and elders and sayde : we have boude oure selves with a vowe that we will eate nothinge vntill we have slayne Paul .
44023015	Now therfore geve ye knowlege to the vpper captayne and to the counsell that he bringe him forth vnto vs to morow as though we wolde knowe some thinge more perfectly of him . But we ( or ever he come neare ) are redy in ye meane season to kill him .
44023016	When Pauls sisters sonne hearde of their layinge awayte he wet and entred into the castle and tolde Paul .
44023017	And Paul called one of ye vnder captaynes vnto him and sayde : bringe this younge man vnto ye hye captayne : for he hath a certayne thinge to shewe him .
44023018	And he toke him and sayd : Paul ye presoner called me vnto him and prayed me to brige this youge ma vnto ye which hath a certayne matter to shewe ye .
44023019	The hye captayne toke him by the hond and wet a parte with him out of the waye : and axed him : what hast thou to saye vnto me ?
44023020	And he sayd : the Iewes are determined to desyre the yt thou woldest brynge forth Paul to morowe into the counsell as though they wolde enquyre somwhat of him more parfectly .
44023021	But folowe not their mindes : for ther lyein wayte for him of the moo then . xl . men which have boude the selves wt a vowe that they will nether eate ner drinke till they have killed him . And now are they redy and loke for thy promes .
44023022	The vpper captayne let ye yoge man departe and charged : se thou tell it out to no man that thou hast shewed these thinges to me .
44023023	And he called vnto him two vnder captaynes sayinge : make redy two hondred soudiers to goo to Cesarea and horsmen threscore and ten and speare men two houndred at the thyrde houre of the nyght .
44023024	And delyvre them beastes that they maye put Paul on and bringe him safe vnto Felix the hye debite
44023025	and wrote a letter in this maner .
44023026	Claudius Lisias vnto ye most mighty rular Felix sendeth gretinges .
44023027	This man was take of the Iewes and shuld have bene killed of them . Then cam I with soudiers and rescued him and perceaved that he was a Romayne .
44023028	And when I wolde have knowen the cause wherfore they accused him I brought him forth into their cousell .
44023029	There perceaved I yt he was accused of questios of their lawe : but was not giltye of eny thinge worthy of deeth or of bondes .
44023030	Afterwarde when it was shewed me how that ye Iewes layde wayte for ye man I sent him strayght waye to the and gave commaundmet to his accusars yf they had ought agaynst him to tell it vnto ye : fare well .
44023031	Then ye soudiers as it was comaunded the toke Paul and brought him by nyght to Antipatras .
44023032	On the morowe they lefte horsmen to goo with him and returned vnto the castle .
44023033	Which when they cam to Cesarea they delivered the epistle to the debite and presented Paul before him .
44023034	When the debite had redde the letter he axed of what countre he was and when he vnderstode that he was of Cicill
44023035	I will heare the ( sayde he ) whe thyne accusars are come also : and commaunded him to be kepte in Herodes pallys .
44024001	After . v . dayes Ananias the hye preste descended with elders and with a certayne Oratour named Tartullus and enformed the ruelar of Paul .
44024002	When Paul was called forth Tartullus beganne to accuse him saying : Seynge yt we live in great quyetnes by the meanes of the and that many good thinges are done vnto this nacion thorow thy providence :
44024003	that alowe we ever and in all places most myghty Felix with all thankes .
44024004	Notwithstondinge that I be not tedeous vnto the I praye the that thou woldest heare vs of thy curtesy a feawe wordes .
44024005	We have founde this ma a pestilent felowe and a mover of debate vnto all the Iewes thorowe out the worlde and a mayntayner of ye secte of the Nazarites
44024006	and hath also enforsed to pollute the temple . Whom we toke and wolde have iudged acordinge to oure lawe :
44024007	but the hye captayne Lisias came vpon vs and with great violence toke him awaye out of oure hodes
44024008	comaundinge his accusars to come vnto the . Of who thou mayst ( yf thou wilt enquyre ) knowe the certayne of all these thinges where of we accuse him .
44024009	The Iewes lyke wyse affermed sayinge that it was even so .
44024010	Then Paul ( after that the rular him selfe had beckened vnto him that he shuld speake ) answered : I shall with a moare quyet minde answere for my selfe for as moche as I vnderstonde yt thou hast bene of many yeares a iudge vnto this people
44024011	because that thou mayst knowe yt there are yet . xii . dayes sence I went vp to Ierusalem for to praye
44024012	and that they nether founde me in the teple disputinge with eny man other raysinge vp the people nether in the Synagoges nor in the cite .
44024013	Nether can they prove ye thinges wher of they accuse me .
44024014	But this I confesse vnto ye that after that waye ( which they call heresy ) so worshippe I the God of my fathers belevinge all thinges which are writte in the lawe and ye Prophetes
44024015	and have hope towardes God that ye same resurreccion from deeth ( which they them selves loke for also ) shalbe both of iust and vniust .
44024016	And therfore stody I to have a cleare consciece towarde God and toward man also .
44024017	But after many yeres I came and brought almes to my people and offeringes
44024018	in the which they founde me purified in the teple nether with multitude nor yet wt vnquyetnes How beit there were certayne Iewes out of Asia
44024019	which ought to be here present before the and accuse me yf they had ought agaynst me :
44024020	or els let these same here saye if they have founde eny evyll doinge in me whill I stonde here in ye counsell :
44024021	except it be for this one voyce yt I cryed stondinge amoge the of the resurreccion fro deeth am I iudged of you this daye .
44024022	When Felix hearde these thinges he deferde them for he knewe very well of yt waye and sayde : when Lisias the captayne is come I will know the vtmost of youre matters .
44024023	And he commaunded an vndercaptayne to kepe Paul and that he shuld have rest and that he shuld forbyd none of his aquayntauce to minister vnto him or to come vnto him .
44024024	And after a certayne dayes ca Felix and his wyfe Drusilla which was a Iewas and called forth Paul and hearde him of the fayth which is toward Christ .
44024025	And as he preached of righteousnes temperauce and iudgement to come Felix trembled and answered : thou hast done ynough at this tyme departe when I have a conveniet tyme I will sende for the .
44024026	He hoped also that money shuld have bene geven him of Paul that he myght lowse him : wherfore he called him ye oftener and comened with him .
44024027	But after two yeare Festus Porcius came into Felix roume . And Felix willinge to shewe ye Iewes a pleasure lefte Paul in preson bounde .
44025001	When Festus was come into the province after thre dayes he ascended fro Cesarea vnto Ierusalem .
44025002	Then enformed him the hye prestes and the chefe of the Iewes of Paul . And they besought him
44025003	and desired faveour agaynst him that he wold sende for him to Ierusalem : and layde awayte for him in the waye to kill him .
44025004	Festus answered that Paul shuld be kept at Cesarea : but that he him selfe wold shortly departe thither .
44025005	Let the therfore ( sayd he ) which amoge you are able to do it come doune with vs and accuse him if ther be eny faute in the man .
44025006	When he had taried there moare then ten dayes he departed vnto Cesarea and the nexte daye sate doune in the iudgemet seate and commaunded Paul to be brought .
44025007	When he was come the Iewes which were come fro Ierusalem came aboute him and layde many and greveous complayntes agaynst Paul which they coulde not prove
44025008	as longe as he answered for him selfe that he had nether agaynst the lawe of the Iewes nether agaynst the temple nor yet agaynst Cesar offended eny thinge at all .
44025009	Festus willinge to do the Iewes a pleasure answered Paul and sayde : wilt thou goo to Ierusalem and there be iudged of these thinges before me ?
44025010	Then sayd Paul : I stonde at Cesars iudgemet seate where I ought to be iudged . To ye Iewes have I no harme done as thou verely well knowest .
44025011	If I have hurte them or comitted eny thinge worthy of deeth I refuse not to dye . If none of these thinges are where of they accuse me no man owght to delyver me to them . I appeale vnto Cesar .
44025012	Then spake Festus with deliberacion and answered . Thou hast appealed vnto Cesar : vnto Cesar shalt thou goo .
44025013	After a certayne dayes kinge Agrippa and Bernice came vnto Cesarea to salute Festus .
44025014	And when they had bene there a good ceason Festus rehersed Paules cause vnto ye kynge sayinge : ther is a certayne man left in preson of Felix
44025015	about whom when I came to Ierusalem the hye prestes and elders of the Iewes enformed me and desyred to have iudgement agaynst him .
44025016	To whom I answered : It is not the maner of the Romayns to delyver eny man that he shuld perisshe before that he which is accused have the accusars before him and have licence to answer for him selfe concerninge ye cryme layde agaynst him :
44025017	whe they were come hidder wt out delaye on the morowe I sate to geve iudgement and comaunded ye ma to be brought forthe .
44025018	Agaynst who when ye accusers stode vp they brought none accusacion of soche thinges as I supposed :
44025019	but had certayne questions agaynst him of their awne supersticion and of one Iesus which was ded : whom Paul affirmed to be alyve .
44025020	And be cause I douted of soche maner questions I axed him whyther he wolde goo to Ierusalem and there be iudged of these matters .
44025021	Then when Paul had appealed to be kept vnto the knowledge of Cesar I commaunded him to be kept tyll I myght sende him to Cesar .
44025022	Agrippa sayd vnto Festus : I wolde also heare ye man my selfe . To morowe ( sayde he ) thou shalt heare him .
44025023	And on ye morowe when Agrippa was come and Bernice with greate pompe and were entred into the counsell housse with the captaynes and chefe men of the cite at Festus commaundement Paul was brought forth .
44025024	And Festus sayde : kynge Agrippa and all men which are heare present wt vs : ye se this man about whom all the multitude of the Iewes have bene with me both at Ierusalem and also here cryinge that he ought not to lyve eny lenger .
44025025	Yet founde I nothinge worthy of deeth that he had comitted . Neverthelesse seinge that he hath appealed to Cesar I have determined to sende him .
44025026	Of whom I have no certayne thinge to wryte vnto my lorde . Wherfore I have brought him vnto you and specially vnto the kynge Agrippa that after examinacion had I myght have sumwhat to wryte .
44025027	For me thynketh it vnreasonable for to sende a presoner and not to shewe the causes which are layde agaynst him .
44026001	Agrippa sayde vnto Paul : thou arte permitted to speake for thy selfe . Then Paul stretched forth the honde and answered for him selfe .
44026002	I thynke my selfe happy kynge Agrippa because I shall answere this daye before the of all the thinges wherof I am accused of ye Iewes
44026003	namely because thou arte experte in all customes and questions which are amonge the Iewes . Wherfore I beseche the to heare me paciently .
44026004	My lyvynge of a chylde which was at the fyrst amoge myne awne nacion at Ierusalem knowe all the Iewes
44026005	which knew me from ye beginnynge yf they wolde testifie it . For after the most straytest secte of oure laye lyved I a pharisaye .
44026006	And now I stond and am iudged for the hope of the promes made of God vnto oure fathers :
44026007	vnto which promes oure . xii . tribes instantly servynge God daye and nyght hope to come . For which hopes sake kynge Agrippa am I accused of the Iewes .
44026008	Why shuld it be thought a thinge vncredible vnto you that god shuld rayse agayne the deed ?
44026009	I also verely thought in my selfe that I ought to do many cotrary thinges clene agaynst the name of Iesus of Nazareth :
44026010	which thinge I also dyd in Ierusalem . Where many of the sainctes I shut vp in preson and had receaved auctorite of ye hye prestes . And whe they were put to deeth I gave the sentence .
44026011	And I punysshed them ofte in every synagoge and compelled them to blaspheme : and was yet more mad apon them and persecuted the even vnto straunge cities .
44026012	About the which thinges as I went to Damasco with auctorite and licence of the hye Prestes
44026013	even at myddaye ( o kynge ) I sawe in ye waye a lyght from heven above the brightnes of the sunne shyne rounde about me and them which iorneyed with me .
44026014	When we were all fallen to the erth I hearde a voyce speakynge vnto me and sayinge in ye Hebrue tonge : Saul Saul why persecutest thou me ? It is harde for the to kicke agaynste the pricke .
44026015	And I sayde : Who arte thou lorde ? And he sayde I am Iesus whom thou persecutest .
44026016	But ryse and stond vp on thy fete . For I have apered vnto the for this purpose to make the a minister and a witnes both of tho thinges which thou hast sene and of tho thinges in the which I will appere vnto the
44026017	delyverynge the from the people and from ye gentyls vnto which nowe I sende the
44026018	to open their eyes that they myght turne from darcknes vnto lyght and from the power of Satan vnto God that they maye receave forgevenes of synnes and inheritauce amonge the which are sanctified by fayth in me .
44026019	Wherfore kynge Agrippa I was not disobedient vnto the hevenly vision :
44026020	but shewed fyrst vnto them of Damasco and at Ierusalem and thorow out all the costes of Iewry and to the gentyls that they shuld repent and turne to God and do the ryght workes of repentaunce .
44026021	For this cause the Iewes caught me in the temple and went about to kyll me .
44026022	Neverthelesse I obtayned helpe of God and cotynew vnto this daye witnessyng bothe to small and to greate saying none other thinges then those which the prophetes and Moses dyd saye shuld come
44026023	that Christ shulde suffre and that he shuld be the fyrst that shulde ryse from deeth and shuld shewe lyght vnto the people and the gentyls .
44026024	As he thus answered for him selfe : Festus sayde with a lowde voyce : Paul thou arte besides thy selfe . Moche learnynge hath made the mad .
44026025	And Paul sayde : I am not mad most dere Festus : but speake the wordes of trueth and sobernes .
44026026	The kynge knoweth of these thinges before whom I speke frely : nether thynke I that eny of these thinges are hydden fro him . For this thinge was not done in a corner .
44026027	Kynge Agrippa belevest thou ye prophetes ? I wote well thou belevest .
44026028	Agrippa sayde vnto Paul : Sumwhat thou bringest me in mynde for to be come a Christen .
44026029	And Paul sayd : I wolde to God that not only thou : but also all that heare me to daye were not sumwhat only but altogeder soche as I am except these bondes .
44026030	And when he had thus spoken the kynge rose vp and the debite and Bernice and they that sate with them .
44026031	And when they were gone aparte they talked betwene them selves sayinge : This man doeth nothinge worthy of deeth nor of bondes .
44026032	Then sayde Agrippa vnto Festus : This man myght have bene lowsed yf he had not appealed vnto Cesar .
44027001	When it was cocluded that we shuld sayle into Italy they delivered Paul and certayne other presoners vnto one named Iulius an vnder captayne of Cesars soudiars .
44027002	And we entred into a ship of Adramicium and lowsed from lond apoynted to sayle by the costes of Asia one Aristarcus out of Macedonia of the contre of Thessalia beinge with vs .
44027003	And the nexte daye we came to Sidon . And Iulius courteously entreated Paul and gave him liberte to goo vnto his frendes and to refresshe him selfe .
44027004	And from thence lanched we and sayled harde by Cypers because the wyndes were contrarye .
44027005	Then sayled we over the see of Cilicia and Pamphylia and came to Myra a cite in Lycia .
44027006	And there ye vnder captayne founde a shippe of Alexander redy to sayle into Italy and put vs therin .
44027007	And when we had sayled slowly many dayes and scace were come over agaynst Gnydon ( because the wynde with stode vs ) we sayled harde by the costes of Candy over agaynste Salmo
44027008	and with moche worke sayled beyonde yt and came vnto a place called good porte . Nye whervnto was a citie called Lasea .
44027009	When moche tyme was spent and saylinge was now ieoperdeous because also that we had overlonge fasted Paul put them in remembraunce
44027010	and sayde vnto them Syrs I perceave that this vyage wilbe with hurte and moche domage not of the ladynge and ship only : but also of oure lyves .
44027011	Neverthelather the vndercaptayne beleved the governer and the master better then tho thinges which were spoken of Paul .
44027012	And because the haven was not comodius to wynter in many toke counsell to departe thence yf by eny meanes they myght attayne to Phenices and there to wynter which is an haven of Candy and servith to the southwest and northwest wynde .
44027013	When the south wynde blewe they supposynge to obtayne their purpose lowsed vnto Asson and sayled paste all Candy .
44027014	But anone after ther arose agaynste their purpose a flawe of wynde out of the northeeste .
44027015	And when the ship was caught and coulde not resist the wynde we let her goo and drave with the wether .
44027016	And we came vnto an yle named Clauda and had moche worke to come by abote
44027017	which they toke vp and vsed helpe vndergerdynge the shippe fearynge lest we shuld have fallen into Syrtes and we let doune a vessell and so were caryed .
44027018	The nexte daye when we were tossed wt an exceadynge tempest they lyghtened ye ship
44027019	and the thyrde daye we cast out with oure awne hondes the tacklynge of the shippe .
44027020	When at the last nether sunne nor starre in many dayes appered and no small tempest laye apon vs all hope that we shuld be saved was then taken awaye .
44027021	Then after longe abstinence Paul stode forth in the myddes of them and sayde : Syrs ye shulde have harkened to me and not have lowsed from Candy nether to have brought vnto vs this harme and losse .
44027022	And nowe I exhorte you to be of good chere . For ther shalbe no losse of eny mas lyfe amonge you save of the ship only .
44027023	For ther stode by me this nyght the angell of God whose I am and whom I serve
44027024	sayinge : feare not Paul for thou must be brought before Cesar . And lo God hath geven vnto the all that sayle with ye .
44027025	Wherfore Syrs be of good chere : for I beleve God that so it shalbe even as it was tolde me .
44027026	How be it we must be cast into a certayne ylonde .
44027027	But when ye fourtethe nyght was come as we were caryed in Adria about mydnyght the shipmen demed that ther appered some countre vnto the :
44027028	and sounded and founde it . xx . feddoms . And when they had gone a lytell further they sounded agayne and founde . xv . feddoms .
44027029	Then fearinge lest they shuld have fallen on some Rocke they cast . iiii . ancres out of the sterne and wysshed for ye daye .
44027030	As the shipmen were about to fle out of the ship and had let doune the bote into the see vnder a coloure as though they wolde have cast ancres out of the forshippe :
44027031	Paul sayd vnto ye vnder captayne and the soudiers : excepte these abyde in the ship ye cannot be safe .
44027032	Then the soudiers cut of the rope of the bote and let it fall awaye .
44027033	And in ye meane tyme betwixt that and daye Paul besought them all to take meate sayinge : this is ye fourtenthe daye that ye have taried and continued fastynge receavinge nothinge at all .
44027034	Wherfore I praye you to take meate : for this no dout is for youre helth : for ther shall not an heere fall fro the heed of eny of you .
44027035	And when he had thus spoke he toke breed and gave thankes to God in presence of the all and brake it and begane to eate .
44027036	Then were they all of good cheare and they also toke meate .
44027037	We were all together in ye ship two hundred thre score and sixtene soules .
44027038	And whe they had eate ynough they lightened ye ship and cast out the wheate into the see .
44027039	Whe yt was daye they knew not ye lande but they spied a certayne haven with a banke into ye which they were mynded ( yf yt were possible ) to thrust in the ship .
44027040	And when they had taken vp the ancres they comytted them selves vnto the see and lowsed the rudder bondes and hoysed vp ye mayne sayle to the wynde and drue to londe .
44027041	But they chaunsed on a place which had the see on bothe the sydes and thrust in the ship . And the foore parte stucke fast and moved not but ye hynder brake with the violence of the waves .
44027042	The soudears counsell was to kyll ye presoners lest eny of them when he had swome out shulde fle awaye .
44027043	But the vndercaptayne willinge to save Paul kept the from their purpose and commaunded that they yt could swyme shulde cast the selves first in to ye see and scape to londe .
44027044	And the other he comaunded to goo some on bordes and some on broken peces of the ship . And so it came to passe that they came all safe to londe .
44028001	And when they were scaped then they knewe that the yle was called Milete .
44028002	And the people of the countre shewed vs no lytell kyndnes : for they kyndled a fyre and receaved vs every one because of the present rayne and because of colde .
44028003	And when Paul had gaddered a boundle of stickes and put them into the fyre ther came a viper out of the heet and lept on his honde .
44028004	When the men of the contre sawe the worme hange on his honde they sayde amonge the selves : this man must nedes be a mortherer . Whome ( though he have escaped the see ) yet vengeaunce suffreth not to lyve .
44028005	But he shouke of the vermen into the fyre and felt no harme .
44028006	Howbeit they wayted when he shuld have swolne or fallen doune deed sodenly . But after they had loked a greate whyle and sawe no harme come to him they chaunged their myndes and sayde that he was a God .
44028007	In the same quarters the chefe man of the yle whose name was Publius had a lordshippe : the same receaved vs and lodged vs thre dayes courteously .
44028008	And it fortuned that the father of Publius laye sicke of a fiever and of a bluddy flixe . To who Paul entred in and prayde and layde his hondes on him and healed him .
44028009	When this was done other also which had diseases in the yle came and were healed .
44028010	And they dyd vs gret honoure . And when we departed they laded vs with thinges necessary .
44028011	After thre monethes we departed in a ship of Alexandry which had wyntred in the yle whose badge was Castor and Pollux .
44028012	And whe we came to Cyracusa we taryed there . iii . dayes .
44028013	And from thence we set a compasse and came to Regium . And after one daye the south wynde blewe and we came the next daye to Putiolus :
44028014	where we founde brethren and were desyred to tary with them seven dayes and so came to Rome .
44028015	And from thence when ye brethren hearde of vs they came agaynst vs to Apiphorum and to ye thre taverns . When Paul sawe the he thanked God and wexed bolde .
44028016	And when he came to Rome ye vnder captayne delyvered ye presoners to ye chefe captayne of ye host : but Paul was suffered to dwell by him selfe with one soudier that kept him .
44028017	And it fortuned after thre dayes that Paul called ye chefe of ye Iewes together . And whe they were come he sayde vnto the : Men and brethren though I have comitted nothinge agaynst the people or lawes of oure fathers : yet was I delyvered presoner from Ierusalem in to the hondes of ye Romayns .
44028018	Which when they had examined me wolde have let me goo because they founde no cause of deeth in me .
44028019	But when ye Iewes cryed cotrary I was constrayned to appeale vnto Cesar : not because I had ought to accuse my people of .
44028020	For this cause have I called for you eve to se you and to speake with you : because that for the hope of Israel I am bounde with this chayne .
44028021	And they sayde vnto him : We nether receaved letters out of Iewry pertayninge vnto ye nether came eny of the brethren that shewed or spake eny harme of the .
44028022	But we will heare of the what thou thynkest . For we have hearde of this secte that every wheare it is spoken agaynst .
44028023	And when they had apoynted him a daye ther came many vnto him into his lodgynge . To whom he expounded and testifyed the kyngdome of God and preached vnto the of Iesu : both out of the lawe of Moses and also out of the prophetes even from mornynge to nyght .
44028024	And some beleved ye thinges which were spoken and some beleved not .
44028025	When they agreed not amonge the selves they departed after that Paul had spoken one worde . Well spake the holy goost by Esay ye prophet vnto oure fathers
44028026	sayinge : Goo vnto this people and saye : with youre eares shall ye heare and shall not vnderstonde : and with youre eyes shall ye se and shall not perceave .
44028027	For the hert of this people is wexed grosse and their eares were thycke of hearynge and their eyes have they closed : lest they shuld se with their eyes and heare with their eares and vnderstonde with their hertes and shuld be converted and I shulde heale them .
44028028	Be it knowen therfore vnto you that this salvacion of God is sent to the gentyls and they shall heare it .
44028029	And when he had sayde that the Iewes departed and had grete despicios amonge them selves .
44028030	And Paul dwelt two yeares full in his lodgynge and receaved all that came to him
44028031	preachyng the kyngdome of God and teachynge those thinges which concerned the lorde Iesus with all confidence vnforboden .
45001001	Paul the seruaut of Iesus Christ called to be an Apostle put a parte to preache the Gospell of God
45001002	which he promysed afore by his Prophetes in the holy scriptures
45001003	that make mension of his sonne the which was begotte of the seed of David as pertayninge to the flesshe :
45001004	and declared to be the sonne of God with power of the holy goost that sanctifieth sence ye tyme that Iesus Christ oure Lorde rose agayne from deeth
45001005	by whom we have receaved grace and apostleshyppe to bringe all maner hethe people vnto obedience of the fayth that is in his name :
45001006	of the which hethen are ye a part also which are Iesus christes by vocacio .
45001007	To all you of Rome beloved of God and saynctes by callinge . Grace be with you and peace from God oure father and from the Lorde Iesus Christ .
45001008	Fyrst verely I thanke my God thorow Iesus Christ for you all because youre fayth is publisshed through out all the worlde .
45001009	For God is my witnes whom I serve with my sprete in the Gospell of his sonne that with out ceasinge I make mencion of you alwayes in my prayers
45001010	besechinge that at one tyme or another a prosperous iorney ( by ye will of god ) myght fortune me to come vnto you .
45001011	For I longe to see you that I myght bestowe amoge you some spirituall gyfte to strength you with all :
45001012	that is that I myght have consolacion together with you through the commen fayth which bothe ye and I have .
45001013	I wolde that ye shuld knowe brethre how that I have often tymes purposed to come vnto you ( but have bene let hitherto ) to have some frute amonge you as I have amonge other of ye Gentyls .
45001014	For I am detter both to the Grekes and to them which are no Grekes vnto the learned and also vnto the vnlearned .
45001015	Lykewyse as moche as in me is I am redy to preache the Gospell to you of Rome also .
45001016	For I am not ashamed of the Gospell of Christ because it is ye power of God vnto salvacio to all yt beleve namely to the Iewe and also to ye getyle .
45001017	For by it ye rightewesnes which cometh of god is opened fro fayth to fayth . As it is written : The iust shall live by fayth .
45001018	For the wrath of God apereth from heven agaynst all vngodlynes and vnrightewesnes of me which withholde ye trueth in vnrightewesnes
45001019	seynge what maye be knowen of God that same is manifest amoge them . For God dyd shewe it vnto them .
45001020	So that his invisible thinges : that is to saye his eternall power and godhed are vnderstonde and sene by the workes from the creacion of the worlde . So that they are without excuse
45001021	in as moche as when they knewe god they glorified him not as God nether were thakfull but wexed full of vanities in their imaginacions and their folisshe hertes were blynded .
45001022	When they couted them selves wyse they became foles
45001023	and turned the glory of the immortall god vnto the similitude of the ymage of mortall man and of byrdes and foure foted beastes and of serpentes .
45001024	Wherfore god lykewyse gave the vp vnto their hertes lustes vnto vnclennes to defyle their awne boddyes bitwene them selves :
45001025	which tourned his truthe vnto a lye and worshipped and served the creatures more then ye maker which is blessed for ever . Ame .
45001026	For this cause god gave them vp vnto shamfull lustes . For even their wemen did chaunge the naturall vse vnto the vnnaturall .
45001027	And lyke wyse also the men lefte the naturall vse of the woma and bret in their lustes one on another . And man with man wrought filthynes and receaved in them selves the rewarde of their erroure as it was accordinge .
45001028	And as it semed not good vnto them to be aknowen of God even so God delivered them vp vnto a leawde mynd yt they shuld do tho thinges which were not comly
45001029	beinge full of all vnrighteous doinge of fornicacio wickednes coveteousnes maliciousnes full of envie morther debate disseyte evill codicioned whisperers
45001030	backbyters haters of God doers of wroge proude bosters bringers vp of evyll thinges disobedient to father and mother
45001031	with out vnderstondinge covenaunte breakers vnlovinge trucebreakers and merciles .
45001032	Which me though they knew the rightewesnes of God how that they which soche thinges commyt are worthy of deeth yet not only do the same but also have pleasure in them that do them .
45002001	Therfore arte thou inexcusable o man whosoever thou be yt iudgest . For in ye same wherin thou iudgest another thou condemnest thy selfe . For thou that iudgest doest eve the same selfe thinges
45002002	But we are sure that the iudgement of God is accordinge to trueth agaynst them which commit soche thinges .
45002003	Thikest thou this O thou ma that iudgest them which do soche thinges and yet doest eve the very same yt thou shalt escape ye iudgemet of God ?
45002004	Ether despisest thou the riches of his goodnes paciece and longe sufferaunce ? and remembrest not how that the kyndnes of God ledith the to repentaunce ?
45002005	But thou after thyne harde herte yt canot repet heapest ye togedder the treasure of wrath agaynste the daye of vengeauce when shalbe opened ye rightewes iudgemet of god
45002006	which will rewarde every ma accordinge to his dedes :
45002007	that is to saye prayse honoure and immortalite to them which cotinue in good doynge and seke eternall lyfe .
45002008	But vnto them that are rebellious and disobey the trueth yet folowe iniquytie shall come indignacion and wrath
45002009	tribulacion and anguysshe vpon the soule of every man that doth evyll : of the Iewe fyrst and also of the gentyll .
45002010	To every man that doth good shall come prayse honoure and peace to ye Iewe fyrst and also to the gentyll .
45002011	For ther is no parcialyte with god . But whosoever hath synned with out lawe shall perisshe wt out lawe .
45002012	And as many as haue synned vnder the lawe shalbe iudged by the lawe .
45002013	For before god they are not ryghteous which heare ye lawe : but the doers of the lawe shalbe iustified .
45002014	For if the gentyls which have no lawe do of nature the thynges contayned in the lawe : then they havynge no lawe are a lawe vnto them selves
45002015	which shewe the dede of the lawe wrytten in their hertes : whyll their conscience beareth witnes vnto them and also their thoughtes accusynge one another or excusynge
45002016	at the daye when god shall iudge the secretes of men by Iesus Christ accordinge to my Gospell .
45002017	Beholde thou arte called a Iewe and trustest in the lawe and reioysist in God
45002018	and knowest his will and hast experience of good and bad in that thou arte informed by the lawe :
45002019	and belevest that thou thy silfe arte a gyde vnto the blynde a lyght to them which are in darcknes
45002020	an informer of them which lacke discrecio a teacher of vnlearned which hast the ensample of that which ought to be knowen and of the truth in the lawe .
45002021	But thou which teachest another teachest not thy selfe . Thou preachest a man shuld not steale : and yet thou stealest .
45002022	Thou sayst a man shuld not commit advoutry : and thou breakest wedlocke . Thou abhorrest ymages and robbest God of his honoure .
45002023	Thou reioysest in the lawe and thorow breakinge the lawe dishonourest God .
45002024	For the name of god is evyll spoken of amonge the Gentyls thorowe you as it is written .
45002025	Circumcisio verely avayleth if thou kepe the lawe . But if thou breake the lawe thy circumcision is made vncircumcision .
45002026	Therfore if the vncircumcised kepe the ryght thinges contayned in the lawe : shall not his vncircumcision be counted for circumcision ?
45002027	And shall not vncircumcision which is by nature ( yf it kepe the lawe ) iudge the which beynge vnder the letter and circumcision dost transgresse the lawe ?
45002028	For he is not a Iewe which is a Iewe out warde . Nether is that thynge circumcision which is outwarde in the flesshe .
45002029	But he is a Iewe which is hid wythin and the circucisio of ye herte is the true circumcision which is in the sprete and not in ye letter whose prayse is not of men but of god .
45003001	What preferment then hath the Iewe ? other what a vauntageth circumcision ?
45003002	Surely very moche . Fyrst vnto them was committed the worde of God
45003003	What then though some of them did not beleve ? shall their vnbeleve make the promes of god with out effecte ?
45003004	God forbid . Let god be true and all men lyars as it is written : That thou myghtest be iustifyed in thy sayinge and shuldest overcome when thou arte iudged .
45003005	Yf oure vnrightewesnes make the rightewesnes of God more excellent : what shall we saye ? Is God vnrighteous which taketh vengeauce ? I speake after the maner of me .
45003006	God forbid . For how then shall God iudge the worlde ?
45003007	Yf the veritie of God appere moare excellent thorow my lye vnto his prayse why am I hence forth iudged as a synner ?
45003008	and saye not rather ( as men evyll speake of vs and as some affirme that we saye ) let vs do evyll that good maye come therof . Whose damnacion is iuste .
45003009	What saye we then ? Are we better then they ? No in no wyse . For we have all ready proved how that both Iewes and Gentils are all vnder synne
45003010	as it is writte : There is none righteous no not one :
45003011	There is none that vnderstondith there is none yt seketh after God
45003012	they are all gone out of ye waye they are all made vnprofytable ther is none that doeth good no not one .
45003013	Their throte is an open sepulchre with their tounges they have disceaved : the poyson of Aspes is vnder their lippes .
45003014	Whose mouthes are full of coursynge and bitternes .
45003015	Their fete are swyfte to sheed bloud .
45003016	Destruccion and wretchednes are in their wayes .
45003017	And the waye of peace they have not knowen .
45003018	There is no feare of God before their eyes .
45003019	Ye and we knowe that whatsoever ye lawe sayth he sayth it to them which are vnder the lawe . That all mouthes maye be stopped and all the worlde be subdued to god
45003020	because that by ye dedes of the lawe shall no flesshe be iustified in the sight of God . For by the lawe commeth the knowledge of synne .
45003021	Now verely is ye rigtewesnes that cometh of God declared without the fulfillinge of ye lawe havinge witnes yet of ye lawe and of the Prophetes .
45003022	The rightewesnes no dout which is good before God cometh by ye fayth of Iesus Christ vnto all and vpon all that beleve . Ther is no differece :
45003023	for all have synned and lacke the prayse yt is of valoure before God :
45003024	but are iustified frely by his grace through the redemcion that is in Christ Iesu
45003025	whom God hath made a seate of mercy thorow faith in his bloud to shewe ye rightewesnes which before him is of valoure in yt he forgeveth ye synnes yt are passed which God dyd suffre
45003026	to shewe at this tyme ye rightewesnes yt is alowed of him yt he myght be couted iuste and a iustifiar of him which belevith on Iesus .
45003027	Where is then thy reioysinge ? It is excluded . By what lawe ? by ye lawe of workes ? Naye : but by the lawe of fayth .
45003028	For we suppose that a man is iustified by fayth without the dedes of ye lawe .
45003029	Is he the God of the Iewes only ? Is he not also the God of the Gentyls ? Yes eve of the Gentyles also .
45003030	For it is God only which iustifieth circumcision which is of fayth and vncircumcision thorow fayth .
45003031	Do we then destroye the lawe thorow fayth ? God forbid . But we rather mayntayne the lawe .
45004001	What shall we saye then that Abraham oure father as pertayninge to ye flesshe dyd finde ?
45004002	If Abraham were iustified by dedes the hath he wherin to reioyce : but not with god .
45004003	For what sayth the scripture ? Abraham beleved god and it was counted vnto him for rightewesnes .
45004004	To him that worketh is the rewarde not reckened of favour : but of duty .
45004005	To him that worketh not but beleveth on him that iustifieth the vngodly is his fayth counted for rightewesnes .
45004006	Even as David describeth the blessedfulnes of the man vnto whom god ascribeth rihgtewesnes without dedes .
45004007	Blessed are they whose vnrightewesnes are forgeven and whose synnes are covered .
45004008	Blessed is that ma to whom the Lorde imputeth not synne .
45004009	Came this blessednes then vpon the circumcised or vpon the vncircucised ? We saye verely how that fayth was rekened to Abraham for rightewesnes .
45004010	How was it rekened ? in the tyme of circumcision ? or in the tyme before he was circumcised ? Not in tyme of circucision : but when he was yet vncircumcised .
45004011	And he receaved the signe of circumcision as a seale of yt rightewesnes which is by fayth which fayth he had yet beynge vncircucised : that he shuld be the father of all them that beleve though they be not circumcised that rightewesnes myght be imputed to them also :
45004012	and that he myght be the father of the circumcised not because they are circumcised only : but because they walke also in the steppes of that fayth yt was in oure father Abraham before the tyme of circumcision .
45004013	For the promes that he shuld be the heyre of the worlde was not geven to Abraha or to his seed thorow the lawe : but thorow ye rightewesnes which cometh of fayth .
45004014	For yf they which are of the lawe be heyres then is fayth but vayne and the promes of none effecte .
45004015	Because the lawe causeth wrathe . For where no lawe is there is no trasgression .
45004016	Therfore by fayth is the inheritauce geven that it myght come of faveour : and the promes myght be sure to all the seed . Not to them only which are of the lawe : but also to them which are of the fayth of Abraham which is the father of vs all .
45004017	As it is wrytten : I have made the a father to many nacions even before god whom thou hast beleved which quyckeneth the deed and called those thinges which be not as though they were .
45004018	Which Abraham contrary to hope beleved in hope that he shuld be the father of many nacions accordynge to that which was spoken :
45004019	So shall thy seed be . And he faynted not in the fayth nor yet consydered hys awne body which was now deed even when he was almost an hondred yeare olde : nether yet that Sara was past chyldeberinge .
45004020	He stackered not at the promes of God thorow vnbelefe : but was made stronge in the fayth and gave honour to God
45004021	full certifyed that what he had promised that he was able to make good .
45004022	And therfore was it reckened to him for rightewesnes .
45004023	It is not written for him only that it was reckened to him for rightewesnes :
45004024	but also for vs to whom it shalbe counted for rightewesnes so we beleve on him that raysed vp Iesus oure Lorde from deeth .
45004025	Which was delivered for oure synnes and rose agayne forto iustifie vs .
45005001	Because therfore that we are iustified by fayth we are at peace with god thorow oure Lorde Iesue Christ :
45005002	by who we have awaye in thorow fayth vnto this grace wherin we stonde aud reioyce in hope of the prayse that shalbe geven of God .
45005003	Nether do we so only : but also we reioyce in tribulacion . For we know that tribulacion bringeth pacience
45005004	pacience bringeth experience experience bringeth hope .
45005005	And hope maketh not ashamed for the love of God is sheed abrod in oure hertes by the holy goost which is geven vnto vs .
45005006	For when we were yet weake accordynge to ye tyme : Christ dyed for vs which were vngodly .
45005007	Yet scace will eny man dye for a rightewes man . Paraventure for a good ma durst a man dye .
45005008	But God setteth out his love that he hath to vs seinge that whyll we were yet synners Christ dyed for vs .
45005009	Moche more then now ( seynge we are iustifyed in his bloud ) shall we be saved from wrath thorow him .
45005010	For yf when we were enemyes we were reconciled to God by the deeth of his sonne : moche more seinge we are reconciled we shal be preservid by his lyfe .
45005011	Not only so but we also ioye in God by the meanes of oure Lorde Iesus Christ by whom we have receavyd the attonment .
45005012	Wherfore as by one ma synne entred into the worlde and deeth by the meanes of synne . And so deeth went over all men in somoche that all men synned .
45005013	For even vnto the tyme of the lawe was synne in the worlde : but synne was not regarded as longe as ther was no lawe :
45005014	neverthelesse deeth rayned fro Adam to Moses eve over them also that synned not wt lyke transgression as dyd Adam : which is ye similitude of him that is to come .
45005015	But the gyfte is not lyke as the synne . For yf thorow the synne of one many be deed : moche more plenteous vpon many was the grace of God and gyfte by grace : which grace was geven by one man Iesus Christ .
45005016	And ye gifte is not over one synne as deeth cam thorow one synne of one yt synned . For damnacion cam of one synne vnto condemnacion : but the gyft cam to iustify fro many synnes .
45005017	For yf by the synne of one deeth raigned by the meanes of one moche more shall they which receave aboundance of grace and of the gyfte of rightewesnes raygne in lyfe by the meanes of one ( that is to saye ) Iesus Christ .
45005018	Lykewyse then as by the synne of one condemnacion cam on all men : eve so by the iustifyinge of one cometh the rightewesnes that bringeth lyfe vpo all men .
45005019	For as by one manes disobediece many be cam synners : so by ye obediece of one shall many be made righteous .
45005020	But ye lawe in the meane tyme entred in yt synne shuld encreace . Neverthelater where aboundaunce of synne was there was more plenteousnes of grace .
45005021	That as synne had raigned vnto deeth even so might grace raygne thorow rightewesnes vnto eternall lyfe by the helpe of Iesu Christ .
45006001	What shall we saye then ? Shall we continue in synne that there maye be aboundaunce of grace ?
45006002	God forbyd . How shall we that are deed as touchynge synne live eny lenger therin ?
45006003	Remember ye not that all we which are baptysed in the name of Iesu Christ are baptysed to dye with him ?
45006004	We are buryed with him by baptim for to dye that lykewyse as Christ was raysed vp from deeth by the glorye of the father : eve so we also shuld walke in a newe lyfe .
45006005	For yf we be graft in deeth lyke vnto him : even so must we be in the resurreccio .
45006006	This we must remeber that oure olde man is crucified with him also that the body of synne myght vtterly be destroyed that hence forth we shuld not be servauntes of synne .
45006007	For he that is deed ys iustified from synne .
45006008	Wherfore yf we be deed with Christ we beleve that we shall live with him :
45006009	remembringe that Christ once raysed fro deeth dyeth no more . Deeth hath no moare power over him .
45006010	For as touchynge that he dyed he dyed concernynge synne once . And as touchinge that he liveth he liveth vnto God .
45006011	Lykewyse ymagen ye also that ye are deed concernynge synne : but are alive vnto God thorow Iesus Christ oure Lorde .
45006012	Let not synne raygne therfore in youre mortall bodyes that ye shuld thervnto obey in the lustes of it .
45006013	Nether geve ye youre members as instrumentes of vnrightewesnes vnto synne : but geve youre selves vnto God as they that are alive from deeth . And geve youre membres as iustrumetes of rightewesnes vnto God .
45006014	Let not synne have power over you . For ye are not vnder the lawe but vnder grace .
45006015	What then ? Shall we synne because we are not vnder the lawe : but vnder grace ? God forbyd .
45006016	Remember ye not how yt to whom soever ye comit youre selves as servautes to obey his servauntes ye are to whom ye obey : whether it be of synne vnto deeth or of obedience vnto rightewesnes ?
45006017	God be thanked yt though ye were once the servauntes of synne ye have yet obeyed with herte vnto the forme of doctryne wher vnto ye were delyvered .
45006018	Ye are then made fre from synne and are be come the servauntes of rightewesnes .
45006019	I will speake grossly because of the infirmitie of youre flesshe . As ye have geve youre membres servauntes to vnclennes and to iniquitie fro iniquitie vnto iniquitie : even so nowe geve youre membres servantes vnto rightewesnes yt ye maye be sanctified .
45006020	For when ye were the servauntes of synne ye were not vnder rightewesnes .
45006021	What frute had ye then in tho thinges wher of ye are now ashamed . For the ende of tho thynges is deeth .
45006022	But now are ye delivered from synne and made the servauntes of God and have youre frute that ye shuld be sanctifyed and the ende everlastinge lyfe .
45006023	For the rewarde of synne is deeth : but eternall lyfe is the gyfte of God thorow Iesus Christ oure Lorde .
45007001	Remember ye not brethren ( I speake to them yt know the lawe ) how that the lawe hath power over a man as longe as it endureth ?
45007002	For the woman which is in subieccion to a man is bounde by the lawe to the man as longe as he liveth . Yf the man be deed she is lowsed from the lawe of the man .
45007003	So then yf whill the man liveth she couple her selfe with another man she shalbe counted a wedlocke breaker . But yf the man be deed she is fre fro the lawe : so that she is no wedlocke breaker though she couple her selfe with another man .
45007004	Even so ye my brethren are deed concerninge the lawe by the body of Christ yt ye shuld be coupled to another ( I meane to him that is rysen agayne fro deeth ) that we shuld bringe forth frute vnto God .
45007005	For when we were in the flesshe the lustes of synne which were stered vppe by ye lawe raygned in oure membres to bringe forth frute vnto deeth .
45007006	But now are we delivered fro the lawe and deed fro that whervnto we werein bondage that we shuld serve in a newe conversacion of ye sprete and not in ye olde conversacion of the letter .
45007007	What shall we saye then ? is ye lawe synne ? God forbid : but I knewe not what synne meant but by the lawe . For I had not knowne what lust had meant excepte the lawe had sayde thou shalt not lust .
45007008	But synne toke an occasion by the meanes of the commaundement and wrought in me all manner of concupiscece . For with out the lawe synne was deed .
45007009	I once lived with out lawe . But when the commaundement came synne revyved and I was deed .
45007010	And the very same comaundement which was ordeyned vnto lyfe was founde to be vnto me an occasion of deeth .
45007011	For synne toke occasion by the meanes of the comaundement and so disceaved me and by the selfe commaundement slewe we .
45007012	Wherfore the lawe is holy and the commaundement holy iust and good .
45007013	Was that then which is good made deeth vnto me ? God forbyd . Naye synne was deeth vnto me that it myght appere how that synne by the meanes of that which is good had wrought deeth in me : that synne which is vnder the commandemet myght be out of measure synfull .
45007014	For we knowe that the lawe is spirituall : but I am carnall solde vnder synne
45007015	because I wote not what I doo . For what I wold that do I not : but what I hate that do I .
45007016	Yf I do now that which I wolde not I graute to the lawe that it is good .
45007017	So then nowe it is not I that do it but synne that dwelleth in me .
45007018	For I knowe that in me ( that is to saye in my flesshe ) dwelleth no good thinge . To will is present with me : but I fynde no meanes to performe that which is good .
45007019	For I doo not yt good thinge which I wold : but that evill do I which I wolde not .
45007020	Finally yf I do that I wolde not then is it not I that doo it but synne that dwelleth in me doeth it .
45007021	I fynde then by the lawe that when I wolde do good evyll is present with me .
45007022	I delite in the lawe of God concerninge the inner man .
45007023	But I se another lawe in my membres rebellinge agaynst the lawe of my mynde and subduynge me vnto the lawe of synne which is in my membres .
45007024	O wretched man yt I am : who shall delyver me fro this body of deeth ?
45007025	I thanke God thorow Iesus Christ oure Lorde . So then I my silfe in my mynde serve the lawe of God and in my flesshe the lawe of synne .
45008001	Ther is then no damnacion to them which are in Christ Iesu which walke not after ye flesshe : but after ye sprete .
45008002	For the lawe of the sprete yt bringeth life thorowe Iesus Christ hath delivered me fro the lawe of synne and deeth .
45008003	For what the lawe coulde not doo in as moche it was weake because of the flesshe : that performed God and sent his sonne in the similitude of synfull flesshe and by synne daned synne in ye flesshe :
45008004	that the rightewesnes requyred of the lawe myght be fulfilled in vs which walke not after the flesshe but after the sprete .
45008005	For they that are carnall are carnally mynded . But they that are spirituall are gostly mynded .
45008006	To be carnally mynded is deeth . But to be spiritually mynded is lyfe and peace .
45008007	Because that the flesshly mynde is emnyte agaynst God : for it is not obedient to the lawe of God nether can be .
45008008	So then they yt are geven to the flesshe canot please God .
45008009	But ye are not geven to the flesshe but to the sprete : yf so be that ye sprite of God dwell in you . If ther be eny man yt hath not ye sprite of Christ ye same is none of his .
45008010	Yf Christ be in you the body is deed because of synne : but the sprite is lyfe for rightewesnes sake .
45008011	Wherfore if the sprite of him that raysed vppe Iesus fro deeth dwell in you : even he that raysed vp Christ from deeth shall quycken youre mortall bodyes because that this sprite dwelleth in you .
45008012	Therfore brethren we are nowe detters not to the flesshe to live after the flesshe .
45008013	For if ye live after the flesshe ye must dye . But yf ye mortifie the dedes of the body by the helpe of the sprite ye shall lyve .
45008014	For as many as are led by the sprete of God : they are the sonnes of god .
45008015	For ye have no receaved the sprete of bondage to feare eny moare but ye have receaved the sprite of adopcion wherby we crye Abba father .
45008016	The same sprete certifieth oure sprete yt we are the sonnes of God .
45008017	Yf we be sonnes we are also heyres the heyres I meane of God and heyres anexed with Christ : if so be that we suffer togedder that we maye be glorified to gedder .
45008018	For I suppose that the affliccions of this lyfe are not worthy of the glory which shalbe shewed vpon vs .
45008019	Also the fervent desyre of the creatures abideth lokynge when the sonnes of God shall appere
45008020	because the creatures are subdued to vanyte agaynst their will : but for his will which subdueth them in hope .
45008021	For ye very creatures shalbe delivered from the bondage of corrupcion into the glorious lybertie of the sonnes of God .
45008022	For we knowe that every creature groneth with vs also and travayleth in payne even vnto this tyme .
45008023	Not they only but even we also which have the fyrst frutes of the sprite morne in oureselves and wayte for the ( adopcio ) and loke for the delivraunce of oure bodyes .
45008024	For we are savyd by hope . But hope that is sene is no hope . For how can a ma hope for that which he seyth ?
45008025	But and yf we hope for that we se not then do we with pacience abyde for it .
45008026	Lyke wyse ye sprite also helpeth oure infirmities . For we knowe not what to desyre as we ought : but the sprete maketh intercession mightely for vs with gronynges which canot be expressid with tonge .
45008027	And he that searcheth the hertes knoweth what is ye meaninge of the sprite : for he maketh intercession for the sayntes accordinge to ye pleasure of god .
45008028	For we knowe that all thinges worke for the best vnto them yt love God which also are called of purpose .
45008029	For those which he knewe before he also ordeyned before yt they shuld be lyke fassioned vnto the shape of his sonne that he myght be ye fyrst begotten sonne amoge many brethren .
45008030	Morover which he apoynted before them he also called . And which he called them also he iustified which he iustified them he also glorified .
45008031	What shall we then saye vnto these thinges ? yf god be on oure syde : who can be agaynst vs ?
45008032	which spared not his awne sonne but gave him for vs all : how shall he not wt him geve vs all thinges also ?
45008033	Who shall laye eny thinge to ye charge of goddes chosen ? it is god that iustifieth :
45008034	who then shall condempne ? it is Christ which is deed ye rather which is rysen agayne which is also on the ryght honde of God and maketh intercession for vs .
45008035	Who shall seperate vs fro the love of god ? shall tribulacion ? or anguysshe ? or persecucion ? other honger ? other nakednesse ? other parell ? other swearde ?
45008036	As it is written : For thy sake are we kylled all daye longe and are counted as shepe apoynted to be slayne .
45008037	Neverthelesse in all these thinges we overcome strongly thorow his helpe that loved vs .
45008038	Ye and I am sure that nether deeth nether lyfe nether angels nor rule nether power nether thinges present nether thinges to come
45008039	nether heyth nether loweth nether eny other creature shalbe able to departe vs fro ye love of God shewed in Christ Iesu oure lorde .
45009001	I saye the trueth in Christ and lye not in that wherof my conscience beareth me witnes in the holy gost
45009002	that I have gret hevynes and continuall sorowe in my hert .
45009003	For I have wysshed my selfe to be cursed from Christ for my brethren and my kynsmen as pertayninge to the flesshe
45009004	which are the Israelites . To whom pertayneth the adopcion and the glorie and the covenauntes and the law that was geven and the service of God and the promyses :
45009005	whose also are the fathers and they of whome ( as concernynge the flesshe ) Christ came which is God over all thinges blessed for ever Amen .
45009006	I speake not these thinges as though the wordes of god had take none effecte . For they are not all Israelites which came of Israel :
45009007	nether are they all chyldren strayght waye because they are the seed of Abraham . But in Isaac shall thy seede be called :
45009008	that is to saye they which are the chyldren of the flesshe are not the chyldren of god . But the chyldren of promes are counted the seede .
45009009	For this is a worde of promes aboute this tyme will I come and Sara shall have a sonne .
45009010	Nether was it so wt her only : but also when Rebecca was with chylde by one I meane by oure father Isaac
45009011	yeer the chyldren were borne when they had nether done good nether bad : that the purpose of God which is by election myght stonde
45009012	it was sayde vnto her not by the reason of workes but by grace of ye caller : the elder shall serve the yonger .
45009013	As it is written : Iacob he loved but Esau he hated .
45009014	What shall we saye then ? is there eny vnrightewesses with God ? God forbyd .
45009015	For he sayth to Moses : I will shewe mercye to who I shewe mercy : and will have compassion on whom I have copassion .
45009016	So lieth it not then in a mans will or cunnynge but in ye mercye of god .
45009017	For the scripture sayth vnto Pharao : Even for this same purpose have I stered ye vp to shewe my power on ye and that my name myght be declared thorow out all the worlde .
45009018	So hath he mercye on whom he will and whom he will he maketh hearde herted .
45009019	Thou wilt saye then vnto me : why then blameth he vs yet ? For who can resist his will ?
45009020	But o man what arte thou which disputest with God ? Shall the worke saye to the workeman : why hast thou made me on this fassion ?
45009021	Hath not the potter power over the claye even of the same lompe to make one vessell vnto honoure and a nother vnto dishonoure ?
45009022	Even so God willynge to shewe his wrath and to make his power knowen suffered with longe pacience the vessels of wrath ordeyned to damnacion
45009023	that he myght declare ye ryches of his glory on the vessels of mercye which he had prepayred vnto glorie :
45009024	that is to saye vs which he called not of the Iewes only but also of ye gentyls .
45009025	As he sayth in Osee : I will call them my people which were not my people : and her beloved which was not beloved .
45009026	And it shall come to passe in the place where it was sayd vnto them ye are not my people : that there shalbe called the chyldren of the lyvynge God .
45009027	But Esaias cryeth concernynge Israel though the nomber of the chyldren of Israel be as the sonde of the see yet shall a remnaut be saved .
45009028	He finyssheth the worde verely and maketh it short in ryghtwesses . For a short worde will god make on erth .
45009029	And as Esaias sayd before : Except the Lorde of sabaoth had left us seede we had bene made as Zodoma and had bene lykened to Gomorra .
45009030	What shall we saye then ? We saye that the gentyls which followed not rightewesnes have overtaken rightewesnes : I meane the rightewesnes which cometh of fayth .
45009031	But Israel which folowed the lawe of rightewesnes coulde not attayne vnto ye lawe of rightewesnes .
45009032	And wherfore ? Because they sought it not by fath : but as it were by the workes of the lawe . For they have stombled at the stomblynge stone .
45009033	As it is written : Beholde I put in Syon a stomblynge stone and a rocke which shall make men faule . And none yt beleve on him shalbe a shamed .
45010001	Brethren my hertes desyre and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved .
45010002	For I beare them recorde that they have a fervet mynde to God warde but not accordinge to knowledge .
45010003	For they are ignoraut of the rightewesnes which is alowed before God and goo about to stablisshe their awne rightewesnes and therfore are not obedient vnto the rightewesnes which is of valew before God .
45010004	For Christ is the ende of the lawe to iustifie all that beleve .
45010005	Moses describeth the rightewesnes which cometh of ye lawe howe that the man which doth the thinges of the lawe shall lyve therin .
45010006	But ye rightewesnes which cometh of fayth speaketh on this wyse . Saye not in thyne hert who shall ascende into heven ? ( that is nothinge els then to fetch Christ doune )
45010007	Other who shall descende into the depe ? ( that is nothinge els but to fetch vp Christ from deeth )
45010008	But what sayth the scripture ? The worde is nye the even in thy mouth and in thyn herte . This worde is the worde of fayth which we preache .
45010009	For yf thou shalt knowledge wt thy mouth that Iesus is the lorde and shalt beleve with thyn hert that God raysed him up from deeth thou shalt be safe .
45010010	For the belefe of the hert iustifieth : and to knowledge with the mouth maketh a man safe .
45010011	For the scripture sayth : whosoever beleveth on him shall not be ashamed .
45010012	Ther is no difference bitwene the Iewe and the gentyll . For one is Lorde of all which is ryche vnto all that call on him .
45010013	For whosoever shall call on the name of the lorde shalbe safe .
45010014	But how shall they call on him on who they beleved not ? how shall they beleve on him of whom they have not herde ? how shall they heare with out a preacher ?
45010015	And how shall they preach except they be sent ? As it is written : how beautifull are the fete of them which bringe glad tydynges of peace and bringe glad tydynges of good thinges .
45010016	But they have not all obeyed to ye gospell . For Esaias sayth : Lorde who shall beleve oure sayinges ?
45010017	So then fayth cometh by hearynge and hearynge cometh by the worde of God .
45010018	But I axe : have they not herde ? No dout their sounde went out into all londes : and their wordes in to the endes of the worlde .
45010019	But I demaunde whether Israel dyd knowe or not ? Fyrst Moses sayth : I will provoke you for to envy by the that are no people and by a folisshe nacion I will anger you .
45010020	Esaias after that is bolde and sayth . I am founde of the that sought me not and have appered to them that axed not after me .
45010021	And agaynst Israel he sayth : All daye longe have I stretched forth my hondes vnto a people yt beleveth not but speaketh agaynst me .
45011001	I saye then : hath god cast awaye his people ? God forbyd . For even I verely am an Israelite of the seed of Abraha and of ye tribe of Beniamin
45011002	god hath not cast awaye his people which he knew before . Ether wote ye not what the scripture sayth by the mouth of Helias how he maketh intercession to god agaynst Israel sayinge :
45011003	Lorde they have kylled thy prophetes and dygged doune thyn alters : and I am lefte only and they seke my lyfe .
45011004	But what sayth the answer of god to him agayne ? I have reserved vnto me seven thousande men which have not bowed the knee to Baal .
45011005	Even so at this tyme ys ther a remnanaunt lefte thorow the eleccion of grace .
45011006	Yf it be of grace the is it not of workes . For then were grace no moare grace . Yf it be of workes then is it no moare grace . For then were deservyng no lenger deservynge .
45011007	What then ? Israel hath not obtayned that that he sought . No but yet the election hath obtayned it . The remnaunt are blynded
45011008	accordynge as it is written : God hath geven the the sprete of vnquyetnes : eyes that they shuld not se and eares that they shuld not heare even vnto this daye .
45011009	And David sayth : Let their table be made a snare to take them with all and an occasion to faule and a rewarde vnto them .
45011010	Let their eyes be blynded that they se not : and ever bowe doune their backes .
45011011	I saye then : Have they therfore stombled that they shulde but faule only ? God forbyd : but thorowe their faule is salvacio happened vnto the gentyls for to provoke the with all .
45011012	Wherfore yf the faule of them be the ryches of the worlde : and the mynysshynge of them the ryches of the gentyls : How moche more shuld it be so yf they all beleved .
45011013	I speake to you gentyls in as moche as I am the Apostle of ye gentyls I will magnify myn office
45011014	that I myght provoke them which are my flesshe and myght save some of them .
45011015	For yf the castynge awaye of them be the reconcylynge of the worlde : what shall the receavynge of them be but lyfe agayne from deeth ?
45011016	For yf one pece be holy the whole heepe is holy . And yf the rote be holy the braunches are holy also .
45011017	Though some of the brauuches be broken of and thou beynge a wylde olyue tree arte graft in amonge them and made parttaker of ye rote and fatnes of the olyve tree
45011018	bost not thy selfe agaynst the brauches . For yf thou bost thy selfe remember that thou bearest not the rote but the rote the .
45011019	Thou wilt saye then : the brauches are broken of that I myght be grafte in .
45011020	Thou sayest well : because of vnbeleve they are broken of and thou stondest stedfast in fayth .
45011021	Be not hye mynded but feare seynge that God spared not the naturall braunches lest haply he also spare not the .
45011022	Beholde ye kyndnes and rigorousnes of God : on the which fell rigorousnes : but towardes the kyndnes yf thou cotinue in his kyndnes . Or els thou shalt be hewen of
45011023	and they yf they byde not still in vnbelefe shalbe graffed in agayne . For God is of power to graffe them in agayne .
45011024	For yf thou wast cut out of a naturall wilde olyve tree and wast graffed contrary to nature in a true olyve tree : how moche more shall the naturall brauches be graffed in their awne olyve tree agayne .
45011025	I wolde not that this secrete shuld be hyd fro you my brethren ( lest ye shuld be wyse in youre awne consaytes ) that partly blyndnes is happened in Israel vntyll ye fulnes of the gentyls be come in :
45011026	and so all Israel shalbe saved . As it is writte : There shall come oute of Sion he yt doth delyver and shall turne awaye the vngodlynes of Iacob .
45011027	And this is my covenaunt vnto them when I shall take awaye their synnes .
45011028	As cocernynge the gospell they are enemies for youre sakes : but as touchinge the election they are loved for ye fathers sakes .
45011029	For verely the gyftes and callynge of god are soche that it cannot repent him of them :
45011030	for loke as ye in tyme passed have not beleved God yet have now obtayned mercy thorow their vnbelefe :
45011031	even so now have they not beleved the mercy which is happened vnto you that they also maye obtayne mercy .
45011032	God hath wrapped all nacions in vnbeleve that he myght have mercie on all .
45011033	O the depnes of the aboundaunt wysdome and knowledge of God : how vnserchable are his iudgementes and his wayes past findyng out .
45011034	For who hath knowen the mynde of the lorde ? or who was his counseller ?
45011035	other who hath geven vnto him fyrst that he myght be recompensed agayne ?
45011036	For of him and thorow him and for him are all thinges To him be glorye for ever Amen .
45012001	I beseche you therfore brethre by ye mercyfulnes of God that ye make youre bodyes aquicke sacrifise holy and acceptable vnto God which is youre resonable seruynge of god .
45012002	And fassion not youre selves lyke vnto this worlde : But be ye chaunged in youre shape by the renuynge of youre wittes that ye maye fele what thynge that good yt acceptable and perfaycte will of god is .
45012003	For I saye ( thorowe the grace that vnto me geve is ) to every man amonge you that noman esteme of him selfe moare then it becometh him to esteme : but that he discretely iudge of him selfe accordynge as God hath dealte to every man the measure of fayth .
45012004	As we have many members in one body and all members have not one office :
45012005	so we beynge many are one body in Christ and every man ( amoge oure selves ) one anothers mebers Seynge
45012006	that we have dyvers gyftes accordynge to the grace that is geven vnto vs : yf eny man have ye gyft of prophesye let him have it that it be agreynge vnto the fayth .
45012007	Let him that hath an office wayte on his office . Let him that teacheth take hede to his doctrine .
45012008	Let him that exhorteth geve attendaunce to his exhortacion . Yf eny man geve let him do it with singlenes . Let him that ruleth do it with diligence . Yf eny man shewe mercy let him do it with cherfulnes .
45012009	Let love be wt out dissimulacion . Hate that which is evyll and cleave vnto that which is good .
45012010	Be kynde one to another with brotherly love . In gevynge honoure goo one before another .
45012011	Let not yt busynes which ye have in honde be tedious to you . Be fervet in ye sprete . Applye youre selves to ye tyme .
45012012	Reioyce in hope . Be paciet in tribulacion . Continue in prayer .
45012013	Distribute vnto the necessite of the saynctes and diligently to harboure .
45012014	Blesse the which persecute you : blesse but course not .
45012015	Be mery with the that are mery . Wepe wt them that wepe .
45012016	Be of lyke affeccion one towardes another . Be not hye mided : but make youreselves equall to the of ye lower sorte . Be not wyse in youre awne opinios .
45012017	Recopence to no ma evyll fore evyll . Provyde afore honde thinges honest in ye syght of all men .
45012018	Yf it be possible howbe it of youre parte have peace with all men .
45012019	Derly beloued avenge not youre selves but geve roume vnto the wrath of God . For it is written : vengeaunce is myne and I will rewarde saith the lorde .
45012020	Terfore yf thyn enemy honger fede him : yf he thurst geve him drinke . For in so doynge thou shalt heape coles of fyre on his heed :
45012021	Be not overcome of evyll : But overcome evyll wt goodnes .
45013001	Let every soule submit him selfe vnto the auctorite of ye hyer powers . For there is no power but of God .
45013002	The powers that be are ordeyned of God . Whosoever therfore resysteth power resisteth the ordinaunce of God . And they that resist shall receave to the selfe damnacio .
45013003	For rulars are not to be feared for good workes but for evyll Wilt thou be with out feare of the power ? Do well then : and so shalt thou be praysed of the same .
45013004	For he is the minister of God for thy welth . But and yf thou do evyll then feare : for he beareth not a swearde for nought : but is the minister of God to take vengeaunce on them that do evyll .
45013005	Wherfore ye must nedes obeye not for feare of vengeaunce only : but also because of conscience .
45013006	And even for this cause paye ye tribute . For they are goddes ministers servynge for the same purpose .
45013007	Geve to every man therfore his duetie : Tribute to whom tribute belongeth : Custome to whom custome is due : feare to whom feare belongeth : Honoure to who honoure pertayneth
45013008	Owe nothinge to eny man : but to love one another . For he that loveth another fulfylleth the lawe .
45013009	For these commaundementes : Thou shalt not comit advoutry : Thou shalt not kyll : Thou shalt not steale : Thou shalt not beare false witnes : Thou shalt not desyre and so forth ( yf there be eny other comaundement ) they are all comprehended in this sayinge : Love thyne neghbour as thy selfe .
45013010	Love hurteth not his neghbour . Therfore is love the fulfillynge of the lawe .
45013011	This also we knowe I mean the season howe that it is tyme that we shuld now awake oute of slepe . For now is oure salvacion nearer then when we beleved .
45013012	The nyght is passed and the daye is come nye . Let us therfore cast awaye the dedes of darcknes and let vs put on the ( Armoure ) of lyght .
45013013	Let vs walke honestly as it were in the daye lyght : not in eatynge and drinkynge : nether in chamburynge and wantannes : nether in stryfe and envyinge :
45013014	but put ye on the Lorde Iesus Christ . And make not provision for the flesshe to fulfyll ye lustes of it .
45014001	Him that is weake in the fayth receave vnto you not in disputynge and troublynge his conscience .
45014002	One beleveth that he maye eate all thinge . Another which is weake eateth earbes .
45014003	Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not . And let not him whiche eateth not iudge him that eateth . For God hath receaved him .
45014004	What arte thou that iudgest another manes servaut ? Whether he stonde or faule that pertayneth vnto his master : ye he shall stonde . For God is able to make him stonde .
45014005	This man putteth difference bitwene daye and daye . Another man counteth all dayes alyke . Se that no man waver in his awne meanynge .
45014006	He that observeth one daye more then another doth it for ye lordes pleasure . And he that observeth not one daye moare then another doeth it to please ye lorde also . He that eateth doth it to please the lorde for he geveth god thankes .
45014007	And he yt eateth not eateth not to please ye lorde wt all and geveth god thankes .
45014008	For none of vs lyveth his awne servaut : nether doeth anye of vs dye his awne servaunt . Yf we lyve we lyve to be at ye lordes will . And yf we dye we dye at ye lordes will . Whether we lyve therfore or dye we are the lordes .
45014009	For Christ therfore dyed and rose agayne and revived that he myght be lorde both of deed and quicke .
45014010	But why doest thou then iudge thy brother ? Other why doest thou despyse thy brother ? We shall all be brought before the iudgement seate of Christ .
45014011	For it is written : as truely as I lyve sayth ye lorde all knees shall bowe to me and all tonges shall geve a knowledge to God .
45014012	So shall every one of vs geve accomptes of him selfe to God .
45014013	Let vs not therfore iudge one another eny more . But iudge this rather that no man put a stomblynge blocke or an occasion to faule in his brothers waye .
45014014	For I knowe and am full certified in the Lorde Iesus that ther is nothinge comen of it selfe : but vnto him that iudgeth it to be comen : to him is it comen .
45014015	If thy brother be greved with thy meate now walkest thou not charitablye . Destroye not him with thy meate for whom Christ dyed .
45014016	Cause not youre treasure to be evyll spoken of .
45014017	For the kyngdome of God is not meate and drinke : but rightewesnes peace and ioye in the holy goost .
45014018	For whosoever in these thinges serveth Christ pleaseth well God and is commended of men .
45014019	Let vs folowe tho thinges which make for peace and thinges wherwith one maye edyfie another .
45014020	Destroye not ye worke of god for a lytell meates sake . All thinges are pure : but it is evyll for that man which eateth with hurte of his conscience .
45014021	It is good nether to eate flesshe nether to drincke wyne nether eny thinge wherby thy brother stombleth ether falleth or is made weake .
45014022	Hast thou fayth ? have it with thy selfe before god . Happy is he yt condempneth not him selfe in that thinge which he aloweth .
45014023	For he yt maketh conscience is dampned yf he eate : because he doth it not of fayth . For whatsoever is not of fayth that same is synne .
45015001	We which are stronge ought to beare the fraylnes of them which are weake and not to stonde in oure awne cosaytes .
45015002	Let every man please his neghbour vnto his welth and edyfyinge .
45015003	For Christ pleased not him selfe : but as it is written . The rebukes of the which rebuked the fell one me .
45015004	Whatsoever thinges are written afore tyme are written for oure learnynge that we thorow pacience and comforte of the scripture myght have hope .
45015005	The God of pacience and consolacion geve vnto every one of you that ye be lyke mynded one towardes another after the insample of Christ :
45015006	that ye all agreynge together maye with one mouth prayse God the father of oure Lorde Iesus .
45015007	Wherfore receave ye one another as Christ receaved vs to the prayse of God .
45015008	And I saye that Iesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the trueth of god to conferme the promyses made vnto the fathers .
45015009	And let the gentyls prayse god for his mercy as it is written : For this cause I will prayse the amonge the gentyls and synge in thy name .
45015010	And agayne he sayth : reioyse ye gentyles with his people .
45015011	And agayne prayse the Lorde all ye gentyls and laude him all nacions .
45015012	And in another place Esaias sayth : ther shalbe the rote of Iesse and he that shall ryse ro raygne over the gentyls : in him shall the gentyls trust .
45015013	The God of hope fyll you with all ioye and peace in belevynge : that ye maye be ryche in hope thorowe the power of the holy goost .
45015014	I my selfe am full certified of you my brethren that ye youre selves are full of goodnes and filled with all knowledge and are able to exhorte one another .
45015015	Neverthelesse brethren I have some what boldly written vnto you as one that putteth you in remembrauce thorow the grace that is geven me of God
45015016	that I shuld be the minister of Iesu Christ amonge the gentyls and shuld minister the gladde tydynges of God that the gentyls myght be an acceptable offerynge sanctyfied by the holy goost .
45015017	I have therfore wherof I maye reioyse in Christ Iesu in tho thinges which pertayne to God .
45015018	For I dare not speake of eny of tho thinges which Christ hath not wrought by me to make the gentyls obedient with worde and dede
45015019	in myghty signes and wonders by the power of the sprete of God : so that from Ierusalem and the costes rounde aboute vnto Illyricum I have fylled all countres with the gladde tydynges of Christ .
45015020	So have I enforsed my selfe to preache the gospell not where Christ was named lest I shuld have bylt on another mannes foundacion :
45015021	but as it is written : To whom he was not spoken of they shall se : and they that hearde not shall vnderstonde .
45015022	For this cause I have bene ofte let to come vnto you :
45015023	but now seynge I have no moare to do in these countres and also have bene desyrous many yeares to come vnto you
45015024	when I shall take my iorney into spayne I will come to you . I trust to se you in my iorney and to be brought on my waye thither warde by you after that I have somwhat enioyed you .
45015025	Now go I vnto Ierusalem and minister vnto the saynctes .
45015026	For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certayne distribucio vpo the poore saynctes which are at Ierusalem .
45015027	It hath pleased them verely and their detters are they . For yf the getils be made partetakers of their spirituall thinges their dutie is to minister vnto the in carnall thinges .
45015028	When I have performed this and have brought them this frute sealed . I will come backe agayne by you into Spayne .
45015029	And I am sure when I come that I shall come with aboundaunce of the blessinge of the gospell of Christ .
45015030	I beseche you brethre for oure Lorde Iesus Christes sake and for the love of the sprete that ye helpe me in my busynes with youre prayers to God for me
45015031	that I maye be delyvered from them which beleve not in Iewry and that this my service which I have to Ierusalem maye be accepted of ye saynctes
45015032	that I maye come vnto you with ioye by the will of God and maye with you be refresshed .
45015033	The God of peace be with you . Amen .
45016001	I commede vnto you Phebe oure sister ( which is a minister of the congregacion of Chenchrea )
45016002	that ye receave her in the Lorde as it becommeth saynctes and that ye assist her in whatsoever busynes she neadeth of youre ayde . For she hath suckered many and myne awne selfe also .
45016003	Grete Prisca and Aquila my helpers in Christ Iesu
45016004	which have for my lyfe layde doune their awne neckes . Vnto which not I only geve thankes but also the congregacion of the getyls .
45016005	Lyke wyse grete all the copany that is in thy housse . Salute my welbeloved Epenetos which is the fyrst frute amoge them of Achaia .
45016006	Grete Mary which bestowed moche labour on vs .
45016007	Salute Andronicus and Iunia my cosyns which were presoners with me also which are wele taken amoge the Apostles and were in Christ before me .
45016008	Grete Amplias my beloved in ye Lorde .
45016009	Salute Vrban oure helper in Christ and Stachys my beloved .
45016010	Salute Appelles approved in Christ . Salute them which are of Aristobolus housholde .
45016011	Salute Herodion my kynsma . Grete them of the housholde of Narcissus which are in the Lorde .
45016012	Salute Triphena and Triphosa which wemen dyd labour in ye Lorde . Salute ye beloved Persis which laboured in the Lorde .
45016013	Salute Rufus chosen tn the Lorde and his mother and myne .
45016014	Grete Asincritus Phlegon Herman Patrobas Hermen and the brethren which are wt them .
45016015	Salute Philologus and Iulia Nereus and his sister and Olimpha and all the saynctes which are with them .
45016016	Salute one another with an holy kysse . The congregacions of Christ salute you .
45016017	I beseche you brethre marke them which cause division and geve occasions of evyll contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned : and avoyde them .
45016018	For they yt are suche serve not ye Lorde Iesus Christ : but their awne bellyes and with swete preachinges and flatteringe wordes deceave the hertes of the innocetes .
45016019	For youre obedience extendeth to all men . I am glad no dout of you . But yet I wolde have you wyse vnto yt which is good and to be innocetes concerninge evyll .
45016020	The God of peace treade Satan vnder youre fete shortly . The grace of oure Lorde Iesu Christ be with you .
45016021	Thimotheus my worke felow and Lucius and Iason and Sopater my kynsmen salute you .
45016022	I Tertius salute you which wrote this epistle in the Lorde .
45016023	Gaius myne hoste and the hoste of all the congregacions saluteth you . Erastus the chamberlayne of ye cite saluteth you . And Quartus a brother saluteth you .
45016024	The grace of oure Lorde Iesu Christ be wt you all . Ame
45016025	To him that is of power to stablisshe you accordinge to my gospell and preachinge of Iesus Christ in vtteringe of the mistery which was kept secret sence the worlde begane
45016026	but now is opened by ye scriptures of prophesie at the commaundement of the everlastinge god to stere vp obedience to the faith publisshed amonge all nacions :
45016027	To the same God which alone is wyse be prayse thorowe Iesus Christ for ever . Amen .
46001001	Paul by vocacion an Apostle of Iesus Christ thorow the will of God and brother Sostenes .
46001002	Vnto the congregacion of God which is at Corinthum . To them that are sanctified in Christ Iesu sainctes by callynge with all that call on the name of oure lorde Iesus Christ in every place both of theirs and of oures
46001003	Grace be with you and peace fro God oure father and from the lorde Iesus Christ .
46001004	I thanke my God all wayes on youre behalfe for ye grace of God which is geuen you by Iesus Christ
46001005	that in all thinges ve are made riche by him in all lerninge and in all knowledge
46001006	even as the testimony of Iesus Christ was confermed in you )
46001007	so that ye are behynde in no gyft and wayte for the apperynge of oure lorde Iesus Christ
46001008	which shall streght you vnto ye ende that ye maye be blamelesse in ye daye of oure lorde Iesus Christ .
46001009	ffor god is faythfull by whom ye are called vnto ye fellishyppe of his sonne Iesus Christe oure lorde
46001010	I beseche you brethre in ye name of oure lorde Iesus Christ that ye all speake one thynge and that there be no dissencion amoge you : but be ye knyt together in one mynde and in one meaynge .
46001011	It is shewed vnto me ( my brethren ) of you by them that are of the housse of Cloe that ther is stryfe amonge you . And this is it that I meane :
46001012	how that comelie amonge you one sayeth : I holde of Paul : another I holde of Apollo : ye thyrde I holde of Cephas : ye four ye I holde of Christ .
46001013	Ys Christ devided ? was Paul crucified for you ? ether were ye baptised in ye name of Paul ?
46001014	I thanke God that I christened none of you but Crispus and Gayus
46001015	lest eny shulde saye that I had baptised in myne awne name .
46001016	I baptised also the housse of Stephana . Forthermore knowe I not whether I baptised eny man or no .
46001017	For Christ sent me not to baptyse but to preache ye gospell not with wysdome of wordes lest the crosse of Christ shuld have bene made of none effecte .
46001018	For ye preachinge of the crosse is to them yt perisshe folishnes : but vnto vs which are saved it is ye power of God .
46001019	For it is written : I will destroye the wysdome of the wyse and will cast awaye the vnderstondinge of the prudet .
46001020	Where is the wyse ? Where is the scrybe ? Where is the searcher of this worlde ?
46001021	Hath not God made the wysdome of this worlde folisshnes ? For when the worlde thorow wysdome knew not God in ye wysdome of God : it pleased God thorow folisshnes of preachinge to save them yt beleve .
46001022	For ye Iewes requyre a signe and the Grekes seke after wysdome .
46001023	But we preache Christ crucified vnto the Iewes an occasion of fallinge and vnto the Grekes folisshnes :
46001024	but vnto the which are called both of Iewes and Grekes we preache Christ ye power of God and the wysdome of God .
46001025	For the folishnes of God is wyser then me : and the weakenes of God is stronger then men .
46001026	Brethren loke on youre callinge how that not many wyse men after the flesshe not many myghty not many of hye degre are called :
46001027	but God hath chosen the folysshe thinges of the worlde to confounde the wyse . And God hath chosyn the weake thinges of the worlde to confounde thinges which are mighty .
46001028	And vile thinges of the worlde and thinges which are despysed hath God chosen yee and thinges of no reputacion for to brynge to nought thinges of reputacion
46001029	that no flesshe shulde reioyce in his presence .
46001030	And vnto him partayne ye in Christ Iesu which of God is made vnto vs wysdome and also rightewesnes and saunctifyinge and redempcion .
46001031	That accordinge as it is written : he which reioyseth shulde reioyce in the Lorde .
46002001	And I brethren when I came to you came not in gloriousnes of wordes or of wysdome shewynge vnto you the testimony of God .
46002002	Nether shewed I my selfe that I knewe eny thinge amonge you save Iesus Christ eve the same that was crucified .
46002003	And I was amoge you in weaknes and in feare and in moche treblinge .
46002004	And my wordes and my preachinge were not with entysynge wordes of manes wysdome : but in shewinge of ye sprete and of power
46002005	that youre fayth shuld not stonde in ye wysdome of me but in yt power of God .
46002006	That we speake of is wysdome amonge them that are perfecte : not the wysdome of this worlde nether of the rulars of this worlde ( which go to nought )
46002007	but we speake ye wysdome of God which is in secrete and lieth hyd which God ordeyned before the worlde vnto oure glory :
46002008	which wysdome none of ye rulars of the worlde knewe . For had they knowe it they wolde not have crucified the Lorde of glory .
46002009	But as it is written : The eye hath not sene and the eare hath not hearde nether have entred into the herte of man ye thinges which God hath prepared for them that love him .
46002010	But God hath opened them vnto vs by his sprete . For ye sprete searcheth all thinges ye the bottome of Goddes secretes .
46002011	For what man knoweth the thinges of a ma : save ye sprete of a man which is with in him ? Even so ye thinges of God knoweth no man but ye sprete of god .
46002012	And we have not receaved the sprete of ye worlde : but the sprete which cometh of god for to knowe the thinges that are geve to vs of god
46002013	which thinges also we speake not in the conynge wordes of manes wysdome but with the conynge wordes of the holy goost makynge spretuall coparesons of spretuall thinges .
46002014	For ye naturall man perceaveth not the thinges of the sprete of god . For they are but folysshnes vnto him . Nether can he perceave them because he is spretually examined .
46002015	But he that is spretuall discusseth all thinges : yet he him selfe is iudged of no ma .
46002016	For who knoweth the mynde of the Lorde other who shall informe him ? But we vnderstonde the mynde of Christ .
46003001	And I coulde not speake vnto you brethre as vnto spretuall : but as vnto carnall even as it were vnto babes in Christ .
46003002	I gave you mylke to drinke and not meate . For ye then were not stronge no nether yet are .
46003003	For ye are yet carnall . As longe verely as ther is amoge you envyige stryfe and dissencio : are ye not carnall and walke after ye manner of me ?
46003004	As loge as one sayth I holde of Paul and another I am of Apollo are ye not carnall ?
46003005	What is Paul ? What thinge is Apollo ? Only miministers are they by who ye beleved even as the Lorde gave every ma grace .
46003006	I have planted : Apollo watred : but god gave increace .
46003007	So then nether is he that planteth eny thinge nether he yt watreth : but god which gave the increace .
46003008	He that planteth and he that watreth are nether better then the other . Every man yet shall receave his rewarde accordynge to his laboure .
46003009	We are goddis labourers ye are goddis husbandrye ye are goddis byldynge .
46003010	Accordynge to the grace of god geven vnto me as a wyse bylder have I layde the foundacio And another bylt thero But let every ma take hede how he bildeth apo .
46003011	For other foundacion can no man laye then yt which is layde which is Iesus Christ .
46003012	Yf eny man bilde on this foundacion golde silver precious stones tymber haye or stoble :
46003013	every mannes worke shall appere . For the daye shall declare it and it shalbe shewed in fyre . And ye fyre shall trye euery mannes worke what it is .
46003014	Yf eny mannes worke yt he hath bylt apon byde he shall receave a rewarde .
46003015	If eny manes worke burne he shall suffre losse : but he shalbe safe him selfe : neverthelesse yet as it were thorow fyre .
46003016	Are ye not ware that ye are the temple of god and how that the sprete of god dwelleth in you ?
46003017	Yf eny man defyle the temple of god him shall god destroye . For the temple of god is holy which temple ye are .
46003018	Let no man deceave him silfe . Yf eny man seme wyse amonge you let him be a fole in this worlde that he maye be wyse .
46003019	For ye wisdome of this worlde is folysshnes with god . For it is writte : he compaseth the wyse in their craftynes .
46003020	And agayne God knoweth the thoughtes of the wyse that they be vayne .
46003021	Therfore let no ma reioyce in men . For all thinges are youres
46003022	whether it be Paul other Apollo other Cephas : whether it be ye worlde other lyfe other deeth whether they be present thinges or thinges to come : all are youres
46003023	and ye are Christes and Christ is goddis .
46004001	Let men this wyse esteme vs eve as the ministers of Christ and disposers of ye secretes of God .
46004002	Furthermore it is requyred of the disposers that they be founde faithfull .
46004003	With me is it but a very smal thinge that I shuld be iudged of you ether of ( mans daye ) No I iudge not myn awne selfe .
46004004	I know nought by my selfe : yet am I not therby iustified . It is the Lorde that iudgeth me .
46004005	Therfore iudge no thinge before the tyme vntill the Lorde come which will lighten thinges that are hyd in darcknes and ope the counsels of the hertes . And then shall every man have prayse of God .
46004006	These thinges brethre I have described in myn awne person and Apollos for youre sakes that ye myght learne by vs that no man coute of him selfe beyonde that which is above written : that one swell not agaynst another for eny mans cause .
46004007	For who preferreth the ? What hast thou that thou hast not receaved ? Yf thou have receaved it why reioysest thou as though thou haddest not receaved it ?
46004008	Now ye are full : now ye are made rych : ye raygne as kinges with out vs : and I wold to god ye dyd raygne that we might raygne with you .
46004009	Me thinketh that God hath set forth vs which are Apostles for the lowest of all as it were me appoynted to deeth . For we are a gasyngestocke vnto the worlde and to ye angels and to men .
46004010	We are foles for Christes sake and ye are wyse thorow Christ . We are weake and ye are stroge . Ye are honorable and we are despised .
46004011	Eve vnto this daye we honger and thyrst and are naked and are boffetted wt fistes and have no certayne dwellinge place
46004012	and laboure workinge with oure awne hondes . We are revysed and yet we blesse . We are persecuted and suffer it .
46004013	We are evyll spoken of and we praye . We are made as it were the filthynes of the worlde the ofscowringe of all thinges even vnto this tyme .
46004014	I write not these thinges to shame you : but as my beloved sonnes I warne you .
46004015	For though ye have ten thousande instructours in Christ : yet have ye not many fathers . In Christ Iesu I have begotten you thorowe ye gospell .
46004016	Wherfore I desyre you to folowe me .
46004017	For this cause have I sent vnto you Timotheus which is my deare sonne and faithfull in the Lorde which shall put you in remembrauce of my wayes which I have in Christ eve as I teache every where in all congregacios .
46004018	Some swell as though I wolde come no more at you .
46004019	But I will come to you shortely yf God will : and will knowe not ye wordes of the which swell but ye power :
46004020	for ye kyngdome of God is not in wordes but in power .
46004021	What will ye ? Shall I come vnto you with a rodde or els in love and in the sprete of mekenes ?
46005001	There goeth a comen sayinge that ther is fornicacion amoge you and soche fornicacion as is not once named amonge the gentyls : that one shuld have his fathers wyfe .
46005002	And ye swell and have not rather sorowed yt he which hath done this dede myght be put fro amoge you .
46005003	For I verely as absent in body even so present in sprete have determyned all redy ( as though I were present ) of him that hath done this dede
46005004	in the name of oure Lorde Iesu Christ when ye are gaddered togedder and my sprete with the power of the Lorde Iesus Christ
46005005	to deliver him vnto Satan for ye destruccio of the flesshe yt the sprete maye be saved in ye daye of ye Lorde Iesus .
46005006	Youre reioysinge is not good : knowe ye not that a lytle leve sowreth the whole lompe of dowe .
46005007	Pourge therfore the olde leven that ye maye be newe dowe as ye are swete breed . For Christ oure esterlambe is offered vp for vs .
46005008	Therfore let vs kepe holy daye not with olde leve nether with the leven of maliciousnes and wickednes : but with the swete breed of purenes and truth .
46005009	I wrote vnto you in a pistle that ye shuld not company with fornicatours .
46005010	And I meat not at all of the fornicatours of this worlde ether of the coveteous or of extorsioners ether of the ydolaters : for then must ye nedes have gone out of ye worlde .
46005011	But now I write vnto you that ye company not togedder yf eny that is called a brother be a fornicator or coveteous or a worshipper of ymages ether a raylar ether a dronkard or an extorcionar : with him that is soche se that ye eate not .
46005012	For what have I to do to iudge them which are with out ? Do ye not iudge them that are with in ?
46005013	Them that are with out God shall iudge . Put awaye from amonge you that evyll parson .
46006001	How dare one of you havinge busines with another goo to lawe vnder the wicked and not rather vnder the sainctes ?
46006002	Do ye not know that the sainctes shall iudge the worlde ? If the worlde shalbe iudged by you : are ye not good ynough to iudge smale trifles :
46006003	knowe ye not how that we shall iudge the angles ? How moche more maye we iudge thinges that partayne to ye lyfe ?
46006004	If ye have iudgementes of worldely matters take them which are despised in ye congregacio and make them iudges .
46006005	This I saye to youre shame . Is ther vtterly no wyse man amoge you ? What not one at all yt can iudge bitwene brother and brother
46006006	but one brother goeth to lawe with another : and that vnder the vnbelevers ?
46006007	Now therfore ther is vtterly a faute amonge you because ye goo to lawe one with another . Why rather suffer ye not wronge ? why rather suffre ye not youre selves to be robbed ?
46006008	Naye ye youre selves do wronge and robbe : and that the brethren .
46006009	Do ye not remember how that the vnrighteous shall not inheret the kyngdome of God ? Be not deceaved . For nether fornicators nether worshyppers of ymages nether whormongers nether weaklinges nether abusars of them selves with the mankynde
46006010	nether theves nether the coveteous nether dronkardes nether cursed speakers nether pillers shall inheret the kyngdome of God .
46006011	And soche ware ye verely : but ye are wesshed : ye are sanctified : ye are iustified by the name of the Lorde Iesus and by the sprete of oure God .
46006012	All thinges are lawfull vnto me : but all thinges are not proffitable . I maye do all thinges : but I will be brought vnder no mans power .
46006013	Meates are ordeyned for the belly and the belly for meates : but God shall destroy bothe it and them . Let not the body be applied vnto fornicacion but vnto the Lorde and the Lorde vnto the body .
46006014	God hath raysed vp the Lorde and shall rayse vs vp by his power .
46006015	Ether remember ye not that youre bodyes are the members of Christ ? Shall I now take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot ? God forbyd .
46006016	Do ye not vnderstonde that he which coupleth him selfe with an harlot is become one body ? For two ( saith he ) shalbe one flesshe .
46006017	But he that is ioyned vnto the Lorde is one sprete .
46006018	Fle fornicacion . All synnes that a man dothe are with out ye body . But he yt is a fornicator synneth agaynst his awne body .
46006019	Ether knowe ye not how that youre bodyes are the temple of ye holy goost which is in you who ye have of God and how that ye are not youre awne ?
46006020	For ye are dearly bought . Therfore glorifie ye God in youre bodyes and in youre spretes for they are goddes .
46007001	As concerninge the thinges wherof ye wrote vnto me : it is good for a ma not to touche a woman .
46007002	Neverthelesse to avoyde fornicacio let every man have his wyfe : and let every woman have her husbande .
46007003	Let the man geve vnto the wyfe due benevolence . Lykwyse also the wyfe vnto the man .
46007004	The wyfe hath not power over her awne body : but the husbande . And lykewyse the man hath not power over his awne body : but the wyfe .
46007005	Withdrawe not youre selves one from another excepte it be with consent for a tyme for to geve youre selves to fastynge and prayer . And afterwarde come agayne to the same thynge lest Satan tempt you for youre incontinencye .
46007006	This I saye of faveour not of comaundement .
46007007	For I wolde that all men were as I my selfe am : but every man hath his proper gyfte of God one after this maner another after that .
46007008	I saye vnto the vnmaried men and widdowes : it is good for them yf they abyde eve as I do .
46007009	But and yf they canot abstayne let them mary . For it is better to mary then to burne .
46007010	Vnto the maryed comaunde not I but the Lorde : that the wyfe separate not her selfe from the man .
46007011	Yf she separate her selfe let her remayne vnmaryed or be reconciled vnto her husbande agayne . And let not the husbande put awaye his wyfe from him .
46007012	To the remnaunt speake I and not the lorde . Yf eny brother have a wyfe that beleveth not yf she be content to dwell with him let him not put her awaye .
46007013	And ye woma which hath to her husbande an infidell yf he consent to dwell with her let her not put him awaye .
46007014	For ye vnbelevynge husbande is sanctified by the wyfe : and the vnbelevynge wyfe is sanctified by the husbande . Or els were youre chyldren vnclene : but now are they pure .
46007015	But and yf the vnbelevynge departe let him departe . A brother or a sister is not in subiection to soche . God hath called vs in peace .
46007016	For how knowest thou o woman whether thou shalt save that man or no ? Other how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save that woman or no ?
46007017	but even as God hath distributed to every man . As the lorde hath called every person so let him walke : and so orden I in all congregacios .
46007018	Yf eny man be called beynge circumcised let him adde nothinge therto . Yf eny be called vncircumcised : let him not be circucised .
46007019	Circumcision is nothinge vncircumcision is nothinge : but the kepyng of the comaundmentes of god is altogether .
46007020	Let every man abyde in the same state wherin he was called .
46007021	Arte thou called a servaut ? care not for it . Neverthelesse yf thou mayst be fre vse it rather .
46007022	For he that is called in the lorde beynge a servaunt is the lordes freman . Lykwyse he that is called beynge fre is Christes servaut .
46007023	Ye are dearly bought be not mennes seruauntes .
46007024	Brethren let everye man wherin he is called therin abyde with God .
46007025	As concernynge virgins I have no comaundment of the lorde : yet geve I counsell as one that hath obtayned mercye of the lorde to be faythfull .
46007026	I suppose that it is good for the present necessite . For it is good for a ma so to be .
46007027	Arte thou bounde vnto a wyfe ? seke not to be lowsed . Arte thou lowsed from a wyfe ? seke not a wyfe .
46007028	But and yf thou take a wyfe thou synnest not . Lykwyse if a virgin mary she synneth not . Neverthelesse soche shall have trouble in their flesshe : but I faver you .
46007029	This saye I brethre the tyme is shorte . It remayneth that they which have wives be as though they had none
46007030	and they that wepe be as though thy wept not : and they that reioyce be as though they reioysed not : and they that bye be as though they possessed not :
46007031	and they yt vse this worlde be as though they vsed it not . For the fassion of this worlde goeth awaye .
46007032	I wolde have you without care : the single man careth for the thinges of the lorde how he maye please the lorde .
46007033	But he that hath maried careth for the thinges of the worlde howe he maye please his wyfe .
46007034	There is differece bitwene a virgin and a wyfe . The single woman careth for the thinges of the lorde that she maye be pure both in body and also in sprete But she that is maryed careth for the thinges of the worlde how she maye please her husband .
46007035	This speake I for youre proffit not to tangle you in a snare : but for that which is honest and comly vnto you and that ye maye quyetly cleave vnto the lorde wt out separacion .
46007036	If eny man thinke that it is vncomly for his virgin if she passe the tyme of mariage ad if so nede requyre let him do what he listeth he synneth not : let the be coupled in mariage .
46007037	Neverthelesse he yt purposeth surely in his herte havynge none nede : but hath power over his awne will : and hath so decreed in his herte that he will kepe his virgin doth well .
46007038	So then he that ioyneth his virgin in maryage doth well . But he that ioyneth not his virgin in mariage doth better .
46007039	The wyfe is bounde to the lawe as longe as her husband liveth If her husbande slepe she is at liberte to mary with whom she wyll only in the lorde .
46007040	But she is happiar yf she so abyde in my iudgmet And I thinke verely that I have the sprete of God .
46008001	To speake of thinges dedicate vnto ydols we are sure that we all have knowledge . knowledge maketh a man swell : bnt love edifieth .
46008002	If eny man thinke that he knoweth eny thinge he knoweth nothynge yet as he ought to knowe .
46008003	But yf eny man love god the same is knowen of him .
46008004	To speake of meate dedicat vnto ydols we are sure that ther is none ydoll in the worlde and that ther is none other god but one .
46008005	And though ther be yt are called goddes whether in heven other in erth ( as ther be goddes many and lordes many )
46008006	yet vnto vs is there but one god which is the father of whom are all thinges and we in him : and one lorde Iesus Christ by whom are all thinges and we by him .
46008007	But every man hath not knowledge . For some suppose that ther is an ydoll vntyll this houre and eate as of a thinge offered vnto ye ydole and so their consciences beynge yet weake are defyled .
46008008	Meate maketh vs not acceptable to god . Nether yf we eate are we ye better . Nether yf we eate not are we the worsse .
46008009	But take hede that youre libertie cause not ye weake to faule .
46008010	For yf some man se ye which hast knowledge sit at meate in the ydoles teple shall not the conscience of hym which is weake be boldened to eate those thinges which are offered vnto ye ydole ?
46008011	And so thorow thy knowledge shall ye weake brother perisshe for whom christ dyed .
46008012	Whe ye synne so agaynst the brethren and wounde their weake consciences ye synne agaynst Christ .
46008013	Wherfore yf meate hurt my brother I will eate no flesshe whill the worlde stondeth because I will not hurte my brother .
46009001	Am I not an Apostle ? am I not fre ? have I not sene Iesus Christ oure lorde ?
46009002	Are not ye my worke in the lorde . Yf I be not an Apostle vnto other yet am I vnto you . For the seale of myne Apostleshippe are ye in the lorde .
46009003	Myne answer to them that axe me is this .
46009004	Have we not power to eate and to drynke ?
46009005	Ether have we not power to leade about a sister to wyfe as wel as other Apostles and as the brethren of the lorde and Cephas ?
46009006	Ether only I and Barnabas have not power this to do ?
46009007	who goeth a warfare eny tyme at his awne cost ? who planteth a vynearde and eateth not of the frute ? Who fedeth a flocke and eateth not of the mylke ?
46009008	Saye I these thinges after the manner of men ? Or sayth not the lawe the same also ?
46009009	For it ys written in the lawe of Moses . Thou shall not mosell the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the corne . Doth God take thought for oxen ?
46009010	Ether sayth he it not all to gedder for oure sakes ? For oure sakes no doute this is written : that he which eareth shuld eare in hope : and that he which thressheth in hope shuld be parttaker of his hope .
46009011	Yf we sowe vnto you spirituall thynges : is it a greate thynge yf we reepe youre carnall thynges
46009012	Yf other be parttakers of this power over you ? wherfore are not we rather . Neverthelesse we have not vsed this power : but suffre all thinges lest we shuld hynder the gospell of Christ .
46009013	Do ye not vnderstoder how that they which minister in the temple have their fyndynge of the temple ? And they which wayte at the aulter are partakers with ye aultre ?
46009014	Even so also dyd ye lorde ordayne that they which preache ye gospell shuld live of the gospell .
46009015	But I have vsed none of these thinges . Nether wrote I these thinges that it shuld be so done vnto me . For it were better for me to dye the yt eny man shnld take this reioysinge from me .
46009016	In that I preache the gospell I have nothinge to reioyce of . For necessite is put vnto me . Wo is it vnto me yf I preache not the gospell .
46009017	If I do it with a good will I have a rewarde . But yf I do it agaynst my will an office is committed vnto me .
46009018	What is my rewarde then ? Verely that whe I preache the gospell I make the gospell of Christ fre yt I misvse not myne auctorite in ye gospel
46009019	For though I be fre from all men yet have I made my silfe servaunt vnto all men that I myght wynne the moo .
46009020	Vnto the Iewes I became as a Iewe to winne ye Iewes . To the that were vnder the lawe was I made as though I had bene vnder the lawe to wynne the that were vnder the lawe .
46009021	To them that were without lawe be ca I as though I had bene without lawe ( whe I was not without lawe as perteyninge to god but vnder a lawe as concerninge Christ ) to wynne the that were without lawe .
46009022	To the weake became I as weake to wynne the weake . In all thinge I fassioned my silfe to all men to save at ye lest waye some .
46009023	And this I do for the gospels sake that I might have my parte therof .
46009024	Perceave ye not how that they which runne in a course runne all yet but one receaveth the rewarde . So runne that ye maye obtayne .
46009025	Euery man yt proveth masteryes abstaineth from all thinges . And they do it to obtayne a corruptible croune : but we to obtayne an vncorruptible croune :
46009026	I therfore so runne not as at an vncertayne thinge . So fyght I not as one yt beateth the ayer :
46009027	but I tame my body and bringe it into subieccio lest after that I have preached to other I my silfe shuld be a castawaye .
46010001	Brethren I wolde not that ye shuld be ignoraunt of this how yt oure fathers were all vnder a cloude and all passed thorow the see
46010002	and were all baptised vnder Moses in the cloude and in the see :
46010003	and dyd all eate of one spirituall meate
46010004	and did all drincke of one maner of spirituall drincke . And they dranke of that spretuall rocke that folowed them which rocke was Christ .
46010005	But in many of them had god no delite . For they were overthrowen in the wildernes .
46010006	These are ensamples to vs that we shuld not lust after evyll thinges as they lusted
46010007	Nether be ye worshippers of Images as were some of them accordynge as it is written : The people sate doune to eate and drynke and rose vp agayne to playe .
46010008	Nether let vs comit fornicacion as some of them committed fornicacion and were destroyed in one daye . xxiii . thousande .
46010009	Nether let vs tempte Christ as some of them tempted and were destroyed of serpentes .
46010010	Nether murmure ye as some of them murmured and were destroyed of ye destroyer
46010011	All these thinges happened vnto them for ensamples and were written to put vs in remembraunce whom the endes of the worlde are come apon .
46010012	Wherfore let hym that thynketh he stodeth take hede least he fall .
46010013	There hath none other temptacion taken you but soche as foloweth ye nature of ma . But God is faythfull which shall not suffer you to be tempted above youre strenght : but shall in the myddes of the temptacion make awaye to escape out .
46010014	Wherfore my deare beloued fle from worshippynge of ydols .
46010015	I speake as vnto them which have discrecion Iudge ye what I saye .
46010016	Ys not the cuppe of blessinge which we blesse partakynge of ye bloude of Christ ? ys not the breed which we breake partetakynge of the body of Christ ?
46010017	because that we ( though we be many ) yet are one breed and one bodye in as moch as we all are partetakers of one breed .
46010018	Beholde Israhell which walketh carnally . Are not they which eate of the sacrifyse partetakers of the aultre ?
46010019	What saye I then ? that the ymage is eny thinge ? or that it which is offered to ymages is eny thinge ?
46010020	Nay but I saye that those thinges which the gentyle offer they offer to devyls and not to god . And I wolde not that ye shuld have fellishippe with ye devils
46010021	Ye canot drincke of the cup of the lorde and of yt cup of ye deuyls . Ye cnanot be partetakers of the lordes table and of the table of deuelles .
46010022	Ether shall we provoke the lorde ? Or are we stronger then he ? All thynges are laufull vnto me but all thynges are not expedient .
46010023	All thynges are lawfull to me but all thinges edifye not .
46010024	Let no man seke his awne proffet : but let every man seke anothers welthe .
46010025	What soever is solde in the market that eate and axe no questions for conscience sake
46010026	For the erth is the lordis and all that therein is .
46010027	Yf eny of them which beleve not bid you to a feest and yf ye be disposed to goo what soever is seet before you : eate axinge no question for conscience sake .
46010028	But and yf eny man saye vnto you : this is dedicate vnto ydols eate not of it for his sake that shewed it and for hurtynge of conscience . The erth is the lordes and all that there in is .
46010029	Conscience I saye not thyne : but the coscieuce of that other . For why shuld my liberte be iudged of another manes conscience :
46010030	For yf I take my parte with thakes : why am I evell spoken of for that thynge wherfore I geve thankes .
46010031	Whether therfore ye eate or dryncke or what soever ye do do all to the prayse of God .
46010032	Se that ye geve occasion of evell nether to ye Iewes nor yet to the gentyls nether to ye cogregacion of god :
46010033	euen as I please all men in all thinges not sekynge myne awne proffet but the proffet of many that they myght be saved . Folowe me as I do Christ .
46011001	I commende you
46011002	brethren that ye remeber me in all thinges and kepe the ordinaunces even as I delyvered them to you .
46011003	I wolde ye knew that Christ is the heed of every man . And the man is the womans heed . And God is Christes heed .
46011004	Eevery ma prayinge or prophesyinge havynge eny thynge on his heed shameth his heed .
46011005	Every woman that prayeth or prophisieth bare hedded dishonesteth hyr heed . For it is even all one and the very same thinge even as though she were shaven .
46011006	If the woman be not covered lett her also be shoren . If it be shame for a woma to be shorne or shave let her cover her heed .
46011007	A man ought not to cover his heed for as moche as he is the image and glory of God . The woman is the glory of the man .
46011008	For the man is not of the woman but the woman of the ma .
46011009	Nether was the man created for ye womas sake : but the woma for the mannes sake
46011010	For this cause ought the woma to have power on her heed for the angels sakes .
46011011	Neverthelesse nether is the ma with oute the woma nether the woma with out the man in the lorde .
46011012	For as the woman is of the man eve so is the man by the woman : but all is of God .
46011013	Iudge in youre selves whether it be coly yt a woman praye vnto god bare heeded .
46011014	Or els doth not nature teach you that it is a shame for a man
46011015	if he have longe heere : and a prayse to a woman yf she have longe heere ? For her heere is geven her to cover her with all .
46011016	If there be eny man amonge you yt lusteth to stryve let him knowe that we have no soche custome nether the congregacions of God .
46011017	This I warne you of and commende not that ye come to gedder : not after a better maner but after a worsse .
46011018	Fyrst of all when ye come togedder in the cogregacion I heare that ther is dissencion amonge you : and I partly beleve it .
46011019	For ther must be sectes amonge you that they which are perfecte amonge you myght be knowen .
46011020	When ye come to gedder a man cannot eate the lordes supper . For every man begynneth a fore to eate his awne supper .
46011021	And one is hongrye and another is dronken . Have ye not houses to eate and to drinke in ?
46011022	Or els despyse ye the congregacion of god and shame them that have not ? What shall I saye vnto you ? shall I prayse you : In this prayse I you not .
46011023	That which I delyvered vnto you I receaved of ye lorde . For ye lorde Iesus the same nyght in which he was betrayed toke breed :
46011024	and thanked and brake and sayde . Take ye and eate ye : this is my body which is broken for you . This do ye in the remembraunce of me .
46011025	After the same maner he toke the cup when sopper was done sayinge . This cup is the newe testament in my bloude . This do as oft as ye drynke it in the remebraunce of me .
46011026	For as often as ye shall eate this breed and drynke this cup ye shall shewe the lordes deeth tyll he come .
46011027	Wherfore whosoevere shall eate of this bred or drynke of the cup vnworthely shalbe giltie of the body and bloud of the Lorde
46011028	Let a ma therfore examen him silfe and so let hi eate of the breed and drynke of the cup .
46011029	For he yt eateth or drinketh vnworthely eateth and drynketh his awne damnacion because he maketh no difference of the lordis body .
46011030	For this cause many are weake and sicke amoge you and many slepe .
46011031	Yf we had truly iudged oure selves we shuld not have bene iudged .
46011032	But when we are iudged of the lorde we are chastened because we shuld not be daned with the worlde .
46011033	Wherfore my brethren when ye come to gedder to eate tary one for another .
46011034	Yf eny ma hoger let hi eate at home yt ye come not togedder vnto condenacio . Other thinges will I set in order whe I come .
46012001	In spirituall thinges brethren I wolde not have you ignoraunt .
46012002	Ye knowe that ye were gentyls and went youre wayes vnto domme ydoles even as ye were ledde .
46012003	Wherfore I declare vnto you that no man speakynge in the sprete of god defieth Iesus . Also no man can saye that Iesus is the lorde : but by the holy goost .
46012004	Ther are diversities of gyftes verely yet but one sprete .
46012005	And ther are differences of administracions and yet but one lorde .
46012006	And ther are divers maners of operacions and yet but one God which worketh all thinges that are wrought in all creatures .
46012007	The gyftes of ye sprete are geven to every man to proffit ye congregacion .
46012008	To one is geven thorow the spirite the vtteraunce of wisdome ? To another is geven the vtteraunce of knowledge by ye same sprete .
46012009	To another is geuen fayth by ye same sprete . To another ye gyftes of healynge by the same sprete .
46012010	To another power to do myracles . To another prophesie ? To another iudgement of spretes . To another divers tonges . To another the interpretacion of toges .
46012011	And these all worketh eve ye silfe same sprete devydynge to every man severall gyftes even as he will .
46012012	For as the body is one and hath many mebres and all the membres of one body though they be many yet are but one body : even so is Christ .
46012013	For in one sprete are we all baptysed to make one body whether we be Iewes or getyls whether we be bonde or fre : and have all dronke of one sprete .
46012014	For the body is not one member but many .
46012015	Yf the fote saye : I am not the honde therfore I am not of the body : is he therfore not of ye body :
46012016	And if ye eare saye I am not the eye : therfore I am not of the body : is he therfore not of the body ?
46012017	If all the body were an eye where were then the eare ? If all were hearynge : where were the smellynge ?
46012018	But now hath god disposed the membres every one of them in the body at his awne pleasure .
46012019	If they were all one member : where were the body ?
46012020	Now are ther many membres yet but one body .
46012021	And the eye can not saye vnto the honde I have no nede of the : nor ye heed also to the fete . I have no nede of you .
46012022	Ye rather a greate deale those mebres of the body which seme to be most feble are most necessary .
46012023	And apo those mebres of yt body which we thinke lest honest put we most honestie on . And oure vngodly parties have most beauty on .
46012024	For oure honest members nede it not . But God hath so disposed the body ad hath geven most honoure to that parte which laked
46012025	lest there shuld be eny stryfe in the body : but that the members shuld indifferetly care one for another .
46012026	And yf one member suffer all suffer with him : yf one member be had in honoure all members be glad also .
46012027	Ye are the body of Christ and members one of another .
46012028	And God hath also ordeyned in the congregacion fyrst the Apostels secodarely prophetes thyrdly teachers then the that do miracles : after that the gyftes of healynge helpers governers diversite of tonges .
46012029	Are all Apostles ? Are all Prophetes ? Are all teachers ? Are all doars of miracles ?
46012030	Have all the gyftes of healinge ? Do all speake wt tonges ? Do all interprete ?
46012031	Covet after ye best giftes . Amd yet shewe I vnto you a moare excellent waye .
46013001	Though I spake with the tonges of me and angels and yet had no love I were eve as soundinge brasse : or as a tynklynge Cymball .
46013002	And though I coulde prophesy and vnderstode all secretes and all knowledge : yee yf I had all fayth so that I coulde move moutayns oute of ther places and yet had no love I were nothynge .
46013003	And though I bestowed all my gooddes to fede ye poore and though I gave my body even that I burned and yet had no love it profeteth me nothinge .
46013004	Love suffreth longe and is corteous . Love envieth not . Love doth not frowardly swelleth not dealeth
46013005	not dishonestly seketh not her awne is not provoked to anger thynketh not evyll
46013006	reioyseth not in iniquite : but reioyseth in ye trueth
46013007	suffreth all thynge beleveth all thynges hopeth all thynges endureth in all thynges .
46013008	Though that prophesyinge fayle other tonges shall cease ) or knowledge vanysshe awaye yet love falleth never awaye
46013009	For oure knowledge is vnparfect and oure prophesyinge is vnperfet .
46013010	But when yt which is parfect is come then yt which is vnparfet shall be done awaye .
46013011	When I was a chylde I spake as a chylde I vnderstode as a childe I ymagened as a chylde . But assone as I was a man I put awaye childesshnes .
46013012	Now we se in a glasse even in a darke speakynge : but then shall we se face to face . Now I knowe vnparfectly : but then shall I knowe even as I am knowen .
46013013	Now abideth fayth hope and love even these thre : but the chefe of these is love .
46014001	Labour for love and covet spretuall giftes : and most chefly forto prophesye .
46014002	For he that speaketh with toges speaketh not vnto men but vnto god for no man heareth him how be it in the sprete he speaketh misteries .
46014003	But he that prophesieth speaketh vnto men to edifyinge to exhortacion and to comforte .
46014004	He that speaketh with tonges proffiteth him silfe : he that prophesyeth edifieth the congregacion .
46014005	I wolde that ye all spake with tonges : but rather that ye prophesied . For greater is he that prophisieth ? then he yt speaketh with tonges except he expounde it also that the congregacion maye have edifyinge .
46014006	Now brehren if I come vnto you speakige wt tonges : what shall I profit you excepte I speake vnto you other by revelacio or knowledge or prophesyinge or doctrine .
46014007	Moreover whe thinges with out lyfe geve sounde : whether it be a pype or an harpe : except they make a distinccion in the soundes : how shall it be knowen what is pyped or harped ?
46014008	And also if the trope geve an vncertayne voyce who shall prepare him silfe to fyght ?
46014009	Eve so lykwyse whe ye speake with toges excepte ye speake wordes that have signification how shall yt be vnderstonde what is spoke ? For ye shall but speake in the ayer .
46014010	Many kyndes of voyces are in the worlde and none of them are with out signification .
46014011	If I knowe not what the voyce meaneth I shalbe vnto him that speaketh an alient : and and he that speaketh shalbe an alient vnto me
46014012	Eve so ye ( for as moche as ye covet spretuall giftes ) seke that ye maye have plentye vnto ye edifyinge of the congregacion .
46014013	Wherfore let him that speaketh with tonges praye that he maye interpret also .
46014014	If I praye with tonge my sprete prayeth : but my mynde is with out frute .
46014015	What is it then ? I will praye with the sprete ad will praye wt the mynde also . I will singe with the sprete and will singe with the mynde also .
46014016	For els when thou blessest with ye sprete how shall he that occupieth the roume of the vnlearned saye amen at thy gevinge of thankes seynge he vnderstondeth not what thou sayest .
46014017	Thou verely gevest thankes well but the other is not edyfied .
46014018	I thanke my god I speake with toges moare then ye all .
46014019	Yet had I lever in ye cogregacio to speake five wordes with my mynde to ye informacio of other rather then ten thousande wordes wt the tonge .
46014020	Brethre be not chyldre in witte . How be it as cocerninge maliciousnes be chyldre : but in witte be perfet .
46014021	In the lawe it is written with other toges and with other lyppes wyll I speake vnto this people and yet for all that will they not heare me sayth the Lorde .
46014022	Wherfore tonges are for a signe not to them that beleve : but to them that beleve not . Contrary wyse prophesyinge serveth not for them that beleve not : but for them which beleve .
46014023	Yf therfore when all the cogregacion is come to gedder and all speake with tonges ther come in they yt are vnlearned or they which beleve not : will they not saye that ye are out of youre wittes ?
46014024	But and yf all prophesy and ther come in one that beleveth not or one vnlearned he is rebuked of all men and is iudged of every man :
46014025	and so are ye secretes of his hert opened and so falleth he doune on his face and worshippeth God and sayth yt God is wt you in dede .
46014026	How is it then brethre ? When ye come to gedder every ma hath his songe hath his doctryne hath his toge hath his revelacio hath his interpretacio . Let all thinges be done vnto edifyinge .
46014027	If eny man speake wt tonges let it be two at once or at the most thre at once and that by course : and let another interprete it .
46014028	But yf ther be no interpreter let him kepe silence in the cogregacion and let him speake to him selfe and to God .
46014029	Let the Prophetes speake two at once or thre at once and let other iudge .
46014030	Yf eny revelacio be made to another that sitteth by let the fyrst holde his peace .
46014031	For ye maye all prophesy one by one that all maye learne and all maye have comforte .
46014032	For ye spretes of the Prophetes are in the power of the Prophetes .
46014033	For God is not causer of stryfe : but of peace as he is in all other congregacions of the saynctes .
46014034	Let youre wyves kepe silence in the cogregacions . For it is not permitted vnto them to speake : but let them be vnder obedience as sayth the lawe .
46014035	If they will learne enythinge let the axe their husbandes at home . For it is a shame for wemen to speake in the cogregacio .
46014036	Sproge ye worde of god fro you ? Ether came it vnto you only ?
46014037	Yf eny ma thinke him sylfe a prophet ether spirituall : let him vnderstonde what thinges I write vnto you . For they are the comaundementes of the Lorde .
46014038	But and yf eny man be ignorat let him be ignorant .
46014039	Wherfore brethren covet to prophesye and forbyd not to speake with tonges .
46014040	And let all thinges be done honestly and in order .
46015001	Brethren as pertayninge to the gospell which I preached vnto you which ye have also accepted and in the which ye continue
46015002	by which also ye are saved : I do you to wit after what maner I preached vnto you yf ye kepe it except ye have beleved in vayne .
46015003	For fyrst of all I delivered vnto you that which I receaved : how that Christ dyed for oure synnes agreinge to the scriptures :
46015004	and that he was buried and that he arose agayne the thyrd daye accordinge to the scriptures :
46015005	and that he he was sene of Cephas then of the twelve .
46015006	After that he was sene of moo the five hodred brethren at once : of which many remayne vnto this daye and many are fallen aslepe .
46015007	After that appered he to Iames then to all the Apostles .
46015008	And last of all he was sene of me as of one that was borne out of due tyme .
46015009	For I am the lest of all the Apostles which am not worthy to be called an Apostle because I persecuted the congregacion of God .
46015010	But by the grace of God I am that I am . And his grace which is in me was not in vayne : but I labored moare aboundauntly then they all not I but the grace of God which is with me .
46015011	Whether it were I or they so we preache and so have ye beleved .
46015012	If Christ be preached how that he rose fro deeth : how saye some that are amoge you that ther is no resurreccion from deeth ?
46015013	If ther be no rysynge agayne from deeth : then is Christ not rysen .
46015014	If Christ be not rysen then is oure preachinge vayne and youre faith is also in vayne .
46015015	Ye and we are founde falce witnesses of God . For we have testifyed of God how that he raysyd vp Christ whom he raysyd not vp yf it be so that the deed ryse not vp agayne .
46015016	For yf the deed ryse not agayne then is Christ not rysen agayne .
46015017	If it be so yt Christ rose not then is youre fayth in vayne and yet are ye in youre synnes .
46015018	And therto they which are fallen a slepe in Christ are perished .
46015019	If in this lyfe only we beleve on christ then are we of all men the miserablest .
46015020	But now is Christ rysen from deeth and is become the fyrst frutes of them that slept .
46015021	For by a man came deeth and by a man came resurreccion fro deeth .
46015022	For as by Adam all dye : eve so by Christ shall all be made alive
46015023	and every man in his awne order . The fyrst is Christ then they yt are Christis at his commynge .
46015024	Then cometh the ende when he hath delivered vp ye kyngdome to God ye father when he hath put doune all rule auctorite and power .
46015025	For he must raygne tyll he have put all his enemyes vnder his fete .
46015026	The last enemye that shalbe destroyed is deeth .
46015027	For he hath put all thinges vnder his fete . But when he sayth all thinges are put vnder him it is manyfest that he is excepted which dyd put all thinges vnder him .
46015028	When all thinges are subdued vnto him : then shall the sonne also him selfe be subiecte vnto him that put all thinges vnder him yt God maye be all in all thinges .
46015029	Ether els what do they which are baptised over ye deed yf the deed ryse not at all ? Why are they then baptised over the deed ?
46015030	Ye and why stonde we in ieoperdy every houre ?
46015031	By oure reioysinge which I have in Christ Iesu oure Lorde I dye dayly .
46015032	That I have fought with beastes at Ephesus after the maner of men what avautageth it me yf the deed ryse not agayne ? Let vs eate and drynke to morowe we shall dye .
46015033	Be not deceaved : malicious speakinges corrupte good maners .
46015034	Awake truely out of slepe and synne not . For some have not the knowlege of God . I speake this vnto youre rebuke .
46015035	But some ma will saye : how aryse ye deed ? with what bodyes come they in ?
46015036	Thou fole that which thou sowest is not quickened except it dye .
46015037	And what sowest thow ? Thow sowest not that body that shalbe : but bare corne ( I meane ether of wheet or of some other )
46015038	and God geveth it a body at his pleasure to every seed a severall body .
46015039	All flesshe is not one manner of flesshe : but ther is one maner flesshe of men another maner flesshe of beastes another maner flesshe of fysshes and another of byrdes .
46015040	Ther are celestiall bodyes and ther are bodyes terrestriall . But ye glory of ye celestiall is one and ye glory of the terrestriall is another .
46015041	Ther is one maner glory of the sonne and another glory of the mone and another glory of the starres . For one starre differth fro another in glory .
46015042	So is the resurreccio of ye deed . It is sowe in corrupcio and ryseth in incorrupcion .
46015043	It is sowen in dishonoure and ryseth in honoure . It is sowe in weaknes and ryseth in power . It is sowne a naturall body and ryseth a spretuall body .
46015044	Ther is a naturall bodye and ther is a spretuall body :
46015045	as it is written : the fyrste man Adam was made a livinge soule : and ye last Ada was made a quickeninge sprete .
46015046	How be it yt is not fyrst which is spirituall : but yt which is naturall and then yt which is spretuall .
46015047	The fyrst ma is of the erth erthy : the seconde man is ye Lorde fro heave .
46015048	As is the erthy soche are they that are erthye . And as is the hevely soche are they yt are hevenly .
46015049	And as we have borne the ymage of the erthy so shall we beare the ymage of the hevenly .
46015050	This saye I brethren that flesshe and bloud canot inheret the kyngdome of God . Nether corrupcion inhereth vncorrupcion .
46015051	Beholde I shewe you a mystery . We shall not all slepe : but we shall all be chaunged
46015052	and that in a moment and in the twinclinge of an eye at the sounde of the last trompe . For the trompe shall blowe and ye deed shall ryse incorruptible and we shalbe chaunged .
46015053	For this corruptible must put on incorruptibilite : and this mortall must put on immortalite .
46015054	When this corruptible hath put on incorruptibilite and this mortall hath put on immortalite : then shalbe brought to passe ye sayinge yt is writte . Deeth is consumed in to victory .
46015055	Deeth where is thy stynge ? Hell where is thy victory ?
46015056	The stynge of deeth is synne : and the strength of synne is the lawe .
46015057	But thankes be vnto God which hath geven vs victory thorow oure Lorde Iesus Christ .
46015058	Therfore my deare brethren be ye stedfast and unmovable alwayes ryche in the workes of the Lorde for as moch as ye knowe how yt youre labour is not in vayne in the Lorde .
46016001	Of the gadderynge for the saynctes as I have ordeyned in the congregacios of Galacia even so do ye .
46016002	Vpon some sondaye let every one of you put a syde at home and laye vp what soever he thinketh mete that ther be no gaderinges when I come .
46016003	When I am come whosoever ye shall alowe by youre letters them will I sende to bringe youre liberalite vnto Ierusalem .
46016004	And yf it be mete yt I goo they shall go with me .
46016005	I will come vnto you after I have gone over Macedonia . For I will goo thorowout Macedonia .
46016006	With you paraveture I wyll abyde awhyle : or els winter that ye maye brynge me on my waye whyther soever I goo .
46016007	I will not se you now in my passage : but I trust to abyde a whyle with you yf God shall suffre me .
46016008	I will tary at Ephesus untyll whit sontyde .
46016009	For a greate dore and a frutefull is opened vnto me : and ther are many adversaries .
46016010	If Timotheus come se yt he be with out feare with you . For he worketh the worke of the Lorde as I doo .
46016011	Let no man despyse him : but convaye him forthe in peace yt he maye come vnto me . For I loke for him with the brethre .
46016012	To speake of brother Apollo : I greatly desyred him to come vnto you with ye brethren but his mynde was not at all to come at this tyme . How be it he will come when he shall have conveniet tyme .
46016013	Watche ye stonde fast in the fayth auyte you lyke men and be stronge .
46016014	Let all youre busynes be done in love .
46016015	Brethren ( ye knowe the housse of Stephana how yt they are the fyrst frutes of Achaia and that they have appoynted them selves to minister vnto the saynctes )
46016016	I beseche you yt ye be obedient vnto soche and to all that helpe and laboure .
46016017	I am gladde of the comynge of Stephana Fortunatus and Achaicus : for that which was lackinge on youre parte they have supplied .
46016018	They have comforted my sprete and youres . Loke therfore that ye knowe them that are soche .
46016019	The congregacions of Asia salute you . Aquila and Priscilla salute you moche in the Lorde and so doeth the congregacio that is in their housse .
46016020	All the brethren grete you . Grete ye one another with an holy kysse .
46016021	The salutacion of me Paul with myne awne hande .
46016022	Yf eny man love not the Lorde Iesus Christ the same be anathema maranatha .
46016023	The grace of ye Lorde Iesus Christ be with you all .
46016024	My love be with you all in Christ Iesu . Ame
47001001	Paul an Apostle of Iesu Christ by the will of God and brother Timotheus . Vnto the congregacion of God which is at Corinthu with all the saynctes which are in all Achaia .
47001002	Grace be with you and peace from God oure father and from the Lorde Iesus Christ .
47001003	Blessed be God ye father of oure Lorde Iesus Christ the father of mercy and the God of all comforte
47001004	which comforteth vs in all oure tribulacio in so moche yt we are able to coforte them which are troubled in whatsoever tribulacion it be with the same comforte wher with we oure selves are coforted of God .
47001005	For as ye affliccios of Christ are pleteous in vs eve so is oure consolacio plenteous by Christ .
47001006	Whether we be troubled for youre consolacion and salvacio which salvacion sheweth her power in yt ye soffre ye same affliccios which we also suffre : or whether we be coforted for youre consolacion and salvacion :
47001007	yet oure hope is stedfast for you in as moch as we know how that as ye have youre parte in affliccios so shall ye be parttakers of consolacion .
47001008	Brethren I wolde not have you ignoraut of oure trouble which happened vnto vs in Asia . For we were greved out of measure passynge strength so greatly that we despeared even of lyfe .
47001009	Also we receaved an answer of deeth in oure selves and that because we shuld not put oure trust in oure selves : but in God which rayseth the deed to lyfe agayne
47001010	and which delivered vs from so gret a deeth and doth delivre . On whom we trust yt yet hereafter he will deliver
47001011	by the helpe of youre prayer for vs : that by the meanes of many occasions thankes maye be geven of many on oure behalfe for the grace geven vnto vs .
47001012	Oure reioysynge is this the testimony of oure coscience yt in synglenes and godly purenes and not in flesshly wysdome but by the grace of God we have had oure conuersacion in the worlde and most of all to you wardes .
47001013	We write no nother thinges vnto you then that ye reade and also knowe . Yee and I trust ye shall fynde vs vnto the ende even as ye have founde vs partly :
47001014	for we are youre reioysynge even as ye are oures in the daye of the Lorde Iesus .
47001015	And in this confidence was I mynded the other tyme to have come vnto you that ye myght have had yet one pleasure moare :
47001016	and to have passed by you into Macedonia and to have come agayne out of Macedonia vnto you and to have bene ledde forth to Iewrye warde of you .
47001017	When I thus wyse was mynded : dyd I vse lightnes ? Or thinke I carnally those thinges which I thinke ? that with me shuld be ye ye and naye naye .
47001018	God is faythfull : For oure preachynge vnto you was not ye and naye .
47001019	For Goddis sonne Iesus Christ which was preached amonge you by vs ( that is to saye by me and Silvanus and Timotheus ) was not ye and naye : but in him it was ye .
47001020	For all the promyses of God in him are ye : and are in him Amen vnto the lawde of God thorow vs .
47001021	For it is God which stablissheth vs and you in Christ and hath annoynted vs
47001022	which hath also sealed vs and hath geven the ernest of the sprete into oure hertes .
47001023	I call God for a recorde vnto my soule that forto faver you with all I came not enymoare vnto Corinthum .
47001024	Not that we be lordes over youre fayth : but helpers of youre ioye . For by fayth ye stode .
47002001	But I determened this in my silfe yt I wolde not come agayne to you in hevines .
47002002	For yf I make you sorye who is it that shuld make me glad but the same which is made sory by me ?
47002003	And I wrote this same pistle vnto you lest yf I came I shuld take hevynes of them of whom I ought to reioyce . Certaynly this confidence have I in you all that my ioye is the ioye of you all .
47002004	For in great affliccion and anguysshe of hert I wrote vnto you with many teares : not to make you sory but that ye myght perceave the love which I have most specially vnto you .
47002005	If eny man hath caused sorow the same hath not made me sory but partely : lest I shuld greve you all .
47002006	It is sufficient vnto the same man that he was rebuked of many .
47002007	So that now contrary wyse ye ought to forgeve him and comforte him : lest that same persone shuld be swalowed vp with over moche hevines .
47002008	Wherfore I exhorte you that love maye have stregth over him .
47002009	For this cause verely dyd I write that I myght knowe the profe of you whether ye shuld be obediet in all thinges .
47002010	To whom ye forgeve enythinge I forgeve also . And verely if I forgeve enythinge to whom I forgave it for youre sakes forgave I it in the roume of Christ
47002011	lest Satan shuld prevet vs . For his thoughtes are not vnknowen vnto vs .
47002012	When I was come to Troada for Christes gospels sake ( and a great dore was openned vnto me of the Lorde )
47002013	I had no rest in my sprete because I founde not Titus my brother : but toke my leave of them and went awaye into Macedonia .
47002014	Thankes be vnto God which alwayes geveth vs the victorie in Christ and openeth the saver of his knowledge by vs in every place .
47002015	For we are vnto God the swete savoure of Christ both amoge them that are saved and also amoge them which perisshe .
47002016	To the one parte are we ye savoure of deeth vnto deeth . And vnto the other parte are we the savoure of lyfe vnto lyfe . And who is mete vnto these thinges ?
47002017	For we are not as many are which choppe and chaunge with the worde of God : but even oute of purenes and by the power of God and in the sight of God so speake we in Christ .
47003001	We begyn to prayse oure selves agayne . Nede we as some other of pistles of recommendacion vnto you ? or letters of recomendacion from you ?
47003002	Ye are oure pistle written in oure hertes which is vnderstonde and reed of all men
47003003	in that ye are knowen how that ye are the pistle of Christ ministred by vs and written not with ynke : but with the sprete of the livynge God not in tables of stone but in flesshly tables of ye herte .
47003004	Suche trust have we thorow Christ to god ward
47003005	not that we are sufficient of oure selves to thinke enythinge as it were of oure selves : but oure ablenes cometh of God
47003006	which hath made vs able to minister the newe testamet not of the letter but of the sprete . For the letter kylleth but the sprete geveth lyfe .
47003007	Yf the ministracion of deeth thorow the letters figured in stones was glorious so yt the chyldren of Israel coulde not beholde the face of Moses for the glory of his countenauce ( which glory neverthelesse is done awaye )
47003008	why shall not the ministracion of the sprete be moche more glorious ?
47003009	For if ye ministringe of condempnacio beglorious : moche more do the the ministracion of rightewesnes excede in glory .
47003010	For no dout that which was there glorified is not once glorified in respecte of this excedynge glory .
47003011	Then if that which is destroyed was glorious moche more shall that which remayneth be glorious .
47003012	Seynge then that we have soche trust we vse gret boldnes
47003013	and do not as Moses which put a vayle over his face that the children of Israel shuld not se for what purpose that served which is put awaye .
47003014	But their myndes were blinded . For untill this daye remayneth the same coveringe vntake awaye in the olde testamet when they reade it which in Christ is put awaye .
47003015	But even vnto this daye when Moses is redde ye vayle hangeth before their hertes .
47003016	Neverthelesse when they tourne to ye Lorde the vayle shalbe taken awaye .
47003017	The Lorde no dout is a sprete . And where the sprete of the Lorde is there is libertie .
47003018	But we all beholde the glorye of the Lorde with his face open and are chaunged vnto the same similitude from glory to glory even of the sprite of the Lorde .
47004001	Therfore seinge that we have soche an office eve as mercy is come on vs we faynte not :
47004002	but have cast from vs the clokes of vnhonestie and walke not in craftines nether corrupte we the worde of God : but walke in open trueth and reporte oure selves to every mannes conscience in the sight of God .
47004003	Yf oure Gospell be yet hyd it is hid amoge them that are lost
47004004	in whom ye god of this worlde hath blynded the myndes of them which beleve not lest the light of ye glorious gospell of Christ which is the ymage of god shuld shyne vnto them .
47004005	For we preache not oure selves but Christ Iesus to be the Lorde and oure selves youre servautes for Iesus sake .
47004006	For it is God that commauded the light to shyne out of darcknes which hath shyned in oure hertes for to geve the light of the knowledge of the glorie of God in the face of Iesus Christ .
47004007	But we have this treasure in erthe vessels that ye excellent power of it myght appere to be of God and not of vs .
47004008	We are troubled on every side yet are we not with out shyft . We are in povertie : but not vtterly without somwhat .
47004009	We are persecuted : but are not forsake . We are cast doune : neverthelesse we perisshe not .
47004010	And we all wayes beare in oure bodyes the dyinge of the Lorde Iesus that the lyfe of Iesu myght appere in oure bodyes .
47004011	For we which live are alwayes delyvered vnto deeth for Iesus sake yt the lyfe also of Iesu myght appere in oure mortall flesshe .
47004012	So then deeth worketh in vs and lyfe in you .
47004013	Seynge then yt we have ye same sprete of fayth accordinge as it is writte : I beleved and therfore have I spoken . We also beleve and therfore speake .
47004014	For we knowe that he which raysed vp the Lorde Iesus shall rayse vp vs also by the meanes of Iesus and shall seet vs with you .
47004015	For all thinges do I for youre sakes that the plenteous grace by thankes geve of many maye redounde to the prayse of god .
47004016	Wherfore we are not weried but though oure vttward man perisshe yet the inwarde man is renewed daye by daye .
47004017	For oure excedinge tribulacion which is momentany and light prepareth an excedinge and an eternall wayght of glorye
47004018	vnto vs whill we loke not on the thynges which are sene but on ye thynges which are not sene . For thinges which are sene are temporall : but thynges which are not sene are eternall
47005001	We knowe suerly yf oure erthy mancion wherin we now dwell were destroyed that we have a bildinge ordeyned of god an habitacion not made with hondes but eternall in heve .
47005002	And herefore sigh we desyringe to be clothed wt oure mansion which is from heven :
47005003	so yet if that we be founde clothed and not naked .
47005004	For as longe as we are in this tabernacle we sigh and are greved for we wold not be vnclothed but wolde be clothed apon that mortalite myght be swalowed vp of lyfe .
47005005	He that hath ordeyned vs for this thynge ys god which very same hath geven vnto vs the ernest of the sprete .
47005006	Therfore we are alwaye of good chere and knowe well that as longe as we are at home in the body we are absent from God .
47005007	For we walke in fayth and se not .
47005008	Neverthelesse we are of good comforte and had lever to be absent from the body and to be present with the lorde .
47005009	Wherfore whether we be at home or from home we endeuoure oure selves to please him .
47005010	For we must all appere before the iudgement seate of Christ that every man maye receave the workes of his body accordynge to that he hath done whether it be good or bad ?
47005011	Seynge then that we knowe how the lorde is to be feared we fare fayre with men . For we are knowen wel ynough vnto God . I trust also that we are knowen in youre consciences .
47005012	We prayse not oure selves agayne vnto you but geve you an occasion to reioyce of vs that ye maye have some what agaynst the whych reioyce in the face and not in the hert .
47005013	For yf we be to fervent to God are we to fervent . Yf we kepe measure for youre cause kepe we measure .
47005014	For the love of Christ costrayneth vs be cause we thus iudge yf one be deed for all yt then are all deed
47005015	and that he dyed for all that they which live shuld not hence forth live vnto them selves but vnto hym whith died for them and rose agayne .
47005016	Wherfore henceforth knowe we no man after the flesshe . In somoche though we have knowe Christ after the flesshe now hence forthe knowe we hym so no more .
47005017	Therfore yf eny man be in Christ he is a newe creature . Olde thynges are passed awaye beholde all thinges are be come newe .
47005018	Neverthelesse all thinges are of god which hath reconciled vs vnto him sylfe by Iesus Christ and hath geven vnto vs the office to preach the atonement .
47005019	For god was in Christ and made agrement bitwene the worlde and hym sylfe and imputed not their synnes vnto them : and hath comitted to vs the preachynge of ye atonmet .
47005020	Now then are we messengers in the roume of Christ : even as though God did beseche you thorow vs : So praye we you in Christes stede that ye be atone with God :
47005021	for he hath made him to be synne for vs which knewe no synne that we by his meanes shuld be that rightewesnes which before God is aloved .
47006001	We as helpers therfore exhorte you yt ye receave not the grace of god in ( vayne )
47006002	For he saith : I have hearde the in a tyme accepted : and in ye daye of saluacion have I suckered the . Beholde now is that well accepted tyme : beholde now is yt daye of saluacion .
47006003	Let vs geve no man occasion of evyll that in oure office be founde no faute :
47006004	but in all thynges let vs behave oure selves as the ministers of God . In moche pacience in afflicios in necessite in anguysshe
47006005	in strypes in presonmet in stryfe in laboure in watchinge in fastyng
47006006	in purenes in knowledge in longe sufferynge in kyndnes in the holy goost in love vnfayned
47006007	in ye wordes of trueth in the power of God by ye armoure of rightewesnes on ye right honde and on the lyfte
47006008	in honoure and dishonoure in evyll reporte and good reporte as desceauers and yet true
47006009	as unknowen and yet knowen : as dyinge and beholde we yet live : as chastened and not killed :
47006010	as sorowynge and yet alwaye mery : as poore and yet make many ryche : as havynge nothynge and yet possessynge all thynges .
47006011	O ye Corinthyans oure mouth is open vnto you . Oure herte is made large :
47006012	ye are in no strayte in vs but are in a strayte in youre awne bowelles :
47006013	I promyse you lyke rewarde with me as to my childre .
47006014	Set youreselues therfore at large and beare not a straugers yoke wyth the vnbelevers . For what fellishippe hath rightewesnes with vnrightewesnes ? What company hath light wt darcknes ?
47006015	What cocorde hath Christ with beliall ? Ether what parte hath he yt beleveth with an infidele ?
47006016	how agreeth the temple of god wt ymages ? And ye are the temple of yt lyuynge god as sayde god . I will dwell amonge the and walke amoge the and wilbe their god : and they shalbe my people .
47006017	Wherfore come out from amoge the and separate youreselues ( sayth the lorde ) and touche none vncleane thynge : so wyll I receave you
47006018	and wilbe a father vnto you and ye shalbe vnto me sonnes and doughters sayth the lorde almyghty .
47007001	Seynge that we have soche promeses derely beloved let vs clense oure selves from all fylthynes of the flesshe and sprete and growe vp to full holynes in ye feare of God .
47007002	Vnderstonde vs . we have hurte no man : we have corrupte no man : we have defrauded no man .
47007003	I speake not this to condempne you : for I have shewed you before yt ye are in oure hertes to dye and live with you .
47007004	I am very bolde over you and reioyce greatly in you . I am filled with comforte and am excadinge ioyouse in all oure tribulacions .
47007005	For when we were come into Macedonia oure flesshe had no rest but we were troubled on every syde . Outwarde was fightynge inwarde was feare .
47007006	Neverthelesse God that comfortith the abiecte comforted vs at the commynge of Titus .
47007007	And not with his commynge only : but also with the consolacion wherwith he was comforted of you . For he tolde vs youre desyre youre mornynge youre fervent mynde to me warde : so that I now reioyce the more .
47007008	Wherfore though I made you sory with a letter I repent not : though I did repent . For I perceave that ye same pistle made you sory though it were but for a ceason .
47007009	But I now reioyce not that ye were sory but that ye so sorowed that ye repented . For ye sorowed godly : so yt in nothynge ye were hurte by vs .
47007010	For godly sorowe causeth repentaunce vnto salvacion not to be repented of : when worldly sorow causeth deeth .
47007011	Beholde what diligence this godly sorowe that ye toke hath wrought in you : yee it caused you to cleare youre selves . It caused indignacion it caused feare yt caused desyre it caused a fervent mynde it caused punysshment . For in all thynges ye have shewed youreselues that ye were cleare in that matter .
47007012	Wherfore though I wrote vnto you I did it not for his cause that did hurte nether for his cause that was hurte : but that oure good mynde whych we have towarde you in the sight of god myght appere vnto you .
47007013	Therfore we are comforted because ye are comforted : yee and excedyngly the moare ioyed we for the ioye that Titus had : because his sprete was refresshed of you all .
47007014	I a therfor not now ashamed though I bosted my sylfe to hym of you . For as all thynges which I preached vnto you are true even so is oure bostynge that I bosted my silfe to Titus wt all founde true .
47007015	And now is his inwarde affection more aboundant towarde you when he remembreth the obedience of every one of you : how with feare and trymblynge ye receaved hym .
47007016	I reioyce that I maye be bolde over you in all thynges .
47008001	I do you to wit brethren of the grace of god which is geven in the congregacions of Macedonia
47008002	how that the aboundaunce of their reioysing is that they are tried wt moche tribulacio . And therto though they were excedinge poore yet haue they geue excedinge richly and that in singlenesse .
47008003	For to their powers ( I beare recorde ) yee and beyonde their power they were willynge of their owne accorde
47008004	and prayed vs with great instaunce that we wolde receave their benefite and suffre them to be parttakers with other in ministrynge to the saynctes .
47008005	And this they did not as we loked for : but gave their awne selves fyrst to the lorde and after vnto vs by the will of God :
47008006	so that we coulde not but desyre Titus to acomplysshe the same benivolence amonge you also even as he had begonne .
47008007	Now therfore as ye are ryche in all parties in fayth in worde in knowledge in all fervetnes and in love which ye have to vs : even so se that ye be plenteons in this benivolence .
47008008	Thys saye I not as commaundynge : but be cause other are so fervent therfore prove I youre love whether it be perfait or no .
47008009	Ye knowe the liberalitie of oure lorde Iesus Christ which though he were riche yet for youre sakes be came poore : that ye thorow his povertie myght be made ryche .
47008010	And I geve counsell hereto . For this is expedient for you which beganne not to do only : but also to will a yeare a goo .
47008011	Now therfore performe the dede : that as ther was in you a redines to will even so ye maye performe the dede of that which ye have .
47008012	For if ther be fyrst a willynge mynde it is accepted accordynge to that a man hath and not accordinge to that he hath not .
47008013	It is not my mynde that other be set at ease and ye brought into combraunce :
47008014	but that ther be egalnes now at this tyme that youre aboundaunce sucker their lacke : that their aboundaunce maye supplie youre lacke :
47008015	that ther maye be equalite agreynge to that which is written . He that gaddered moche had never the more aboundaunce and he yt gaddered lytell had never the lesse .
47008016	Thankes be vnto god which put in ye hert of Titus the same good mynde toward you .
47008017	For he accepted ye request yee rather he was so well willynge that of his awne accorde came vnto you .
47008018	We haue sent with him that brother whose laude is in the gospell thorow out all the congregacions :
47008019	and not so only but is also chosen of the congregacions to be a felowe with vs in oure iorney concerninge this benivolence that is ministred by vs vnto the prayse of ye lorde and to stere vp youre prompt mynde .
47008020	For thys we eschue that eny man shuld rebuke vs in this plenteous distribucion that is ministred by vs
47008021	and therfore make provision for honest thynges not in the sight of god only but also in the sight of men .
47008022	We have sent with them a brother of oures whom we have ofte tymes proved diliget in many thynges but now moche more diligent . The great confidence which I have in you .
47008023	hath caused me this to do : partly for Titus sake which is my felowe and helper as cocernynge you partly because of other which are oure brethren and the messengers of the congregacios and ye glory of Christ .
47008024	Wherfore shewe vnto them the proffe of youre love and of the reioysynge that we have of you that ye congregacions maye se it .
47009001	Of the ministrynge to ye saynctes it is but superfluous for me to write vnto you :
47009002	for I knowe youre redynes of mide wherof I bost my silfe vnto them of Macedonia and saye that Achaia was prepared a yeare a goo and youre ferventnes hath provoked many .
47009003	Never thelesse yet have I sent these brethren lest oure reioysynge over you shuld be in vayne in this behalfe and that ye ( as I have sayd ) preparare youre selues
47009004	lest paraveture yf they of Macedonia come with me and fynde you vnprepared the boost that I made in this matter shuld be a shame to vs : I saye not vnto you .
47009005	Wherfore I thought it necessary to exhorte the brethren to come before hode vnto you forto prepare youre good blessynge promysed afore that it myght be redy : so yt it be a blessynge and not a defraudynge .
47009006	This yet remember howe that he which soweth lytell shall reepe lytell : and he yt soweth plenteously shall reepe plenteously .
47009007	And let every man do accordynge as he hath purposed in his herte not groudgyngly or of necessite . For god loveth a chearfull gever .
47009008	God is able to make you ryche in all grace that ye in all thynges havynge sufficiet vnto the vttmoste maye be ryche vnto all manner good workes
47009009	as it is written : He yt sparsed abroade and hath geven to the povre his rightewesnes remayneth for ever .
47009010	He yt fyndeth the sower seed shall minister breed for fode and shall multiplie youre seed and increace the frutes of youre rightewesnes
47009011	that on all parties ye maye be made ryche in all synglenes which causeth thorowe vs thankes gevynge vnto god .
47009012	For the office of this ministracion not only supplieth the nede of the sayntes : but also is aboundaunt herein that for this laudable ministrynge thankes myght be geven to god
47009013	of many whiche prayse god for the obedience of youre professynge ye gospell of Christ and for youre synglenes in distributynge to them and to all me :
47009014	and in their prayers to God for you longe after you for the aboundauut grace of God geven vnto you .
47009015	Thankes be vnto God for his vn speakeable gyft .
47010001	I Paule my silfe beseche you by the mekenes and softnes of Christ which when I am present amoge you am of no reputacio but am bolde towarde you beinge absent .
47010002	I besech you that I nede not to be bolde when I am present ( with that same confidece wher with I am supposed to be bolde ) agaynst some which repute vs as though we walked carnally .
47010003	Neverthelesse though we walke compased with ye fleshe yet we warre not flesshlye
47010004	For the weapes of oure warre are not carnall thinges but thynges myghty in god to cast doune stronge holdes
47010005	wherwith we overthrowe ymaginacyons and every hye thynge that exalteh it silfe agaynst the knowledge of god and brynge into captivite all vnderstondynge to the obedience of Christ
47010006	and are redy to take vengeaunce on all disobedience when youre obedience is fulfilled .
47010007	Loke ye on thynges after ye vtter apparence ? Yf eny man trust in him silfe yt he is Christis let the same also considre of him silfe yt as he is Christis even so are we Christes .
47010008	And though I shuld bost my silfe somewhat moare of oure auctorite which the lorde hath geven vs to edifie and not to destroye you it shulde not be to my shame .
47010009	This saye I lest I shuld seme as though I went about to make you a frayde with letters .
47010010	For ye pistles ( sayth he ) are sore and stronge : but his bodyly presence is weake and his speache rude .
47010011	Let him yt is soche thynke on this wyse that as we are in wordes by letters when we are absent soche are we in dedes when we are present .
47010012	For we cannot fynde in oure hertes to make oure selves of ye nombre of them or to compare oure selves to them which laude the selves neuerthelesse whill they measure the selves wt them selves and copare the selves wt the selves they vnderstode nought .
47010013	But we wyll not reioyce above measure : but accordynge to the quantitie of ye measure which god hath distributed vnto vs a measure that reacheth even vnto you .
47010014	For we stretche uot out oure selves beyode measure as though we had not reached vnto you . For even vnto you have we come with the gospell of Christ
47010015	and we bost not oure selves out of measure in other mens labours . Ye and we hope when youre fayth is increased amoge you to be magnified acordynge to oure measure more largely
47010016	and to preache ye gospell in those regions which are beyode you : and not to reioyce of that which is by another mans measure prepared all redy .
47010017	Let him yt reioyseth reioyce in the lorde .
47010018	For he that prayseth him silfe is not alowed : but he whom the lorde prayseth .
47011001	Wolde to god ye coulde suffre me a lytell in my folysshnes : yee and I praye you forbeare me .
47011002	For I am gelous over you with godly gelousy . For I coupled you to one man to make you a chaste virgen to Christ .
47011003	But I feare lest as the serpent begyled Eve thorow his sutteltie even so youre wittes shuld be corrupte from the singlenes that is in Christ .
47011004	For if he that commeth preache another Iesus then hym whom we preached : or if ye receave another sprete then that which ye have receaved : other another gospell then that ye have receaved ye myght right wel have bene content .
47011005	I suppose that I was not behynde ye chefe apostles .
47011006	Though I be rude in speakynge yet I am not so in knowledge . How be it amonge you we are knowen to the vtmost what we are in all thynges .
47011007	Did I therin synne be cause I submitted my silfe that ye myght be exalted and because I preached to you the gospell of God fre ?
47011008	I robbed other congregacions and toke wages of the to do you service with all .
47011009	And when I was present with yov and had nede I was greuous to no man for that which was lackynge vnto me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied : and in all thynges I kept my silfe that I shuld not be greveous to you : and so will I kepe my silfe .
47011010	Yf the trueth of Christ be in me this ieioysynge shall not be taken from me in the regions of Achaia .
47011011	Wherfore ? Be cause I love you not ? God knoweth .
47011012	Neverthe lesse what I doo that will I do to cut awaye occasion from them which desyre occasion that they myght be founde lyke vnto vs in that wherin they reioyce .
47011013	For these falce apostles are disceatefull workers and fassion them selves lyke vnto ye apostles of Christ .
47011014	And no marvayle for satan him silfe is chaunged into the fassion of an angell of light .
47011015	Therfore it is no great thynge though his ministers fassion them selves as though they were the ministers of rightewesnes : whose ende shalbe acordynge to their dedes .
47011016	I saye agayne lest eny man thynke yt I am folishe : or els eve now take me as a fole that I maye bost my silfe a lytell .
47011017	That I speake I speake it not after the wayes of the lorde : but as it were folysshly whill we are now come to bostynge .
47011018	Seynge that many reioyce after ye flesshe I will reioyce also .
47011019	For ye suffre foles gladly be cause that ye youre selves are wyse .
47011020	For ye suffre even if a man brynge you into bondage : yf a ma devoure : yf a man take : yf a man exalt hym silfe : yf a man smyte you on the face .
47011021	I speake as concernynge rebuke as though we had bene weake . How be it wherin soever eny man dare be bolde ( I speake folisshly ) I dare be bolde also
47011022	They are Ebrues so am I : They are Israelites eve so am I . They are ye seede of Abraha even so am I .
47011023	They are ye ministers of Christ ( I speake as a fole ) I am moare : In labours moare aboundat : In strypes above measure : In preson more plenteously : In deeth ofte .
47011024	Of the Iewes five tymes receaved I every tyme . xl . strypes saue one .
47011025	Thryse was I beten with roddes . I was once stoned . I suffered thryse shipwracke . Nyght and daye have I bene in the depe of the see .
47011026	In iorneyinge often : In parels of waters : In parels of robbers : In ieoperdies of myne awne nacion : In ieoperdies amoge the hethen . I have bene in parels in cities in parels in wildernes in parels in the see in parels amonge falce brethren
47011027	in laboure and travayle in watchynge often in honger in thirst in fastynges often in colde and in nakednes .
47011028	And besyde the thynges which outwardly happe vnto me I am cobred dayly and do care for all congregacions .
47011029	Who is sicke and I am not sicke ? Who is hurte in the fayth and my hert burneth not ?
47011030	Yf I must nedes reioyce I will reioyce of myne infirmities .
47011031	The God and father of oure lorde Iesus Christ which is blessed for evermore knoweth that I lye not
47011032	In ye citie of Damascon the governer of ye people vnder kynge Aretas layde watche in ye citie of the Damasces and wolde have caught me
47011033	and at a wyndowe was I let doune in a basket thorowe the wall and so scaped his hondes .
47012001	It is not expediet for me ( no dout to reioyce . Neverthelesse I will come to visions and revelacios of ye lorde .
47012002	I knowe a ma in Christ above . xiiij . yeares agone ( whether he weare in ye body I cannot tell or whether he were oute of ye body I canot tell god knoweth ) which was take vp into the thyrd heven .
47012003	And I knowe the same man ( whether in the body or out of the body I canot tell god knoweth )
47012004	howe yt he was take vp into paradise and hearde wordes not to be spoke which no man can vtter .
47012005	Of this man will I reioyce of my silfe will I not reioyce except it be of myne infirmities .
47012006	And yet though I wolde reioyce I shuld not be a fole : for I wolde saye the trouthe . Neverthe lesse I spare lest eny man shuld thynke of me above that he seith me to be or heareth of me .
47012007	And lest I shuld be exalted out of measure thorow the aboundance of revelacions ther was geven vnto me vnquyetnes of the flesshe the messenger of Satan to buffet me : be cause I shuld not be exalted out of measure
47012008	For this thynge besought I the lorde thryse that it myght departe from me .
47012009	And he sayde vnto me : my grace is sufficient for the . For my stregth is made perfact thorow weaknes . Very gladly therfore will I reioyce of my weaknes that the strength of Christ maye dwell in me
47012010	Therfore have I delectacion in infirmities in rebukes in nede in persecucions in anguyshe for Christis sake . For when I am weake then am I stronge .
47012011	I am made a fole in bostynge my silfe . Ye have copelled me : I ought to have bene comeded of you . For in nothinge was I inferior vnto ye chefe apostels Though I be nothynge
47012012	yet ye tokes of an apostle were wrought amoge you with all pacience : with signes and wonders and myghty dedes .
47012013	For what is it wherin ye were inferiors vnto other cogregacions except it be therin that I was not greveous vnto you . Forgeve me this wronge done vnto you .
47012014	Beholde now ye thyrde tyme I am redy to come vnto you : and yet will I not be grevous vnto you . For I seke not youres but you . Also the children ought not to laye vp for the fathers and mothers : but the fathers and mothers for the children .
47012015	I will very gladly bestowe and wilbe bestowed for youre soules : though the moare I love you ye lesse I am loved agayne .
47012016	But be it yt I greved you not : never the lesse I was crafty and toke you with gile .
47012017	Did I pill you by eny of the which I sent vnto you ?
47012018	I desyred Titus and wt him I sent a brother . Did Titus defraude you of eny thynge ? walked we not in one sprete ? walked we not in lyke steppes ?
47012019	Agayne thynke ye yt we excuse oure selves ? We speake in Christ in the sight of God . But we do all thynges dearly beloved for youre edifyinge .
47012020	For I feare lest it come to passe that when I come I shall not fynde you soche as I wolde : and I shalbe foude vnto you soche as ye wolde not : I feare lest ther be founde amoge you debate envyinge wrath stryfe backbytynges whisperynges swellynges and discorde .
47012021	I feare lest when I come agayne God brynge me lowe amoge you and I be constrayned to bewayle many of the which have synned all redy and have not repented of the vnclennes fornicacion and wantanes which they haue committed .
47013001	Now come I the thyrd tyme vnto you In the mouth of two or thre witnesses shall every thinge stonde .
47013002	I tolde you before and tell you before : and as I sayde whe I was present with you the seconde tyme so wryte I now beynge absent to them which in tyme past have synned and to all other : yt if I come agayne I will not spare
47013003	seynge yt ye seke experience of Christ which speaketh in me which amoge you is not weake but is myghty in you .
47013004	And verely though it came of weaknes that he was crucified yet liveth he thorow the power of God . And we no dout are weake in him : but we shall live with him by the myght of God amonge you .
47013005	Prove youre selves whether ye are in the fayth or not . Examen youre owne selves : knowe ye not youre awne selves how that Iesus Christ is in you excepte ye be castawayes ?
47013006	I trust that ye shall knowe yt we are not castawayes .
47013007	I desyre before God that ye do none evyll not that we shuld seme comendable : but that ye shuld do that which is honest : and let vs be counted as leawde persones .
47013008	We can do no thinge agaynst the trueth but for the trueth .
47013009	We are glad when we are weake and ye stronge . This also we wisshe for even that ye were perfect .
47013010	Therfore write I these thinges beynge absent lest when I am present I shuld vse sharpenes accordinge to the power which the Lorde hath geven me to edifie and not to destroye .
47013011	Finallye brethren fare ye well be perfect be of good comforte be of one mynde lyve in peace and the God of love and peace shalbe with you .
47013012	Grete one another in an holy kysse .
47013013	All ye saynctes salute you .
47013014	The grace of oure Lorde Iesus Christ and the love of God and the fellishippe of the holy goost be with you all . Ame
48001001	Paul an Apostle not of men nether by man but by Iesus Christ and by God the father which raysed him from deeth :
48001002	and all the brethren which are with me . Vnto the congregacios of Galacia .
48001003	Grace be with you and peace from God the father and from oure Lorde Iesus Christ
48001004	which gave him selfe for oure synnes to deliver vs from this present evyll worlde thorow the will of God oure father
48001005	to whom be prayse for ever and ever . Amen .
48001006	I marvayle that ye are so sone turned fro him that called you in the grace of Christ vnto another gospell :
48001007	which is nothinge els but that ther be some which trouble you and intende to pervert to gospell of Christ .
48001008	Neverthelesse though we oure selves or an angell fro heve preache eny other gospell vnto you the that which we have preached vnto you holde him as a cursed .
48001009	As I sayde before so saye I now agayne yf eny man preache eny other thinge vnto you then that ye have receaved holde him accursed .
48001010	Preache I mannes doctrine or Godes ? Ether go I about to please men ? If I stodyed to please men I were not the servaunt of Christ .
48001011	I certifie you brethren that the gospell which was preached of me was not after the maner of men
48001012	nether receaved I it of ma nether was I taught it : but receaved it by the revelacion of Iesus Christ .
48001013	For ye have hearde of my conversacion in tyme past in the Iewes wayes how that beyonde measure I persecuted the congregacion of God and spoyled it :
48001014	and prevayled in the Iewes laye above many of my companions which were of myne awne nacio and was a moche more fervet mayntener of the tradicions of the elders .
48001015	But whe it pleased God which seperated me from my mothers wombe and called me by his grace
48001016	forto declare his sonne by me that I shuld preache him amonge the hethen : immediatly I comened not of the matter with flesshe and bloud
48001017	nether returned to Ierusalem to them which were Apostles before me : but wet my wayes into Arabia and came agayne vnto Damasco .
48001018	Then after thre yeare I returned to Ierusalem to se Peter and abode with him . xv . dayes
48001019	no nother of the Apostles sawe I save Iames the Lordes brother .
48001020	The thinges which I write beholde God knoweth I lye not .
48001021	After that I went into the costes of Siria and Cilicia :
48001022	and was vnknowen as touchinge my person vnto ye cogregacios of Iewrye which were in Christ .
48001023	But they hearde only that he which persecuted vs in tyme past now preacheth the fayth which before he destroyed .
48001024	And they glorified God on my behalffe .
48002001	Then . xiiii . yeares after that I wet vp agayne to Ierusalem with Barnabas and toke with me Titus also .
48002002	Ye and I went vp by revelacion and comened with them of the Gospell which I preache amonge the gentyls : but apart with them which were couted chefe lest it shuld have bene thought yt I shuld runne or had runne in vayne .
48002003	Also Titus which was with me though he were a Greke yet was not compelled to be circumcised
48002004	and that because of incomers beynge falce brethren which came in amoge other to spye out oure libertie which we have in Christ Iesus that they might bringe vs into bondage .
48002005	To whom we gave no roume no not for the space of an houre as cocerninge to be brought into subieccio : and that because that the trueth of the gospell myght continue with you .
48002006	Of the which seme to be great ( what they were in tyme passed it maketh no matter to me : God loketh on no mans person ) neverthelesse they which seme great added nothynge to me .
48002007	But contrary wyse when they sawe that the gospell over the vncircumcision was comitted vnto me as the gospell over ye circucision was vnto Peter :
48002008	for he yt was myghty in Peter in the Apostleshippe over the circumcision the same was myghty in me amoge the gentyls :
48002009	and therfore when they perceaved the grace that was geve vnto me then Iames Cephas and Iohn which semed to be pilers gave to me and Barnabas the ryght hondes and agreed with vs that we shuld preache amonge the Hethen and they amonge the Iewes :
48002010	warnynge only that we shulde remember the poore . Which thinge also I was diligent to do .
48002011	And when Peter was come to Antioche I withstode him in the face for he was worthy to be blamed .
48002012	For yerr that certayne came fro Iames he ate with the gentyls . But when they were come he withdrue and separated him selfe fearinge them which were of ye circumcision .
48002013	And ye other Iewes dissembled lyke wyse in so moche that Barnabas was brought into their simulacio also .
48002014	But when I sawe that they went not the ryght waye after the trueth of the gospell I sayde vnto Peter before all men yf thou beynge a Iewe livest after the maner of the gentyls and not as do the Iewes : why causest thou the getyls to live as do the Iewes ?
48002015	We which are Iewes by nature and not synners of the getyls
48002016	knowe that a man is not iustified by ye dedes of the lowe : but by the fayth of Iesus Christ . And therfore we have beleved on Iesus Christ yt we myght be iustified by ye fayth of Christ and uot by the dedes of the lawe : because that by ye dedes of ye lawe no flesshe shalbe iustified .
48002017	Yf then whill we seke to be made rightewes by Christ we oure selves are founde synners is not then Christ ye minister of synne ? God forbyd .
48002018	For yf I bylde agayne yt which I destroyed . then make I my selfe a treaspaser .
48002019	But I thorow ye lawe ame deed to ye lawe : that I myght live vnto God .
48002020	I am crucified with Christ . I live verely : yet now not I but Christ liveth in me . For ye lyfe which I now live in ye flesshe I live by the fayth of ye sonne of God which loved me and gave him selne for me .
48002021	I despyse not the grace of God . For if rightewesnes come of the lawe then Christ dyed in vayne .
48003001	O folisshe Galathyas : who hath bewitched you that ye shuld not beleve the trueth ? To whom Iesus Christ was described before the eyes and amoge you crucified .
48003002	This only wolde I learne of you : receaved ye the sprete by the dedes of ye lawe or els by preachinge of ye faith ?
48003003	Are ye so vnwyse that after ye have begonne in the sprete ye wolde nowe ende in the flesshe ?
48003004	So many thinges there ye have suffred in vayne if yt be vayne .
48003005	Which ministered to you the sprete and worketh myracles amonge you doth he it thorow the dedes of the lawe or by preachinge of the fayth ?
48003006	Even as Abraham beleved God and it was asscribed to him for rightewesnes .
48003007	Vnderstonde therfore yt they which are of fayth the same are the chyldren of Abraham .
48003008	For the seripture sawe afore honde yt God wolde iustifie the hethen thorow fayth and therfore shewed before honde glad tydinges vnto Abraham : In the shall all nacions be blessed .
48003009	So then they which be of fayth are blessed with faythfull Abraham .
48003010	For as many as are vnder the dedes of the lawe are vnder malediccio . For it is written : cursed is every man yt cotinueth not in all thinges which are writte in ye boke of ye lawe to fulfill the .
48003011	That no ma is iustified by ye lawe in ye sight of God is evidet . For the iuste shall live by fayth .
48003012	The lawe is not of fayth : but the man that fulfilleth the thinges contayned in the lawe ( shall live in the . )
48003013	But Christ hath delivered vs fro the curse of the lawe and was made a cursed for vs . For it is writte : cursed is every one that hangeth on tree
48003014	that the blessynge of Abraham might come on the getyls thorow Iesus Christ and that we might receave the promes of the sprete thorow fayth .
48003015	Brethren I will speake after the maner of men . Though it be but a mans testament yet no ma despiseth it or addeth eny thinge therto when it is once alowed .
48003016	To Abraham and his seed were the promises made . He sayth not in the seedes as in many : but in thy sede as in one which is Christ .
48003017	This I saye that the lawe which beganne afterwarde beyonde . iiii . C and . xxx . yeares doth not disanull the testament that was confermed afore of God vnto Christ ward to make the promes of none effect .
48003018	For yf the inheritaunce come of the lawe it cometh not of promes . But God gave it vnto Abraham by promes .
48003019	Wherfore then serveth ye lawe ? The lawe was added because of transgression ( tyll the seed cam to which ye promes was made ) and it was ordeyned by angels in ye honde of a mediator .
48003020	A mediator is not a mediator of one . But God is one .
48003021	Ys the lawe then agaynst ye promes of God ? God forbid . How be it yf ther had bene a lawe geve which coulde have geven lyfe : then no doute rightewesnes shuld have come by ye lawe .
48003022	But ye scripture concluded all thinges vnder synne yt the promes by the fayth of Iesus Christ shuld be geve vnto them yt beleve .
48003023	Before yt fayth cam we were kept and shut vp vnder the lawe vnto the fayth which shuld afterwarde be declared .
48003024	Wherfore the lawe was oure scolemaster vnto the tyme of Christ yt we might be made rightewes by fayth .
48003025	But after yt fayth is come now are we no lenger vnder a scolemaster .
48003026	For ye are all the sonnes of God by ye fayth which is in Christ Iesus .
48003027	For all ye that are baptised have put on Christ .
48003028	Now is ther no Iewe nether getyle : ther is nether bonde ner fre : ther is nether man ner woman : but ye are all one thinge in Christ Iesu .
48003029	Yf ye be Christes then are ye Abrahams seed and heyres by promes .
48004001	And I saye that the heyre as longe as he is a chylde differth not from a servaunt though he be Lorde of all
48004002	but is vnder tuters and governers vntill the tyme appoynted of the father .
48004003	Even so we as longe as we were chyldren were in bondage vnder the ordinaunces of the worlde .
48004004	But when the tyme was full come God sent his sonne borne of a woman and made bonde vnto ye lawe
48004005	to redeme the which were vnder the lawe : yt we thorow eleccion myght receave the inheritauce yt belongeth vnto the naturall sonnes .
48004006	Be cause ye are sonnes God hath sent the sprete of his sonne in to oure hertes which cryeth Abba father .
48004007	Wherfore now thou art not a servaunt but a sonne . Yf thou be ye sonne thou arte also the heyre of God thorow Christ .
48004008	Notwithstondinge whe ye knewe not God ye dyd service vnto them which by nature were no goddes .
48004009	But now seinge ye knowe god ( yee rather are knowe of God ) how is it that ye tourne agayne vnto the weake and bedgarly cerimonies whervnto agayne ye desyre afresshe to be in bondage ?
48004010	Ye observe dayes and monethes and tymes and yeares .
48004011	I am in feare of you lest I have bestowed on you laboure in vayne .
48004012	Brethern I besech you be ye as I am : for I am as ye are . Ye have not hurte me at all .
48004013	Ye knowe how thorow infirmite of the flesshe I preached the gospell vnto you at the fyrst .
48004014	And my temptacion which I suffered by reason of my flesshe ye despysed not nether abhorred : but receaved me as an angell of god : ye as Christ Iesus .
48004015	How happy were ye then ? for I beare you recorde that yf it had bene possible ye wolde have plucked out youre awne eyes and have geven them to me .
48004016	Am I therfore become youre enemie because I tell you the truth ?
48004017	They are gelous over you amysse . Ye they intede to exclude you that ye shuld be feruet to them warde .
48004018	It is good alwayes to be fervent so it be in a good thinge and not only whe I am present with you .
48004019	My littel children ( of whom I travayle in birth againe vntill Christ be fassioned in you )
48004020	I wolde I were with you now and coulde chaunge my voyce : for I stonde in a doute of you
48004021	Tell me ye that desyre to be vnder the lawe have ye not hearde of the lawe ?
48004022	For it is written that Abraham had two sonnes ye one by a bonde mayde the other by a fre woman .
48004023	Yee and he which was of the bonde woman was borne after the flesshe : but he which was of the fre woman was borne by promes .
48004024	Which thinges betoken mystery . For these wemen are two testamentes the one fro the mounte Sina which gendreth vnto bondage which is Agar .
48004025	For mounte Sina is called Agar in Arabia and bordreth vpo the citie which is now Ierusalem and is in bondage with her chyldren .
48004026	But Ierusalem which is above is fre : which is the mother of vs all .
48004027	For it is written : reioyce thou bare that bearest no chyldre : breake forthe and crye thou that travelest not . For the desolate hath many moo chyldren then she which hath an husband .
48004028	Brethre we are after the maner of Isaac chyldren of promes .
48004029	But as then he yt was borne carnally persecuted him that was borne spiritually . Even so is it now .
48004030	Neverthelesse what sayth the scripture : put awaye the bonde woman and her sonne . For the sonne of the bonde woma shall not be heyre with the sonne of ye fre woman .
48004031	So then brethren we are not chyldre of the bonde woman : but of the fre woman .
48005001	Stond fast therfore in ye libertie wher with Christ hath made vs fre and wrappe not youre selves agayne in ye yoke of bondage .
48005002	Beholde I Paul saye vnto you that yf ye be circumcised Christ shall proffit you nothinge at all .
48005003	I testifie agayne to every man which is circumcised that he is bounde to kepe the whole lawe .
48005004	Ye are gone quyte fro Christ as many as are iustified by the lawe and are fallen from grace .
48005005	We loke for and hope in the sprite to be iustified thorow fayth .
48005006	For in Iesu Christ nether is circumcision enythinge worth nether yet vncircocision but faith which by love is mighty in operacion .
48005007	Ye did runne well : who was a let vnto you that ye shuld not obey the trueth ?
48005008	Eve that counsell that is not of him that called you .
48005009	A lytell leven doth leven the whole lompe of dowe .
48005010	I have trust towarde you in the Lorde yt ye wyll be none other wyse mynded . He that troubleth you shall beare his iudgemet what soever he be .
48005011	Brethren yf I yet preache circucision : why do I then yet suffre persecucion ? For then had the offence which the crosse geveth ceased .
48005012	I wolde to God they were seperated from you which trouble you .
48005013	Brethre ye were called in to ( libertie ) only let not youre libertie be an occasion vnto the flesshe but in love serve one another .
48005014	For all ye lawe is fulfilled in one worde which is this : thou shalt love thyne neghbour as thy selfe .
48005015	Yf ye byte and devoure one another : take hede lest ye be consumed one of another .
48005016	I saye walke in the sprete and fulfill not ye lustes of ye flesshe .
48005017	For ye flesshe lusteth contrary to ye sprete and ye sprete cotrary to ye flesshe . Tese are cotrary one to the other so yt ye canot do that which ye wolde .
48005018	But and yf ye be ledde of the sprete then are ye not vnder the lawe .
48005019	The dedes of the flesshe are manyfest whiche are these advoutrie fornicacio vnclenes wantannes
48005020	ydolatrye witchecraft hatred variaunce zele wrath stryfe sedicion sectes
48005021	envyinge murther dronkenes glottony and soche lyke : of the which I tell you before as I have tolde you in tyme past that they which comit soche thinges shall not inherite ye kyngdome of God .
48005022	But ye frute of sprete is loue ioye peace longesufferinge getlenes goodnes faythfulnes
48005023	meknes temperancye . Agaynst suche ther is no lawe .
48005024	They ye are Christis have crucified the flesshe with the appetites and lustes
48005025	Yf we lyve in the sprete let vs walke in the sprete .
48005026	Let vs not be vayne glorious provokinge one another and envyinge one another .
48006001	Brethren yf eny ma be fallen by chauce into eny faute : ye which are spirituall helpe to amende him in the sprete of meknes : consyderynge thy silfe lest thou also be tempted .
48006002	Beare ye one anothers burthe and so fulfill the lawe of Christ .
48006003	If eny ma seme to him silfe that he is somwhat whe in dede he is nothynge the same deceaveth hym silfe in his ymaginacion .
48006004	Let every man prove his awne worke and then shall he have reioysinge in his awne silfe and not in another
48006005	For every man shall beare his awne burthen .
48006006	Let him that is taught in ye worde minister vnto him yt teacheth him in all good thinges .
48006007	Be not deceaved God is not mocked . For what soever a man soweth yt shall he reepe .
48006008	He that soweth in his flesshe shall of ye flesshe reepe corrupcio . But he yt soweth in ye sprete shall of the sprete reepe lyfe everlastinge .
48006009	Let vs not be wery of well doynge . For when the tyme is come we shall repe with out werines .
48006010	Whill we have therfore tyme let vs do good vnto all men and specially vnto them which are of the housholde of fayth .
48006011	Beholde how large a letter I have written vnto you with myne awne honde .
48006012	As many as desyre with vtwarde apperauce to please carnally they constrayne you to be circumcised only be cause they wolde not suffre persecucion with the crosse of Christ .
48006013	For they them selves which are circumcised kepe not the lawe : but desyre to have you circumcised that they myght reioyce in youre flesshe .
48006014	God forbyd that I shuld reioyce but in the crosse of oure Lorde Iesu Christ wherby the worlde is crucified as touchinge me and I as concerninge the worlde .
48006015	For in Christ Iesu nether circucision avayleth eny thinge at all nor vncircumcisio : but a new creature .
48006016	And as many as walke accordinge to this rule peace be on them and mercy and vpon Israel that pertayneth to God .
48006017	From hence forth let no man put me to busynes . For I beare in my bodye ye markes of the Lorde Iesu .
48006018	Brethren the grace of oure Lorde Iesu Christe be with youre sprete . Amen .
49001001	Paul an Apostle of Iesu Christ by the will of God . To the saynctes which are at Ephesus and to them which beleve on Iesus Christ .
49001002	Grace be with you and peace from God oure father and from the Lorde Iesus Christ .
49001003	Blessed be God the father of oure lorde Iesus Christ which hath blessed vs with all maner of spirituall blessinges in hevely thynges by Chryst
49001004	accordynge as he had chosen vs in him before ye foudacio of ye worlde was layde that we shuld be saintes and without blame before him thorow loue .
49001005	And ordeyned vs before thorow Iesus Christ to be heyres vnto him silfe accordinge to the pleasure of his will
49001006	to ye prayse of the glorie of his grace where with he hath made vs accepted in the beloved .
49001007	By whom we have redemption thorow his bloude euen the forgevenes of synnes accordynge to the riches of his grace
49001008	which grace he shed on vs aboundantly in all wisdome and perceavaunce .
49001009	And hath openned vnto vs the mistery of his will accordinge to his pleasure and purposed the same in hym silfe
49001010	to have it declared when the tyme were full come yt all thynges bothe ye thynges which are in heven and also the thynges which are in erthe shuld be gaddered togedder even in Christ :
49001011	that is to saye in him in whom we are made heyres and were therto predestinate accordynge to the purpose of him which worketh all thinges after the purpose of his awne will :
49001012	that we which before beleved in Christ shuld be vnto the prayse of his glory .
49001013	In whom also ye ( after that ye hearde the worde of trueth I meane the gospell of youre saluacio wherin ye beleved ) were sealed with the holy sprete of promes
49001014	which is the ernest of oure inheritaunce to redeme the purchased possession and that vnto the laude of his glory .
49001015	Wherfore even I ( after that I hearde of the fayth which ye have in the lorde Iesu and love vnto all the saynctes )
49001016	cease not to geve thankes for you makynge mencion of you in my prayers
49001017	that ye God of oure lorde Iesus Christ and the father of glory myght geve vnto you the sprete of wisdome and open to you the knowledge of him silfe
49001018	and lighten the eyes of youre myndes yt ye myght knowe what that hope is where vnto he hath called you and what the riches of his glorious inheritaunce is apon the sainctes
49001019	and what is the excedynge greatnes of his power to vs warde which beleve accordynge to the workynge of that his mighty power
49001020	which he wrought in Christ when he raysed him from deeth and set him on his right honde in hevenly thynges
49001021	above all rule power and myght and dominacion and above all names that are named not in this worlde only but also in the worlde to come :
49001022	and hath put all thynges vnder his fete and hath made him aboue all thynges ye heed of ye congregacion
49001023	which is his body and the fulnes of him that filleth all in all thynges .
49002001	And hath quickened you also that were deed in treaspasse and synne
49002002	in ye which in tyme passed ye walked acordynge to the course of this worlde and after the governer that ruleth in the ayer the sprete yt now worketh in the children of vnbelefe
49002003	amonge which we also had oure conversacion in tyme past in the lustes of oure flesshe and fullfilled the will of the flesshe and of the mynde : and were naturally the children of wrath even as wel as other .
49002004	But God which is rich in mercy thorow his greate love wherwith he loved vs
49002005	even when we were deed by synne hath quickened vs together in Christ ( for by grace are ye saved )
49002006	and hath raysed vs vp together and made vs sitte together in hevenly thynges thorow Christ Iesus
49002007	for to shewe in tymes to come the excedynge ryches of his grace in kyndnes to vs warde in Christ Iesu .
49002008	For by grace are ye made safe thorowe fayth and that not of youre selves . For it is the gyfte of God
49002009	and commeth not of workes lest eny man shuld bost him silfe .
49002010	For we are his worckmanshippe created in Christ Iesu vnto good workes vnto the which god ordeyned vs before that we shuld walke in them .
49002011	Wherfore remeber yt ye beynge in tyme passed getyls in ye flesshe and were called vncircucision to the which are called circucisio in the flesshe which circucision is made by hondes :
49002012	Remeber I saye yt ye were at that tyme wt oute Christ and were reputed aliantes from the comen welth of Israel and were straugers fro the testamentes of promes and had no hope and were with out god in this worlde .
49002013	But now in Christ Iesu ye which a whyle agoo were farre of are made nye by ye bloude of Christ .
49002014	For he is oure peace whych hath made of both one and hath broken doune the wall yt was a stoppe bitwene vs
49002015	and hath also put awaye thorow his flesshe the cause of hatred ( that is to saye the lawe of commaundementes contayned in the lawe written ) for to make of twayne one newe ma in him silfe so makynge peace :
49002016	and to recocile both vnto god in one body thorow his crosse and slewe hatred therby :
49002017	and came and preached peace to you which were afarre of and to them that were nye .
49002018	For thorow him we both have an open waye in in one sprete vnto the father .
49002019	Now therfore ye are no moare straugers and foreners : but citesyns with the saynctes and of the housholde of god :
49002020	and are bilt apon the foundacion of the apostles and prophetes Iesus Christ beynge the heed corner stone
49002021	in whom every bildynge coupled togedder groweth vnto an holy temple in ye lorde
49002022	in who ye also are bilt togedder and made an habitacio for god in the sprete .
49003001	For this cause I Paul a in ye bodes of Iesus christ for youre sakes which are hethen :
49003002	Yf ye have hearde of the ministracion of the grace of god which is geven me to you warde .
49003003	For by revelacion shewed he this mistery vnto me as I wrote above in feawe wordes
49003004	wher by when ye rede ye maye knowe myne vnderstondynge in the mistery of Christ
49003005	which mistery in tymes passed was not opened vnto the sonnes of men as it is nowe declared vnto his holy apostles and prophetes by the sprete :
49003006	that the gentyls shuld be inheritours also and of the same body and partakers of his promis yt is in Christ by ye meanes of the gospell
49003007	whereof I am made a minister by the gyfte of the grace of god geve vnto me thorow ye workynge of his power .
49003008	Vnto me the lest of all sayntes is this grace geven that I shuld preache amonge the gentyls the unsearchable ryches of Christ
49003009	and to make all men se what the felyshippe of the mistery is which from the begynnynge of the worlde hath bene hid in God which made all thynges thorow Iesus Christ
49003010	to the intent that now vnto the rulars and powers in heven myght be knowe by the cogregacion ye many folde wisdome of god
49003011	accordinge to ye eternall purpose which he purposed in Christ Iesu oure lorde
49003012	by who we are bolde to drawe nye in ye trust which we have by faith on hi
49003013	Wherfore I desire yt ye faynt not because of my trybulacios for youre sakes : which is youre prayse .
49003014	For this cause I bowe my knees vnto the father of oure lorde Iesus Christ
49003015	which is father over all that ys called father In heven and in erth
49003016	that he wolde graunt you acordynge to the ryches of his glory that ye maye be strenghted with myght by his sprete in the inner man
49003017	yt Christ maye dwell in youre hertes by fayth yt ye beynge roted and grounded in loue
49003018	myght be able to comprehende with all sayntes what ys that bredth aud length deepth and heyth :
49003019	and to knowe what is the love of Christ which love passeth knowledge : that ye might be fulfilled with all manner of fulnes which commeth of God .
49003020	Vnto him that is able to do excedynge aboudantly above all that we axe or thynke accordynge to the power that worketh in vs
49003021	be prayse in the congregacion by Iesus Christ thorow out all generacios from tyme to tyme Amen .
49004001	I therfore which am in bondes for the lordes sake exhorte you that ye walke worthy of the vocacion wherwith ye are called
49004002	in all humblenes of mynde and meknes and longe sufferynge forbearinge one another thorowe love
49004003	and that ye be dyliget to kepe ye vnitie of ye sprete in the bonde of peace
49004004	beynge one body and one sprete eve as ye are called in one hope of youre callynge .
49004005	Let ther be but one lorde one fayth one baptim :
49004006	one god and father of all which is above all thorow all and in you all .
49004007	Vnto every one of vs is geven grace acordinge to the measure of ye gyft of christ .
49004008	Wherfore he sayth : He is gone vp an hye and hath ledde captivitie captive and hath geven gyftes vnto men .
49004009	That he ascended : what meaneth it but that he also descended fyrst into the lowest parties of the erth ?
49004010	He that descended is even the same also that ascended vp even above all hevens to fulfill all thinges .
49004011	And the very same made some Apostles some prophetes some Evangelistes some Sheperdes some Teachers :
49004012	yt the sainctes might have all thinges necessarie to worke and minister with all to the edifyinge of the body of christ
49004013	tyll we every one ( in the vnitie of fayth and knowledge of the sonne of god ) growe vp vnto a parfayte man after ye measure of age of the fulnes of Christ .
49004014	That we hence forth be no moare chyldren wauerynge and caryed with every wynde of doctryne by the wylynes of men and craftynes wherby they laye a wayte for vs to deceave vs .
49004015	But let vs folowe the trueth in loue and in all thynges growe in him which is the heed that ys to saye Christ
49004016	in whom all the body ys coupled and knet togedder in every ioynt wherwith one ministreth to another ( accordinge to the operacion as every parte hath his measure ) and increaseth the body vnto the edyfyinge of it silfe in love .
49004017	This I saye therfore and testifie in ye lorde that ye hence forth walke not as other gentyls walke in vanitie of their mynde
49004018	blynded in their vnderstondynge beynge straungers from the lyfe which is in god thorow the ignorancy that is in them because of the blyndnes of their hertes :
49004019	which beynge past repentaunce have geven them selves vnto wantannes to worke all manner of vnclennes even with gredynes .
49004020	But ye have not so learned Christ
49004021	if so be ye have hearde of him and are taught in him even as the trueth is in Iesu .
49004022	So then as concernynge the coversacion in tyme past laye from you that olde ma which is corrupte thorow the deceavable lustes
49004023	and be ye renued in the sprete of youre myndes
49004024	and put on that newe man which after the ymage of God is shapen in ryghtewesnes and true holynes .
49004025	Wherfore put awaye lyinge and speake every man truth vnto his neghbour for as moche as we are members one of another .
49004026	Be angrye but synne not let not the sonne go doune apon your wrathe
49004027	nether geue place vnto ye backbyter .
49004028	Let him yt stole steale no moare but let him rather laboure with his hondes some good thinge that he maye have to geve vnto him that nedeth .
49004029	Let no filthy comunicacion procede out of youre mouthes : but yt whych is good to edefye with all when nede ys : that it maye have faveour with the hearers .
49004030	And greve not the holy sprete of God by whome ye are sealed vnto the daye of redempcion .
49004031	Let all bitternes fearsnes and wrath rorynge and cursyd speakynge be put awaye from you with all maliciousnes .
49004032	Be ye courteouse one to another and mercifull forgevynge one another eve as god for Christes sake forgave you .
49005001	Be ye folowers of god as dere children
49005002	and walke in love even as Christ loved vs and gave him silfe for vs an offerynge and a sacrifyce of a swete saver to god .
49005003	So that fornicacion and all vnclennes or coveteousnes be not once named amonge you as it be commeth saynctes :
49005004	nether filthynes nether folishe talkyng nether gestinge which are not comly : but rather gevynge of thankes
49005005	For this ye knowe yt no whormonger other vnclene person or coveteous person which is the worshipper of ymages hath eny inheritaunce in the kyngdome of Christ and of God .
49005006	Let no ma deceave you with vayne wordes . For thorow soche thinges cometh the wrath of God vpon the chyldre of vnbelefe .
49005007	Be not therfore companions with them .
49005008	Ye were once dercknes but are now light in the Lorde . Walke as chyldren of light .
49005009	For the frute of the sprete is in all goodnes rightewesnes and trueth .
49005010	Accept that which is pleasinge to the Lorde :
49005011	and have no fellishippe with the vnfrutfull workes of dercknes : but rather rebuke them .
49005012	For it is shame even to name those thinges which are done of them in secrete :
49005013	but all thinges when they are rebuked of the light are manifest . For whatsoever is manifest that same is light .
49005014	Wherfore he sayth : awake thou that slepest and stond vp from deeth and Christ shall geve the light .
49005015	Take hede therfore that ye walke circuspectly : not as foles : but as wyse
49005016	redemynge the tyme : for ye dayes are evyll .
49005017	Wherfore be ye not vnwyse but vnderstonde what the will of the Lorde is
49005018	and be not dronke with wyne wherin is excesse : but be fulfilled with the sprete
49005019	speakynge vnto youre selves in psalmes and ymnes and spretuall songes synginge and makinge melodie to ye Lorde in youre hertes
49005020	gevinge thankes all wayes for all thinges vnto God the father in the name of oure Lorde Iesu Christ :
49005021	submittinge youre selves one to another in the feare of God .
49005022	Wemen submit youre selves vnto youre awne husbandes as vnto the Lorde .
49005023	For the husbande is the wyves heed even as Christ is the heed of the congregacion and the same is the saveoure of the body .
49005024	Therfore as the cogregacion is in subieccion to Christ lykwyse let the wyves be in subieccion to their husbandes in all thinges .
49005025	Husbandes love youre wyves even as Christ loved the congregacion and gave him silfe for it
49005026	to sanctifie it and clensed it in the fountayne of water thorow the worde
49005027	to make it vnto him selfe a glorious congregacion with oute spot or wrynckle or eny soche thinge : but that it shuld be holy and with out blame .
49005028	So ought men to love their wyves as their awne bodyes . He that loveth his wyfe loveth him sylfe .
49005029	For no ma ever yet hated his awne flesshe : but norissheth and cherisseth it even as the lorde doth the congregacion .
49005030	For we are members of his body of his flesshe and of his bones .
49005031	For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cotinue with his wyfe and two shalbe made one flesshe .
49005032	This is a great secrete but I speake bitwene Christ and the cogregacion .
49005033	Neverthelesse do ye so that every one of you love his wyfe truely even as him silfe . And let ye wyfe se that she feare her husbade .
49006001	Chyldren obey youre fathers and mothers in the Lorde : for so is it right .
49006002	Honoure thy father and mother that is the fyrst commaundement that hath eny promes
49006003	that thou mayst be in good estate and lyve longe on the erthe .
49006004	And ye fathers move not youre children to wrath : but bringe the vp wt the norter and informacio of ye Lorde .
49006005	Servautes be obedient vnto youre carnall masters with feare and trimblinge in singlenes of youre hertes as vnto Christ :
49006006	not wt service in ye eye sight as men pleasars : but as the servautes of Christ doynge ye will of God fro the herte
49006007	with good will servinge ye Lorde and not men .
49006008	And remember that whatsoever good thinge eny man doeth that shall he receave agayne of the Lorde whether he be bonde or fre .
49006009	And ye masters do eve the same thinges vnto them puttinge awaye threateninges : and remember that even youre master also is in heven nether is ther eny respecte of person with him .
49006010	Finally my brethre be stronge in the Lorde and in the power of his myght .
49006011	Put on ye armour of God that ye maye stonde stedfast agaynst ye crafty assautes of the devyll .
49006012	For we wrestle not agaynst flesshe and bloud : but agaynst rule agaynst power and agaynst worldy rulars of ye darckenes of this worlde agaynst spretuall wickednes for hevenly thinges .
49006013	For this cause take vnto you the armoure of God yt ye maye be able to resist in the evyll daye and to stonde perfect in all thinges .
49006014	Stonde therfore and youre loynes gyrd aboute with veritie havinge on the brest plate of rightewesnes

50001017	The other parte of love because they se that I am set to defend the gospell .
50001018	What then ? So that Christ be preached all maner wayes whether it be by occasion or of true meaninge I therin ioye : ye and will ioye .
50001019	For I knowe that this shall chaunce to my salvacion thorow youre prayer and ministringe of the sprete of Iesu Christ
50001020	as I hertely loke for and hope that in nothinge I shalbe ashamed : but that with all confidence as all wayes in tymes past even so now Christ shalbe magnified in my body whether it be thorowe lyfe or els deeth .
50001021	For Christ is to me lyfe and deeth is to me a vauntage .
50001022	Yf it chaunce me to live in the flesshe that is to me frutefull forto worke and what to chose I wote not .
50001023	I am constrayned of two thinges : I desyre to be lowsed and to be with Christ which thinge is best of all .
50001024	Neverthelesse to abyde in the flesshe is moare nedfull for you .
50001025	And this am I sure of that I shall abyde and with you all continue for the furtheraunce and ioye of youre fayth
50001026	that ye maye moare aboundantly reioyce in Iesus Christ thorowe me by my comminge to you agayne .
50001027	Only let yovre conversacion be as it be cometh the gospell of Christ : that whether I come and se you or els be absent I maye yet heare of you that ye contynue in one sprete and in one soule labouringe as we do to mayntayne the fayth of the gospell
50001028	and in nothynge fearinge youre adversaries : which is to them a token of perdicion and to you of salvacion and that of God .
50001029	For vnto you it is geven that not only ye shulde beleve on Christ : but also suffre for his sake
50001030	and have eve the same fight which ye sawe me have and now heare of me .
50002001	If ther be amoge you eny consolacion in Christ yf ther be eny cofortable love yf there be eny fellishippe of the sprete yf ther be eny copassion or mercy :
50002002	fulfyll my ioye that ye drawe one waye havinge one love beynge of one accorde and of one mynde
50002003	that nothinge be done thorow stryfe or vayne glory but that in mekenes of mynde every man esteme other better then him selfe
50002004	and that no man consyder his awne but what is mete for other .
50002005	Let the same mynde be in you that was in Christ Iesu :
50002006	Which beynge in the shape of god and thought it not robbery to be equall with god .
50002007	Neverthelesse he made him silfe of no reputacion and toke on him the shape of a servaunte and became lyke vnto men
50002008	and was founde in his aparell as a man . He humbled him silfe and became obediet vnto ye deeth even the deeth of the crosse .
50002009	Wherfore god hath exalted him and geve him a name above all names :
50002010	that in the name of Iesus shuld every knee bowe bothe of thinges in heve and thinges in erth and thinges vnder erth
50002011	and that all tonges shuld confesse that Iesus Christ is the lorde vnto the prayse of God the father .
50002012	Wherfore my dearly beloved as ye have al ways obeyed not when I was present only but now moche more in myne absence even so worke out youre awne saluacio with feare and tremblynge .
50002013	For it is god which worketh in you both ye will and also yt dede eve of good will
50002014	Do all thynge with out murmurynge and disputynge
50002015	that ye maye be fautelesse and pure and the sonnes of God with out rebuke in ye middes of a croked and a perverse nacion amonge which se that ye shyne as lightes in the worlde
50002016	holdinge fast the worde of lyfe vnto my reioysynge in ye daye of Christ that I have not runne in vayne nether have labored in vayne .
50002017	Yee and though I be offered vp vpon the offerynge and sacrifice of youre fayth : I reioyce and reioyce with you all .
50002018	For the same cause also reioyce ye and reioyce ye with me .
50002019	I trust in the lorde Iesus for to sende Timotheus shortly vnto you that I also maye be of good comforte when I knowe what case ye stonde in .
50002020	For I have no ma that is so lyke mynded to me which with so pure affeccio careth for youre matters .
50002021	For all other seke ytir awne and not that which is Iesus Christes
50002022	Ye knowe the proffe of him howe that as a sone with the father so with me bestowed he his labour apon the gospell .
50002023	Him I hope to sende assone as I knowe how it will go with me .
50002024	I trust in the lorde I also my silfe shall come shortly .
50002025	I supposed it necessary to sende brother Epaphroditus vnto you my companion in laboure and felowe soudier youre Apostel and my minister at my nedes .
50002026	For he longed after you and was full of hevines because that ye had hearde saye that he shuld be sicke .
50002027	And no doute he was sicke and that nye vnto deeth . But god had mercy on him : not on him only but on me also lest I shuld have had sorowe apon sorowe .
50002028	I sent him therfore the diligentliar that when ye shuld se him ye myght reioyce agayne and I myght be the lesse sorowfull .
50002029	Receave him therfore in the lorde with all gladnes and make moche of soche :
50002030	because that for ye worke of Christ he went so farre that he was nye vnto deeth and regarded not his lyfe to fulfill that service which was lackynge on youre parte towarde me .
50003001	Morover my brethren reioyce in the lorde . It greveth me not to write one thinge often to you . For to you it is a sure thynge .
50003002	Beware of dogges beware of evyll workers . Beware of dissencion .
50003003	For we are circucision which worshippe god in the sprete and reioyce in Christ Iesu and have no confidence in the flesshe :
50003004	though I have wherof I myght reioyce in the flesshe . Yf eny other man thynketh that he hath wherof he myght trust in the flesshe : moche moare I :
50003005	circumcised the eyght daye of ye kynred of Israhell of ye trybe of Beniamyn an Ebrue borne of ye Ebrues : as concernynge the lawe a pharisaye
50003006	and as concernynge fervetnes I perseuted the congregacion and as touchynge the rightewesnes which is in the lawe I was vnrebukable .
50003007	But the thynges that were vauntage vnto me I counted losse for Christes sake .
50003008	Ye I thinke all thynges but losse for that excellet knowledges sake of Christ Iesu my lorde . For whom I have counted all thynge losse and do iudge them but donge that I myght wynne Christ
50003009	and myght be founde in him not havynge myne awne rightewesnes which is of the lawe : But that which spryngeth of the fayth which is in Christ . I meane the rightewesnes which cometh of God thorowe fayth
50003010	in knowynge him and the vertue of his resurreccion and the fellowshippe of his passions that I myght be coformable vnto his ( deeth )
50003011	yf by eny meanes I myght attayne vnto the resurreccion from deeth .
50003012	Not as though I had all redy attayned to it Ether were all redy parfect : but I folowe yf yt I maye comprehende that wherin I am comprehended of Christ Iesu .
50003013	Brethren I counte not my silfe that I have gotten it : but one thynge I saye : I forget yt which is behynde and stretche my silfe vnto that which is before
50003014	and preace vnto ye marke apoynted to obtayne the rewarde of the hye callynge of god in Christ Iesu .
50003015	Let vs therfore as many as be perfect be thus wyse minded : and yf ye be other wyse mynded I praye God open even this vnto you .
50003016	Neverthelesse in that wher vnto we are come let vs procede by one rule yt we maye be of one acorde .
50003017	Brethren be folowers of and me loke on them which walke even so as ye have vs for an ensample .
50003018	For many walke ( of whom I have tolde you often and now tell you wepynge ) that they are ye enemyes of ye crosse of Christ
50003019	whose ende is dampnacio whose God is their bely and whose glory is to their shame which are worldely mynded .
50003020	But oure conversacion is in heven from whence we loke for a saveour enen the lorde Iesus Christ
50003021	which shall chaunge oure vile bodies that they maye be fassioned lyke vnto his glorious body acordinge to the workynge wherby he is able to subdue all thinges vnto hym silfe .
50004001	Herfore my brethren dearly beloved and longed for my ioye and croune so continue in the lorde ye beloved .
50004002	I praye Evodias and beseche Sintiches that they be of one accorde in the lorde .
50004003	Yee and I beseche the faythfull yockfelowe helpe the wemen which labored with me in the gospell and with Clement also and with other my labour felowes whose names are in the boke of lyfe .
50004004	Reioyce in the Lorde alwaye and agayne I saye reioyce .
50004005	Let youre softenes be knowen vnto all men . The lorde is even at honde .
50004006	Be not carfull : but in all thynges shewe youre peticion vnto god in prayer and suplicacion wt gevynge of thankes .
50004007	And the peace of god which passeth all vnderstondinge kepe youre hertes and myndes in christ Iesu .
50004008	Furthermore brethren whatsoever thinges are true whatsoever thynges are honest what soever thynges are iust whatsoever thynges are pure whatsoever thynges pertayne to love whatsoever thynges are of honest reporte : yf ther be eny verteous thynge yf there be eny laudable thynge
50004009	those same have ye in youre mynde which ye have both learned and receaved herde and also sene in me : those thynges do and the god of peace shalbe with you .
50004010	I reioyse in the lorde greatly that now at the last ye are revived agayne to care for me in yt wherein ye were also carefull but ye lacked oportunite .
50004011	I speake not because of necessitie . For I have learned in whatsoever estate I am therewith to be content .
50004012	I can both cast doune my silfe I can also excede . Every where and in all thynges I am instructed both to be full and to be hongry : to have plenty and to suffre nede .
50004013	I can do all thynges thorow the helpe of Christ which strengtheth me .
50004014	Not wistondynge ye have well done that ye bare parte with me in my tribvlacion .
50004015	Ye of Philippos knowe that in the begynnynge of the gospell when I departed from Macedonia no congregacion bare parte with me as concernynge gevynge and receavynge but ye only .
50004016	For when I was in Tessalonica ye sent once and afterwarde agayne vnto my nedes :
50004017	not that I desyre gyftes : but I desyre aboudant frute on youre parte .
50004018	I receaved all and have plentie . I was even filled after that I had receaved of Epaphroditus that which came from you an odour that smelleth swete a sacrifice accepted and plesaunt to God .
50004019	My god fulfill all youre nedes thorow his glorious riches in Iesu Christ .
50004020	Vnto God and oure father be prayse for ever more . Amen .
50004021	Salute all the sainctes in Christ Iesu . The brethren which are with me grete you .
50004022	All the saynctes salute you : and most of all they which are of the Emperours housholde .
50004023	The grace of oure lorde Iesu Christ be wt you all . Amen
51001001	Paul an Apostle of Iesu Christ by the wyll of God and brother Timotheus .
51001002	To the sayntes which are at Colossa and brethren that beleve in Christ . Grace be with you and peace from God oure father and from the Lorde Iesus Christ .
51001003	We geve thankes to God the father of oure Lorde Iesus Christ alwayes prayenge for you
51001004	sence we hearde of youre faith which ye have in Christ Iesu and of the love which ye beare to all sayntes
51001005	for the hopes sake which is layde vp in store for you in heven of which hope ye have herde before by ye true worde of the gospell
51001006	which is come vnto you eve as it is in to all ye worlde and is frutefull as it is amoge you fro the fyrst daye in ye which ye herde of it and had experiece in ye grace of God in the trueth
51001007	as ye learned of Epaphra oure deare felowe servaunt which is for you a faythfull minister of Christ
51001008	which also declared vnto vs youre love which ye have in the sprete .
51001009	For this cause we also sence the daye we herde of it have not ceasyd prayinge for you and desyringe that ye myght be fulfilled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdome and spretuall vnderstodynge
51001010	that ye myght walke worthy of the lorde in all thynges that please beynge frutfull in all good workes and encreasynge in ye knowledge of God
51001011	strengthed with all myght thorowe hys glorious power vnto all pacience and longe sufferynge with ioyfulnes
51001012	gevynge thankes vnto the father which hath made vs mete to be part takers of the enheritaunce of sainctes in light .
51001013	Which hath delivered vs from the power of dercknes and hath translated vs in to the kyngdome of his dere sone
51001014	in whom we have redempcion thurow his bloud that is to saye the forgevenes of sinnes
51001015	which is the ymage of the invisible god fyrst begotten of all creatures .
51001016	For by him were all thynges created thynges that are in heven and thynges that are in erth : thynges visible and thynges invisible : whether they be maieste or lordshippe ether rule or power . All thinges are creatyd by hym and in him
51001017	and he is before all thinges and in him all thynges have their beynge .
51001018	And he is the heed of the body that is to wit of the congregacion : he is the begynnynge and fyrst begotten of the deed that in all thynges he might have the preeminence .
51001019	For it pleased the father that in him shuld all fulnes dwell
51001020	and by him to reconcile all thynge vnto him silfe and to set at peace by him thorow the bloud of his crosse both thynges in heven and thynges in erth .
51001021	And you ( which were in tymes past straungers and enymes because youre myndes were set in evyll workes ) hath he now recocilied
51001022	in ye body of his flesshe thorowe deeth to make you holy vnblameable and with out faut in his awne syght
51001023	yf ye continue grounded and stablysshed in the fayth and be not moved awaye from the hope of the gospell wher of ye have herde howe that it is preached amonge all creatures which are vnder heven wher of I Paul am made a minister .
51001024	Now ioye I in my soferinges which I suffre for you and fulfill that which is behynde of the passions of Christ in my flesshe for his bodies sake which is the congregacion
51001025	wher of I am made a minister acordynge to the ordinaunce of god which ordinaunce was geven me vnto you warde to fulfill ye worde of god
51001026	that mistery hid sence the worlde beganne and sence ye begynnynge of generacions : but now is opened to his saynctes
51001027	to whom god wolde make knowen the glorious riches of this mistery amonge the gentyls which riches is Christ in you the hope of glory
51001028	whom we preach warnynge all men and teachinge all men in all wisdome to make all men parfect in Christ Iesu .
51001029	Wherin I also laboure and stryve even as farforth as hys workynge worketh in me myghtely .
51002001	I wolde ye knewe what fyghtinge I have for youre sakes and for them of Laodicia and for as many as have not sene my parson in the flesshe
51002002	that their hertes myght be coforted and knet togedder in love and in all ryches of full vnderstondynge for to knowe ye mistery of God ye father and of Christ
51002003	in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
51002004	This I saye lest eny man shuld begyle you with entysinge wordes .
51002005	For though I be absent in the flesshe yet am I present with you in the sprete ioyinge and beholdinge the order that ye kepe and youre stedfast fayth in Christ .
51002006	As ye have therfore receaved Christ Iesu the Lorde even so walke
51002007	roted and bylt in him and stedfaste in the fayth as ye have learned : and therin be plenteous in gevynge thankes .
51002008	Beware lest eny ma come and spoyle you thorow philosophy and disceatfull vanitie thorow the tradicions of me and ordinaunces after the worlde and not after christ .
51002009	For in him dwelleth all the fulnes of the godheed bodyly
51002010	and ye are complete in him which is the heed of all rule and power
51002011	in whom also ye are circucised with circumcision made mith out hondes by puttinge of the sinfull boddy of the flesshe thorow the circumcision yt is in Christ
51002012	in that ye are buryed with him thorow baptim in whom ye are also rysen agayne thorowe fayth that is wrought by the operacion of god which raysed him from deeth .
51002013	And ye which weare deed in synne thorow ye vncircucision of youre flesshe hath he quyckened wt him and hath forgeve vs all oure trespases
51002014	and hath put out ye handwritinge yt was agaynst vs cotayned in ye lawe writte and that hath he take out of the waye and hath fastened it to his crosse
51002015	and hath spoyled rule and power and hath made a shewe of the openly and hath triumphed over them in his awne persone .
51002016	Let no ma therfore trouble youre conscieces aboute meate and drynke or for a pece of an holydaye as the holydaye of the newe mone or of the sabboth dayes
51002017	which are nothinge but shaddowes of thynges to come : but the body is in Christ .
51002018	Let no man make you shote at a wroge ( marke ) which after his awne ymaginacion walketh in the humblenes and holynes of angels thinges which he never sawe : causlesse puft vp with his flesshly mynde
51002019	and holdeth not the heed wherof all the body by ioyntes and couples receaveth norisshment and is knet to gedder and encreaseth with the in creasynge that commeth of god .
51002020	Wherfore if ye be deed with Christ fro ordinaunces of the worlde why as though ye yet lived in the worlde are ye ledde with tradicios of them that saye ?
51002021	Touche not tast not handell not :
51002022	which all perysshe wt the vsinge of the and are after the comaundmentes and doctrins of men
51002023	which thinges have the similitude of wisdome in chosen holynes and humblenes and in that they spare not the body and do the flesshe no worshype vnto his nede .
51003001	If ye be then rysen agayne with christ seke those thynges which are above where Christ sitteth on the right honde of god .
51003002	Set youre affeccion on thynges yt are above and not on thinges which are on ye erth .
51003003	For ye are deed and youre lyfe is hid with Christ in god .
51003004	When Christ which is oure lyfe shall shewe him silfe then shall ye also appere with him in glory .
51003005	Mortifie therfore youre membres which are on the erth fornicacio vnclennes vnnaturall lust evyll cocupiscece and coveteousnes which is worshippynge of ydols :
51003006	for which thynges sakes the wrath of God cometh on the chyldren of vnbeleve .
51003007	In which thynges ye walked once . when ye lived in them .
51003008	But now put ye also awaye from you all thynges wrath fearsnes maliciousnes cursed speakynge filthy speakynge out of youre mouthes .
51003009	Lye not one to another that the olde man with his workes be put of
51003010	and the new put on which is renued in knowledge after the ymage of him that made him
51003011	where is nether gentile ner Iewe circumcision nor vncircumcision Barbarous or Sithian bonde or fre : but Christe is all in all thynges .
51003012	Now therfore as electe of god holy and beloved put on tender mercie kyndnes humblenes of myndes meknes longe sufferynge
51003013	forbearynge one another and forgevynge one another if eny man have a quarrell to a nother even as Christ forgave you even so do ye .
51003014	Above all these thinges put on love which is the bonde of parfectnes .
51003015	And ye peace of god rule in youre hertes to ye which peace ye are called in one body . And se that ye be thankfull .
51003016	Let the worde of Christ dwell in you plenteously in all wisdome . Teache and exhorte youre awne selves in psalmes and hymnes and spretuall songes which have favour wt them syngynge in youre hertes to the lorde .
51003017	And all thynges ( whatsoever ye do in worde or dede ) do in the name of the lorde Iesu gevinge thakes to god the father by him .
51003018	Wyves submit youre selves vnto youre awne husbandes as it is comly in the Lorde .
51003019	Husbandes love youre wyves and be not bitter vnto them .
51003020	Children obey youre fathers and mothers in all thinges for that is wel pleasynge vnto the lorde .
51003021	Fathers rate not youre children lest they be of a desperate mynde .
51003022	Servauntes be obedient vnto youre bodyly masters in all thynges : not with eye service as men pleasers but in synglenes of herte fearynge god .
51003023	And whatsoever ye do do it hertely as though ye did it to the lorde and not vnto men for as moche as ye
51003024	knowe that of the lorde ye shall receave the rewarde of inheritaunce for ye serve the lorde Christ .
51003025	But he that doth wronge shall receave for the wronge that he hath done : for there is no respect of persons .
51004001	Ye masters do vnto youre servauntes that which is iust and egall seinge ye knowe that ye also have a master in heven .
51004002	Continue in prayer and watch in the same with thankes

52001004	because we knowe brethren beloved of god how yt ye are electe .
52001005	For oure gospell came not vnto you in worde only but also in power and also in the holy gost and in moche certayntie as ye knowe after what maner we behaued oure selves amonge you for youre sakes .
52001006	And ye became folowers of vs and of the lord and receaved the worde in moche affliccion with ioye of the holy gost :
52001007	so that ye were an ensample to all that beleve in Macedonia and Achaia .
52001008	For from you sounded out the worde of the lorde not in Macedonia and in Achaia only : but youre fayth also which ye have vnto god spred her silfe abroade in all quartars so greatly that it nedeth not vs to speake eny thynge at all .
52001009	For they the selves shewe of you what maner of entrynge in we had vnto you and how ye tourned to God from ymages for to serve the livynge and true god
52001010	and for to loke for his sonne from heven whom he raysed from deeth : I mean Iesus which delivereth vs from wrath to come .
52002001	For ye youre selves knowe brethren of oure entraunce in vnto you howe that it was not in vayne :
52002002	but even after that we had suffered before and were shamfully entreated at Phillippos ( as ye well knowe ) then were we bolde in oure God to speake vnto you the gospell of God with moche strivynge .
52002003	Oure exhortacion was not to brynge you to erroure nor yet to vnclennes nether was it with gyle :
52002004	but as we were alowed of God that the gospell shuld be comitted vnto vs : even so we speake not as though we entended to please men but God which trieth oure hertes .
52002005	Nether was oure conversacion at eny tyme wt flatterynge wordes as ye well knowe nether in cloked coveteousnes God is recorde :
52002006	nether sought we prayse of men nether of you nor yet of eny other when we myght have bene chargeable as the apostles of Christ
52002007	but we were tender amonge you even as a norsse cheressheth her children
52002008	so was oure affeccion towarde you oure good will was to have dealte vnto you not the gospell of God only : but also oure awne soules because ye were deare vnto vs .
52002009	Ye remember brethre oure laboure and travayle . For we laboured daye and nyght because we wolde not be greveous vnto eny of you and preached vnto you ye gospell of God .
52002010	Ye are witnesses and so is god how holyly and iustly and vnblameable we behaved oure selves amonge you that beleve :
52002011	as ye knowe how that we exhorted and comforted and besought every one of you as a father his childre
52002012	that ye wolde walke worthy of God which hath called you vnto his kyngdome and glory .
52002013	For this cause thanke we god with out ceasynge because that when ye receaved of vs the worde wherwith God was preached ye receaved it not as the worde of man : but even as it was in dede the worde of God which worketh in you that beleve .
52002014	For ye brethre became folowers of the congregacions of god which in Iewry are in Christ Iesu : for ye have suffered lyke thynges of youre kynsmen as we oure selves have suffered of the Iewes .
52002015	Which as they kylled the lorde Iesus and their awne prophetes even so have they persecuted vs and God they please not and are contrary to all men
52002016	and forbid vs to preache vnto the gentyls that they myght be saved to fulfill their synnes all waye . For the wrath of God is come on them even to the vtmost .
52002017	For as moch brethren as we are kept from you for a season as concernynge the bodyly presence but not in the herte we enforsed the more to se you personally with great desire .
52002018	And therfore we wolde have come vnto you I paul once and agayne : but Satan with stode vs .
52002019	For what is oure hope or ioye or croune of reioysynge ? are not ye it in the presence of oure lorde Iesus Christ at his comynge ?
52002020	yes ye are oure glory and ioye .
52003001	Wherfore sence we coulde no lenger forbeare it pleased vs to remayne at Athens alone
52003002	and sent Timotheus oure brother and minister of god and oure laboure felowe in the gospell of Christ to stablysshe you and to coforte you over youre fayth
52003003	yt no ma shulde be moved in these affliccios . For ye youre selves knowe that we are even apoynted therevnto .
52003004	For verely when I was with you I tolde you before that we shulde suffre tribulacion even as it came to passe and as ye knowe .
52003005	For this cause when I coulde no lenger forbeare I sent that I myght have knowledge of youre fayth lest haply the tempter had tempted you and that oure laboure had bene bestowed in vayne .
52003006	But now lately whe Timotheus came fro you vnto vs and declared to vs youre fayth and youre love and how that ye have good remembraunce of vs all wayes desyringe to se vs as we desyre to se you .
52003007	Therfore brethre we had consolacion in you in all oure adversite and necessite through youre fayth .
52003008	For now are we alyve yf ye stonde stedfast in the lorde .
52003009	For what thankes can we recompence to god agayne for you over all the ioye that we ioye for youre sakes before oure god
52003010	whyle we nyght and daye praye excedingly that we myght se you presently and myght fulfill that wich is lackynge in youre fayth .
52003011	God him silfe oure father and oure lorde Iesus Christ gyde oure iorney vnto you :
52003012	and the lorde increace you and make you flowe ouer in love one towarde another and towarde all men even as we do towarde you
52003013	to make youre hertes stable and vnblameable in holynes before God oure father at the commynge of oure Lorde Iesus Christ with all his sainctes .
52004001	Further more we beseche you brethren and exhorte you in the lorde Iesus that ye increace more and more euen as ye have receaved of vs how ye ought to walke and to please god .
52004002	Ye remember what commaundmetes we gave you in oure lorde Iesu Christ .
52004003	For this is the will of god even that ye shuld be holy and that ye shuld abstayne from fornicacion
52004004	that every one of you shuld knowe how to kepe his vessell in holynes and honoure
52004005	and not in the lust of concupiscence as do the hethen which knowe not god
52004006	that no man goo to farre and defraude his brother in bargayninge : because the lorde is a venger of all suche thinges as we tolde you before tyme and testified .
52004007	For god hath not called vs vnto vnclennes : but vnto holynes .
52004008	He therfore that despiseth despiseth not man but God which hath sent his holy sprete amonge you .
52004009	But as touchynge brotherly love ye nede not that I wryte vnto you . For ye are taught of God to love on another .
52004010	Ye and that thinge verely ye do vnto all the brethre which are thorow oute all Macedonia . We beseche you brethren that ye encreace more and more
52004011	and that ye studye to be quyet and to medle with youre awne busynes and to worke with youre awne hondes as we commaunded you :
52004012	that ye maye behave youre selves honestly towarde them that are with out and that nothinge be lackynge vnto you .
52004013	I wolde not brethren have you ignoraut concerninge them which are fallen aslepe that ye sorowe not as other do which have no hope .
52004014	For yf we beleve that Iesus dyed and rose agayne : even so them also which slepe by IeIesus will God brynge agayne with him .
52004015	And this saye we vnto you in the worde of the Lorde that we which live and are remayninge in the comminge of the Lorde shall not come yerre they which slepe .
52004016	For the Lorde him selfe shall descende fro heve with a showte and the voyce of the archangell and trompe of God . And the deed in Christe shall aryse fyrst :
52004017	then shall we which live and remayne be caught vp with them also in the cloudes to mete the Lorde in ye ayer . And so shall we ever be with the Lorde .
52004018	Wherfore coforte youre selves one another with these wordes
52005001	Of the tymes and seasons brethren ye have no nede that I write vnto you :
52005002	for ye youre selves knowe parfectly that the daye of the Lorde shall come even as a thefe in the nyght .
52005003	When they shall saye peace and no daunger than commeth on the soden destruccion as the travalynge of a woma with childe and they shall not scape .
52005004	But ye brethre are not in darcknes that yt daye shuld come on you as it were a thefe .
52005005	Ye are all the childre of light and the children of ye daye . We are not of ye nyght nether of darcknes .
52005006	Therfore let vs not slepe as do other : but let vs watch and be sober .
52005007	For they that slepe slepe in the nyght : and they that be dronken are dronken in the nyght .
52005008	But let vs which are of the daye be sober    armed with the brest plate of fayth and love and with hope of salvacio as an helmet .
52005009	For god hath not apoynted vs vnto wrath : but to obtayne salvacion by ye meanes of oure lorde Iesu Christ
52005010	which died for vs : that whether we wake or slepe we shuld lyve togedder with him .
52005011	Wherfore comforte youre selves togedder and edifie one another even as ye do .
52005012	We beseche you brethren that ye knowe them which laboure amonge you and have the oversight of you in the Lorde
52005013	and geve you exhortacion that ye have them the more in love for their workes sake and be at peace with them .
52005014	We desyre you brethre warne them that are vnruly comforte the feble mynded forbeare the weake have continuall pacience towarde all men .
52005015	Se that none recopence evill for evyll vnto eny man : but ever folowe that which is good both amonge youre selves and to all men .
52005016	Reioyce ever .
52005017	Praye cotinually .
52005018	In all thinges geve thankes . For this is the wyll of God in Christ Iesu towarde you .
52005019	Quenche not the sprete .
52005020	Despise not prophesyinge .
52005021	Examen all thinges and kepe that which is good .
52005022	Abstayne from all suspicious thinges .
52005023	The very God of peace sanctifie you thorow out . And I praye God that youre whole sprete soulse and body be kept fautlesse vnto ye comynge of oure Lorde Iesus Christ
52005024	Faythfull is he which called you : which will also do it .
52005025	Brethre praye for vs .
52005026	Grete all the brethren with an holy kysse .
52005027	I charge you in the Lorde that this pistle be reed vnto all the holy brethren .
52005028	The grace of the Lorde Iesus Christ be with you . Amen .
53001001	Paul Syluanus and Timotheus . Vnto the congregacion of the Tessalonyans which are in God oure father and in the Lorde Iesus Christ .
53001002	Grace be with you and peace from God oure father and from the Lorde Iesus Christ .
53001003	We are bounde to thanke God all wayes for you brethren as it is mete because that youre fayth groweth excedyngly and every one of you swymmeth in love towarde another betwene youre selves
53001004	so yt we oureselves reioyce of you in the congregacions of God over youre pacience and fayth in all youre persecucions and tribulacios that ye suffre
53001005	which is a token of ye ryghtewes iudgemet of god that ye are counted worthy of the kyngdom of god for which ye also suffre .
53001006	It is verely a rightewes thinge with God to recopence tribulacion to them that trouble you :
53001007	and to you which are troubled rest with vs when the lorde Iesus shall shewe him silfe from heven with his myghty angels
53001008	in flammynge fyre rendrynge vengeaunce vnto them that knowe not God and to them that obeye not vnto the gospell of oure Lorde Iesus Christ
53001009	which shalbe punysshed with everlastynge damnacion from the presence of the lorde and from the glory of his power
53001010	when he shall come to be glorified in his sainctes and to be made marvelous in all them that beleve : because oure testimonye that we had vnto you was beleved eve the same daye that we preached it .
53001011	Wherfore we praye all wayes for you that oure god make you worthy of the callynge and fulfill all delectacion of goodnes and the worke of fayth with power :
53001012	that the name of oure lorde Iesus Christ maye be gloryfied in you and ye in him thorowe the grace of oure God and of the lorde Iesus Christ .
53002001	We beseche you brethren by the commynge of oure lorde Iesu Christ and in that we shall assemble vnto him
53002002	that ye be not sodely moved from youre mynde and be not troubled nether by sprete nether by wordes nor yet by letter which shuld seme to come from vs as though the daye of Christ were at honde .
53002003	Let no ma deceave you by eny meanes for the lorde commeth not excepte ther come a departynge fyrst and that that synfnll man be opened ye sonne of perdicion
53002004	which is an adversarie and is exalted above all that is called god or that is worshipped : so that he shall sitt as God in temple of god and shew him silfe as god .
53002005	Remember ye not that when I was yet with you I tolde you these thynges ?
53002006	And nowe ye knowe what with holdeth : even that he myght be vttered at his tyme .
53002007	For the mistery of that iniquitie doeth he all readie worke which onlie loketh vntill it be taken out of ye waye .
53002008	And then shall that wicked be vttered whom the lorde shall consume with the sprete of hys mouth and shall destroye with the apearaunce of his commynge
53002009	even him whose commynge is by the workynge of Satan wyth all lyinge power signes and wonders :
53002010	and in all deceavablenes of vnrightewesnes amonge them that perysshe : because they receaved not the ( love ) of the truth that they myght have bene saved .
53002011	And therfore god shall sende them stronge delusion that they shuld beleve lyes :
53002012	that all they myght be damned which beleved not the trueth but had pleasure in vnrightewesnes .
53002013	But we are bounde to geve thankes alwaye to god for you brethren beloved of the lorde for because that God hath from the begynnynge chosen you to saluacion thorow sanctifyinge of the sprete and thorowe belevynge the trueth :
53002014	whervnto he called you byoure gospell to obtayne ye glorye that cometh of oure lord Iesu Christ .
53002015	Therfore brethren stonde fast and kepe ye ordinaunces which ye have learned : whether it were by oure preachynge or by pistle .
53002016	Oure lorde Iesu Christ hym silfe and God oure father which hath loved vs and hath geven vs everlastynge consolacion and good hope thorowe grace
53002017	comforte youre hertes and stablysshe you in all doctrine and good doynge .
53003001	Furthermore brethren praye for vs yt the worde of god maye have fre passage and be gloryfied as it is with you :
53003002	and that we maye be delivered from vnresonable and evyll men . For all men have not fayth :
53003003	but the lorde is faythfull which shall stablysshe you and kepe you from evyll .
53003004	Wehave confidence thorow the lorde to you warde that ye both do and will do that which we comaude you .
53003005	And ye lorde gyde youre hertes vnto ye love of God and paciece of Christ .
53003006	We requyre you brethren in the name of oure lorde Iesu Christ yt ye with drawe youre selves from every brother that walketh inordinatly and not after the institucio which ye receaved of vs .
53003007	Ye youre selves knowe how ye ought to folowe vs . For we behaved not oure selves inordinatly amonge you .
53003008	Nether toke we breed of eny ma for nought : but wrought with laboure and travayle nyght and daye because we wolde not be grevous to eny of you :
53003009	not but that we had auctoritie : but to make oure selves an insample vnto you to folowe vs .
53003010	For when we were with you this we warned you of yt yf ther were eny which wolde not worke that ye same shuld not eate .
53003011	We have hearde saye no doute that ther are some which walke amonge you inordinatly and worke not at all but are besy bodies .
53003012	Them that are soche we commaunde and exhorte by oure lorde Iesu Christ that they worke with quyetnes and eate their awne breed .
53003013	Brethren be not wery in well doynge .
53003014	Yf eny man obey not oure sayinges sende vs worde of him by a letter : and have no copanie with him that he maye be ashamed .
53003015	And count him not as an enemy : but warne him as a brother .
53003016	The very lorde of peace geve you peace all wayes by all meanes . The lorde be with you all .
53003017	The salutacion of me Paul with myne awne honde . This is the token in all pistles . So I write .
53003018	The grace of oure lorde Iesus Christ be with you all Amen .
54001001	Paul an Apostle of Iesus Christ by the comaundement of God oure savioure and Lorde Iesus Christ which is oure hope .
54001002	Vnto Timothe his naturall sonne in the fayth . Grace mercy and peace from God oure father and Lorde Iesus Christ oure Lorde .
54001003	As I besought the to abyde styll in Ephesus when I departed into Macedonia even so do that thou comaunde some that they teache no nother wise :
54001004	nether geve hede to fables and genealogies which are endlesse and brede doutes more then godly edyfyinge which is by fayth :
54001005	for ye ende of the comaundemet is love that cometh of a pure herte and of a good conscience and of fayth vnfayned :
54001006	fro the which thinges some have erred and have turned vnto vayne iangelinge
54001007	because they wolde be doctours the scripture and yet vnderstonde not what they speake nether wherof they affirme .
54001008	We knowe yt the lawe is good yf a man vse it lawfully
54001009	vnderstondinge this how yt the lawe is not geven vnto a righteous man bu vnto the vnrighteous and disobediet to the vngodly and to synners to vnholy and vnclean to murtherers of fathers and murtherers of mothers to manslears
54001010	and whormongers : to them that defile them selves with mankynde : to menstealers : to lyars and to periured and so forth yf ther be eny other thinge that is cotrary to holsome doctrine
54001011	accordinge to the gospell of the glory of the blessed God which gospell is committed vnto me .
54001012	And I thanke Christ Iesus oure Lorde which hath made me stronge : for he counted me true and put me in office
54001013	when before I was a blasphemar and a persecuter and a tyraut . But I obtayned mercy because I dyd it ignorautly thorow vnbelefe .
54001014	Neverthelater the grace of oure Lorde was more aboundaunt with fayth and love which is in Christ Iesu .
54001015	This is a true sayinge and by all meanes worthy to be receaved that Christ Iesus came into the world to save synners of whom I am chefe .
54001016	Notwithstondinge for this cause was mercy geve vnto me that Iesus Christ shuld fyrst shewe on me all longe pacience vnto the ensample of them which shall in tyme to come beleve on him vnto eternall lyfe .
54001017	So then vnto god kynge everlastinge immortall invisible and wyse only be honoure and prayse for ever and ever Amen .
54001018	This commaundement commit I vnto the sonne Timotheus accordynge to the prophisies which in tyme past were prophisied of the yt thou in them shuldest fyght a good fyght
54001019	havinge fayth and good consciece which some have put awaye fro them and as cocerninge fayth have made shipwracke .
54001020	Of whose nombre is Himeneus and Alexander which I have delivered vnto Satan yt they myght be taught not to blaspheme
54002001	I exhorte therfore that above all thynges prayers supplicacions intercessions and gevynge of thankes behad for all men :
54002002	for kynges and for all that are in auctorite that we maye live a quyet and a peasable life in all godlines and honestie .
54002003	For that is good and accepted in the sight of god oure savioure
54002004	which will have all men saved and to come vnto the knowledge of ye trueth .
54002005	For ther is one god and one ( mediator ) bitwene god and man which is ye man Christ Iesus
54002006	which gave him silfe a raunsome for all men that it shuld be testified at his tyme
54002007	wherevnto I am ordayned a preacher and an apostle : I tell the trueth in Christ and lye not beynge the teacher of the gentyls in fayth and veritie .
54002008	I wyll therfore that the men praye every where liftynge vp pure hondes without wrath or dowtinge .
54002009	Lykwyse also the wemen that they araye them selves in comlye aparell with shamfastnes and discrete behaveour not with broyded heare other golde or pearles or costly araye :
54002010	but with suche as becometh wemen that professe the worshippynge of God thorow good workes .
54002011	Let the woman learne in silence with all subieccion .
54002012	I suffre not a woman to teache nether to have auctoricie over a man : but forto be in silence .
54002013	For Adam was fyrst formed and then Eve .
54002014	Also Adam was not deceaved but the woman was deceaved and was in transgression .
54002015	Notwithstondynge thorow bearinge of chyldre they shalbe saved so they continue in fayth love and holynes with discrecion .
54003001	This is a true sayinge . Yf a ma covet ye office of a bysshope he desyreth a good worke .
54003002	Ye and a bisshope must be fautlesse the husband of one wyfe sober discrete honestly aparelled harberous apt to teache
54003003	not dronke no fighter not geve to filthy lucre : but gentle abhorrynge fightynge abhorrynge coveteousnes
54003004	and one that rueleth his awne housse honestly havynge chyldren vnder obedience with all honeste .
54003005	For yf a man cannot rule his owne housse how shall he care for the congregacion of God .
54003006	He maye not be a yonge skoler lest he swell and faule into the iudgement of the evyll
54003007	speaker . He must also be well reported of amonge them which are with out forth lest he fall into rebuke and snare of the evyll speaker .
54003008	Lykwyse must the deacons be honest not double tonged not geve vnto moche drynkinge nether vnto filthy lucre :
54003009	but havynge the mistery of the fayth in pure consciece .
54003010	And let them fyrst be proved and then let them minister yf they be founde fautlesse .
54003011	Even so must their wynes be honest not evyll speakers : but sober and faythfull in all thinges .
54003012	Let the deacons be the husbandes of one wyfe and suche as rule their chyldren well and their awne housholdes .
54003013	For they that minister well get them selves good degre and greate libertie in the fayth which is in Christ Iesu .
54003014	These thinges write I vnto the trustinge to come shortly vnto the :
54003015	but and yf I tarie longe yt then thou mayst yet have knowledge how thou oughtest to behave thy silfe in the housse of God which is the congregacion of the livinge God the pillar and grounde of trueth .
54003016	And with out naye great is that mistery of godlines : God was shewed in the flesshe was iustified in the sprete was sene of angels was preached vnto the gentyls was beleved on in erth and receaved vp in glory .
54004001	The sprete speaketh evydently that in the latter tymes some shall departe from the fayth and shall geve hede vnto spretes of erroure and dyvelysshe doctrine of them
54004002	which speake falce thorow ypocrisye and have their consciences marked with an hote yron
54004003	forbyddinge to mary and commaundinge to abstayne from meates which God hath created to be receaved with gevynge thankes of them which beleve and knowe ye trueth .
54004004	For all the creatures of God are good and nothynge to be refused yf it be receaved with thankes gevynge .
54004005	For it is sanctyfyed by the worde of God and prayer .
54004006	Yf thou shalt put the brethren in remembraunce of these thynges thou shalt be a good minister of Iesu Christ which hast bene norisshed vp in the wordes of the fayth and good doctryne which doctryne thou hast continually followed .
54004007	But cast awaye vngostly and olde wyves fables . Exercyse thy silfe vnto godlines .
54004008	For bodely exercise proffiteth lyttll : But godlines is good vnto all thynges as a thynge which hath promyses of the lyfe that is now and of the lyfe to come .
54004009	This is a sure sayinge and of all parties worthy to be receaved .
54004010	For therfore we laboure and suffre rebuke because we beleve in the livynge god which is the savioure of all men : but specially of those that beleve .
54004011	Suche thynges commaunde and teache .
54004012	Let no man despyse thy youth : but be vnto them that beleve an insample in worde in conversacion in love in sprete in fayth and in purenes .
54004013	Till I come geve attendaunce to redynge to exhortacion and to doctryne .
54004014	Despyse not the gyfte that is in ye which was geven the thorow prophesye and with layinge on of ye hondes of an elder .
54004015	These thynges exercyse and geve thy silfe vnto them that it maye be sene how thou profetest in all thinges .
54004016	Take hede vnto thy silfe and vnto learnynge and continue therin . For if thou shalt so do thou shalt save thy silfe and them that heare the .
54005001	Rebuke not an elder : but exhorte him as a father and the yonger me as brethren
54005002	the elder wemen as mothers ye yonger as sisters with all purenes .
54005003	Honoure widdowes which are true wyddowes .
54005004	Yf eny wyddowe have chyldren or neves let them learne fyrst to rule their awne houses godly and to recompence their elders . For that is good and acceptable before God .
54005005	She that is a very wyddowe and frendlesse putteth her trust in god and continueth in supplicacion and prayer nyght and daye .
54005006	But she that liveth in pleasure is deed even yet alive .
54005007	And these thynges commaunde that they maye be without faut
54005008	Yf ther be eny that provideth not for his awne and namly for them of his housholde the same denyeth the fayth and is worsse then an infydell .
54005009	Let no wyddowe be chosen vnder threscore yere olde and soche a one as was the wyfe of one man
54005010	and well reported of in good workes : yf she have noresshed children yf she have bene liberall to straugers yf she have wesshed the saynctes fete yf she have ministred vnto them which were in adversite yf she were continually geve vnto all maner good workes .
54005011	The yonger widdowes refuse . For when they have begone to wexe wantone to the dishonoure of Christ then will they mary
54005012	havynge damnacio because they have broke their fyrst fayth .
54005013	And also they learne to goo from housse to housse ydle ye not ydle only but also tryflynge and busybodyes speakynge thynges which are not comly .
54005014	I will therfore that ye yonger weme mary and beare childre and gyde the housse and geve none occasio to ye adversary to speake evill
54005015	For many of them are all redy turned bake and are gone after Satan .
54005016	And yf eny man or woman that beleveth have widdowes let the minister vnto them and let not the congregacion be charged : that yt maye have sufficient for them that are widdowes in dede .
54005017	The elders yt rule wel are worthy of double honoure most specially they which laboure in ye worde and in teachinge .
54005018	For the scripture sayth : Thou shalt not mousell the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the corne . And the labourer is worthy of his rewarde .
54005019	Agaynst an elder receave none accusacion : but vnder two or thre witnesses .
54005020	Them that synne rebuke openly that other maye feare .
54005021	I testifie before god and the lorde Iesus Christ and the electe angels that thou observe these thynges with out hasty iudgement and do nothynge parcially .
54005022	Laye hondes sodely on no man nether be partaker of other mes synnes : kepe thy silfe pure .
54005023	Drynke no lenger water but vse a lytell wyne for thy stommakes sake and thyne often diseases .
54005024	Some mennes synnes are open before honde and goo before vnto iudgement : some mennes synnes folowe after .
54005025	Lykwyse also good workes are manyfest before honde and they that are other wyse canot be hid .
54006001	Let as many servauntes as are vnder ye yoke counte their masters worthy of all honour that the name of god and his doctryne be not evyll spoken of .
54006002	Se that they which have belevynge masters despyse them not because they are brethren : but so moche the rather do service for as moche as they are belevynge and beloved and partakers of the benefite .
54006003	These thynges teache and exhorte . Yf eny man teache other wise and is not contet with ye wholsome wordes of oure lorde Iesu christ and with the doctryne of godlines
54006004	he is pufte vp and knoweth nothynge : but wasteth his braynes aboute questions and stryfe of wordes wherof sprynge envie stryfe raylinges evyll surmysinges
54006005	and vayne disputacions of men with corrupte myndes and destitute of the trueth which thynke that lucre is godlines . From soche seperate thy silfe .
54006006	Godlines is great ryches yf a man be content with that he hath .
54006007	For we brought nothynge into the worlde and it is a playne case that we can cary nothynge out .
54006008	When we have fode and rayment let vs therwith be contet .
54006009	They that wilbe ryche faule into temptacio and snares and into many folysshe and noysome lustes which droune me in perdicion and destruccion .
54006010	For coveteousnes is the rote of all evyll which whill some lusted after they erred fro the fayth and tanglyd them selves with many sorowes .
54006011	But thou which arte the man of god flye soche thynges Folowe rightewesnes godlines love pacience and meknes .
54006012	Fyght ye good fyght of fayth . Laye honde on eternall lyfe where vnto thou arte called and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses .
54006013	I geve the charge in the sight of God which quickneth all thinges and before Iesu Christ which vnder Pocius Pilate witnessed a good witnessinge
54006014	yt thou kepe the comaundemet and be with out spotte and vnrebukeable vntyll the apperynge of oure lorde Iesus Christ
54006015	which aperynge ( when the tyme ys come ) he shall shewe that is blessed and myghty only kynge of kynges and lorde of lordes
54006016	which only hath immortalite and dwelleth in light that no man can attayne whom never man sawe nether can se : vnto whom be honoure and rule everlastynge . Amen .
54006017	Charge them that are ryche in this worlde that they be not excedynge wyse and that they trust not in the vncertayne ryches but in the livynge god which geveth vs aboundantly all thynges to enioye them
54006018	and that they do good and be ryche in good workes and redy to geve and to distribute
54006019	layinge vp in store for them selves a good foundacio agaynst the tyme to come yt they maye obteyne eternall lyfe
54006020	O Timothe save that which is geve ye to kepe and avoyde vngostly vanities of voyces and opposicios of sciece falsly so called
54006021	which sciece whyll some professed they have erred as concernynge the fayth . Grace be with the Amen .
55001001	Paul an Apostle of Iesu Christ by the will of God to preache the promes of lyfe which lyfe is in Christ Iesu .
55001002	To Timothe his beloved sonne . Grace mercy and peace from God the father and from Christ Iesu oure Lorde .
55001003	I thanke god whom I serve from myne elders with pure consciece that with out ceasynge I make mencion of the in my prayres nyght and daye
55001004	desyrynge to se the myndfull of thy teares : so that I am filled with ioye
55001005	whe I call to remembraunce the vnfayned fayth that is in the which dwelt fyrst in thy graumoder Lois and in thy mother Eunica : and am assured that it dwelleth in the also .
55001006	Wherfore I warne the that thou stere vp the gyfte of god which is in the by the puttynge on of my hondes .
55001007	For god hath not geven to vs the sprete of feare : but of power and of love and of sobrenes of mynde .
55001008	Be not a shamed to testyfye oure lorde nether be a shamed of me which am bounde for his sake : but suffre adversite with ye gospell also thorow ye power of god
55001009	which saved vs and called vs wt an holy callinge not acordinge to oure dedes but accordynge to his awne purpose and grace which grace was geve vs thorowe Christ Iesu before the worlde was
55001010	but is nowe declared openly by ye appearynge of oure savioure Iesu Christ which hath put away derth and hath brought lyfe and immortalite vnto light thorow the gospell
55001011	whervnto I am apoynted a preacher and an Apostle and a teacher of the gentyls :
55001012	for the which cause I also suffre these thinges . Neverthelesse I am not a shamed For I knowe who I have beleved and am sure that he is able to kepe that which I have comitted to his kepynge agaynst that daye .
55001013	Se thou have the ensample of the holsome wordes which thou heardest of me in fayth and love which is in Iesu Christ .
55001014	That good thinge whiche was committed to thy kepynge kepe in ye holy goost which dwelleth in vs .
55001015	This thou knowest how that all they which are in Asia be turned from me . Of which sorte are Phigelos and hermogenes .
55001016	The lorde geve mercie vnto the housse of Onesiphoros for he ofte refresshed me and was not a shamed of my chayne :
55001017	but when he was at Rome he sought me out very diligently and founde me .
55001018	The lorde graunt vnto him that he maye fynde mercie with the lorde at that daye . And in how many thynges he ministred vnto me at Ephesus thou knowest very wel .
55002001	Thou therfore my sonne be stronge in the grace that is in Christ Iesu .
55002002	And what thynges thou hast hearde of me many bearynge witnes the same diliver to faythfull men which are apte to teache other
55002003	Thou therfore suffre affliccion as a good soudier of Iesu Christ .
55002004	No man that warreth entanglith him silfe with worldely busynes and that be cause he wolde please him that hath chosen him to be a soudier .
55002005	And though a man strive for a mastery yet ys he not crouned except he strive laufully .
55002006	The husbandma that laboreth must fyrst receave of the frutes .
55002007	Consyder what I saye . The lorde geve the vnderstondynge in all thynges .
55002008	Remember that Iesus Christ beynge of he sede of David rose agayne fro deth accordynge to my gospell
55002009	wherin I suffre trouble as an evyll doar even vnto bondes . But the worde of god was not bounde .
55002010	Herefore I suffre all thinges for ye electes sakes that they myght also obtayne that saluacion which is in Christ Iesu with eternall glory .
55002011	It is a true sayinge if we be deed wt him we also shall live with him .
55002012	Yf we be pacient we shall also raigne wt him . If we denye him he also shall denye vs .
55002013	Yf we beleve not yet abideth he faithfull . He cannot denye him silfe .
55002014	Of these thynges put them in remembraunce and testifie before the lorde that they stryve not about wordes which is to no proffet but to pervert the hearers .
55002015	Study to shewe thy silfe laudable vnto god a workman yt nedeth not to be a shamed dividynge the worde of trueth iustly .
55002016	Vngostly and vayne voyces passe over . For they shall encreace vnto greater vngodlynes
55002017	and their wordes shall fret even as doeth a cancre : of whose nombre ys Hymeneos and Philetos
55002018	which as concernynge the trueth have erred sayinge that the resurreccion is past all redy and do destroye the fayth of divers persones .
55002019	But the sure grounde of god remayneth and hath this seale : the lorde knoweth them that are his and let every man that calleth on the name of Christ departe from iniquite .
55002020	Not withstondinge in a greate housse are not only vesselles of golde and of silver : but also of wood and of erthe some for honoure and some vnto dishonoure .
55002021	But Yf a man purdge him silfe from suche felowes he shalbe a vessell sanctified vnto honoure mete for the lorde and prepared vnto all good workes .
55002022	Lustes of youth avoyde and folowe rightwesnes fayth love and peace with them that call on the lorde with pure herte .
55002023	Folisshe and vnlearned questions put from the remebrynge that they do but gendre stryfe .
55002024	But the servaunt of the lorde must not stryve : but must be peasable vnto all men and apte to teache and one that can suffre :
55002025	the evyll in meknes and can informe them that resist yf that god at eny tyme will geve them repentauce for to knowe the trueth :
55002026	that they maye come to the selves agayne out of the snare of the devyll which are now taken of him at his will .
55003001	This understonde that in the last dayes shall come parelous tymes .
55003002	For the me shalbe lovers of their awne selves coveteous bosters proude cursed speakers disobediet to father and mother vnthakfull vnholy
55003003	vnkinde trucebreakers stubborn falce accusars ryatours fearce despisers of the which are good
55003004	traytours heddy hye mynded gredy apon volupteousnes more then the lovers of god
55003005	havynge a similitude of godly lyvynge but have denyed the power ther of and soche abhorre .
55003006	Of this sorte are they which entre in to houses and brynge into bondage wymmen laden with synne which wemen are ledde of divers lustes
55003007	ever learnynge and never able to come vnto the knowledge of the trueth .
55003008	As Iannes and Iambres withstode Moses even so do these resist the trueth men they are of corrupt myndes and leawde as concernynge the fayth :
55003009	but they shall prevayle no leger . For their madnes shalbe vttered vnto all men as theirs was .
55003010	But thou hast sene ye experience of my doctrine fassion of lyuynge purpose fayth longe sufferynge love pacience
55003011	persecucions and affliccions which happened vnto me at Antioche at Iconium and at lystra : which persecucions I suffered paciently . And from them all the lorde delivered me .
55003012	Ye and all that will live godly in Christ Iesu must suffre persecucions .
55003013	But the evyll men and disceavers shall wexe worsse and worsse whill they deceave and are deceaved them selves .
55003014	But continue thou in the thynges which thou hast learned which also were committed vnto the seynge thou knowest of whom thou hast learned them
55003015	and for as moche also as thou hast knowe holy scripture of a chylde which is able to make the wyse vnto saluacion thorowe the fayth which ys in Christ Iesu .
55003016	For all scripture geve by inspiracion of god is proffitable to teache to improve to amende and to instruct in rightewesnes
55003017	yt ye man of god maye be perfect and prepared vnto all good workes .
55004001	I testifie therfore before god and before the lorde Iesu Christ which shall iudge quicke and deed at his aperynge in his kyngdom
55004002	preache the worde be fervent be it in season or out of season . Improve rebuke exhorte with all longe sufferinge and doctryne .
55004003	For the tyme will come when they wyll not suffer wholsome doctryne : but after their awne lustes shall they ( whose eares ytche ) gett the an heepe of teachers
55004004	and shall turne their eares from ye trueth and shalbe geven vnto fables .
55004005	But watch thou in all thynges and suffre adversitie and do the worke of an evangelist fulfill thyne office vnto the vtmost .
55004006	For I am now redy to be offered and the tyme of my departynge is at honde .
55004007	I have fought a good fight and have fulfilled my course and have kept the fayth .
55004008	From hence forth is layde vp for me a croune of rightewesnes which the lorde that is a righteous iudge shall geve me at that daye : not to me only but vnto all them that love his commynge .
55004009	Make spede to come vnto me at once .
55004010	For Demas hath left me and hath loved this present worlde and is departed into Tessalonica . Crescens is gone to Galacia and Titus vnto Dalmacea .
55004011	Only Lucas is with me . Take Marke and bringe him with the for he is necessary vnto me forto minister .
55004012	And Tichicus have I sent to Ephesus .
55004013	The cloke that I lefte at Troada with Carpus whe thou commest brynge with the and the bokes but specially the partchemet .
55004014	Alexander the coppersmyth did me moche evyll the lorde rewarde him accordynge to his dedes
55004015	of whom be thou ware also . For he withstode oure preachynge sore .
55004016	At my fyrst answerynge no man assissted me but all forsoke me . I praye God that it maye not be layde to their charges :
55004017	notwithstondinge the Lorde assisted me and stregthed me that by me the preachinge shuld be fulfilled to the vtmost and that all the gentyls shuld heare . And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lyon .
55004018	And the Lorde shall delivre me from all evyll doynge and shall kepe me vnto his hevenly kyngdome . To who be prayse for ever and ever . Amen .
55004019	Salute Prisca and Aquila and the housholde of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus abode at Corinthu . Trophimos I lefte at Miletum sicke .
55004021	Make spede to come before winter . Eubolus gretith the and Pudes and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren .
55004022	The Lorde Iesus Christ be with thy sprete . Grace be with you . Amen .
56001001	Paul the seruaunt of God and an Apostle of Iesu Christ to preache the fayth of goddis electe and ye knowledge of that trueth which is after godlynes
56001002	vpon the hope of eternall lyfe which lyfe God that cannot lye hath promised before the worlde begane :
56001003	but hath opened his worde at ye tyme apoynted thorow preachynge which preachynge is committed vnto me by the commaundement of god oure saveoure .
56001004	To Titus his naturall sonne in the commen fayth . Grace mercie and peace from God the father and from the lord Iesu Christ oure saveoure .
56001005	For this cause left I ye in Creta that thou shuldest performe that which was lackynge and shuldest ordeyne elders in every citie as I apoynted the .
56001006	Yf eny be fautelesse the husbande of one wyfe havynge faythfull childre which are not selandred of royote nether are disobediet .
56001007	For a bisshoppe must be fautelesse as it be commeth the minister of God : not stubborne not angrye no dronkarde no fyghter not geven to filthy lucre :
56001008	but herberous one that loveth goodnes sobre mynded righteous holy temperat
56001009	and suche as cleveth vnto the true worde of doctryne that he maye be able to exhorte with wholsom learnynge and to improve them that saye agaynst it .
56001010	For ther are many disobedient and talkers of vanite and disceavers of myndes namely they of the circumcisio
56001011	whose mouthes must be stopped which pervert whole houses teachinge thinges which they ought not because of filthy lucre .
56001012	One beynge of the selves which was a poyet of their awne sayde : The Cretayns are all wayes lyars evyll beastes and slowe belies .
56001013	This witnes is true wherfore rebuke them sharply that they maye be sounde in the fayth
56001014	and not takynge hede to Iewes fables and commaudmentes of men that turne from the trueth .
56001015	Vnto the pure are all thynges pure : but vnto them that are defiled and vnbelevynge is nothynge pure : but even the very myndes and consciences of them are defiled .
56001016	They confesse that they knowe god : but with the dedes they denye hym and are abhominable and disobedient and vnto all good workes discommendable .
56002001	But speake thou that which becometh wholsome learninge .
56002002	That ye elder me be sober honest discrete sounde in the fayth in love and in paciece .
56002003	And ye elder weme lykewyse that they be in soche rayment as becommeth holynes not falce accusars not geven to moche drinkynge but teachers of honest thynges
56002004	to make the younge wemen sobremynded to love their husbandes to love their children
56002005	to be discrete chast huswyfly good and obediet vnto their awne husbandes that the worde of god be not evyll spoken of .
56002006	Yonge men lykwyse exhorte that they be sobre mynded .
56002007	Above all thynges shewe thy silfe an insample of good workes with uncorrupt doctryne with honestie and with the wholsome
56002008	worde which cannot be rebuked that he which withstondeth maye be a shamed havynge no thinge in you yt he maye disprayse .
56002009	The servautes exhorte to be obediet vnto their awne masters and to please in all thynges not answerynge agayne
56002010	nether be pickers but that they shewe all good faythfulnes that they maye do worshippe to ye doctryne of oure saveoure God in all thynges .
56002011	For the grace of god that bryngeth saluacion vnto all men hath appered
56002012	and teacheth vs that we shuld denye vngodlynes and wordly lustes and that we shuld live sobre mynded righteously and godly in this present worlde
56002013	lokinge for that blessed hope and glorious apperenge of ye myghty god and of oure savioure Iesu Christ
56002014	which gave him silfe for vs to redeme vs from all vnrightewesnes and to pourge vs a peculiar people vnto him silfe fervently geven vnto good workes .
56002015	These thinges speake and exhorte and rebuke with all commaundynge Se that no man despise the .
56003001	Warne the that they submitte them selves to rule and power to obey the officers that they be readie vnto all good workes
56003002	that they speake evyll of no ma that they be no fyghters but softe shewynge all meknes vnto all men .
56003003	For we oure selves also were in tymes past vnwyse disobedient deceaved in daunger to lustes and to diuers maners of volupteousnes livynge in maliciousnes and envie full of hate hatinge one another .
56003004	But after that the kyndnes and love of oure saveoure God to mawarde appered
56003005	not of ye dedes of rightewesnes which we wrought but of his mercie he saved vs by ye foutayne of the newe birth and with the renuynge of the holy goost
56003006	which he shed on vs aboundantly thorow Iesus Christ oure saveoure
56003007	that we once iustified by his grace shuld be heyres of eternall lyfe thorowe hope
56003008	This is a true sayinge . Of these thinges I wolde thou shuldest certifie that they which beleve God myght be diligent to go forwarde in good workes . These thinges are good and proffitable vnto me .
56003009	Folisshe questions and genealogies and braulinges and stryfe aboute the lawe avoyde for they are vnproffitable and superfluous .

57001004	I thake my God makinge mencio all wayes of the in my prayers
57001005	when I heare of thy love and fayth which thou hast towarde the Lorde Iesu and towarde all saynctes :
57001006	so that the fellisshippe that thou hast in the fayth is frutefull thorow knowledge of all good thinges which are in you by Iesus Christ .

57001008	Wherfore though I be bolde in Christ to enioyne the that which becometh the :
57001009	yet for loves sake I rather beseche the though I be as I am eve Paul aged and now in bondes for Iesu Christes sake .
57001010	I beseche the for my sonne Onesimus whom I begat in my bondes
57001011	which in tyme passed was to the vnproffetable : but now proffetable bothe to the and also to me

57001015	Haply he therfore departed for a season yt thou shuldest receave him for ever

58001001	God in tyme past diversly and many wayes spake vnto the fathers by Prophetes :
58001002	but in these last dayes he hath spoken vnto vs by his sonne whom he hath made heyre of all thinges : by who also he made the worlde .
58001003	Which sonne beynge the brightnes of his glory and very ymage of his substance bearinge vp all thinges with the worde of his power hath in his awne person pourged oure synnes and is sitten on the right honde of the maiestie an hye
58001004	and is more excellent then the angels in as moche as he hath by inheritaunce obteyned an excellenter name then have they .
58001005	For vnto which of the angels sayde he ateny tyme : Thou arte my sonne this daye be gate I the ? And agayne : I will be his father and he shalbe my sonne .
58001006	And agayne whe he bringeth in the fyrst begotten sonne in to the worlde he sayth : And all the angels of God shall worshippe him .
58001007	And of the angels he sayth : He maketh his angels spretes and his ministres flammes of fyre .
58001008	But vnto the sonne he sayth : God thy seate shalbe forever and ever . The cepter of thy kyngdome is a right cepter .
58001009	Thou hast loved rightewesnes and hated iniquyte . Wherfore God which is thy God hath anoynted the with ye oyle of gladnes above thy felowes .
58001010	And thou Lorde in the begynninge hast layde the foundacion of the erth . And the heves are the workes of thy hondes .
58001011	They shall perisshe but thou shalt endure . They all shall wexe olde as doth a garment :
58001012	and as a vesture shalt thou chaunge them and they shalbe chaunged . But thou arte all wayes and thy yeres shall not fayle .
58001013	Vnto which of the angels sayde he at eny tyme ? Sit on my ryght honde tyll I make thyne enemyes thy fote stole .
58001014	Are they not all mynistrynge spretes sent to minister for their sakes which shalbe heyres of salvacion ?
58002001	Wherfore we ought to geve ye more hede to ye thinges we have herde lest we perysshe .
58002002	For yf the worde which was spoke by angels was stedfast : so yt every trasgressio and disobediece receaved a iust recopece to rewarde :
58002003	how shall we escape yf we despyse so great saluacio which at ye fyrst bega to be preached of ye lorde him silfe and afterwarde was cofermed vnto vs warde by the ye hearde it
58002004	god bearynge witnes therto bothe with sygnes and wonders also and with divers miracles and gyftes of the holy gooste accordynge to his awne will .
58002005	He hath not vnto the angels put in subieccion the worlde to come where of we speake .
58002006	But one in a certayne place witnessed sayinge . What is man that thou arte myndfull of him ?
58002007	After thou haddest for a season made him lower then the angels : thou crounedst him with honour and glory and hast set him above the workes of thy hondes .
58002008	Thou hast put all thynges in subieccion vnder his fete . In that he put all thynges vnder him he left nothynge that is not put vnder him .
58002009	Neverthelesse we yet se not all thynges subdued but him yt was made lesse the ye angelles : we se that it was Iesus which is crouned with glory and honour for the sofferinge of death : that he by the grace of god shulde tast of deeth for all men .
58002010	For it becam him for whom are all thynges and by whom are all thynges after that he had brought many sonnes vnto glory that he shuld make the lorde of their saluacion parfect thorow sofferynge .
58002011	For he that sanctifieth and they which are sanctified are all of one . For which causes sake he is not ashamde to call the brethren
58002012	sayinge : I will declare thy name vnto my brethren and in the myddes of the congregacio will I prayse the .
58002013	And agayne : I will put my trust in him . And agayne . beholde here am I and the children which god hath geven me .
58002014	For as moche then as the children were parte takers of flesshe and bloud he also him silfe lyke wyse toke parte with them for to put doune thorow deth him that had lordshippe over deeth that is to saye the devyll
58002015	and yt he myght delyver the which thorow feare of deeth were all their lyfetyme in dauger of bondage .
58002016	For he in no place taketh on him the angels : but the seede of Abraham taketh he on him .
58002017	Wherfore in all thynges it became him to be made lyke vnto his brethre that he myght be mercifull and a faythfull hye preste in thynges concernynge god for to pourge the peoples synnes .
58002018	For in that he him silfe suffered and was tempted he is able to sucker them that are tempted .
58003001	Wherfore holy brethren partakers of the celestiall callinge cosyder the embasseatour and hye prest of oure profession Christ Iesus
58003002	which was faythfull to him that made him even as was Moses in all his housse .
58003003	And this man was counted worthy of more glory then Moses : In as moche as he which hath prepared the housse hath most honoure in the housse .
58003004	Every housse is prepared of some man . But he that ordeyned all thinges is god .
58003005	And Moses verely was faythfull in all his housse as a minister to beare witnes of tho thinges which shuld be spoken afterwarde .
58003006	But Christ as a sonne hath rule over the housse whose housse are we so that we hold fast the confydence and the reioysynge of that hope vnto the ende .
58003007	Wherfore as the holy goost sayth : to daye if ye shall heare his voyce
58003008	harden not youre hertes after the rebellyon in the daye of temptacion in the wildernes
58003009	where youre fathers tempted me proved me and sawe my workes xl . yeare longe .
58003010	Wherfore I was greved wt ye generacio and sayde . They erre ever in their hertes : they verely have not knowe my wayes
58003011	so that I sware in my wrathe that they shuld not enter into my rest .
58003012	Take hede brethren that therbe in none of you an evyll herte in vnbeleve that he shuld departe from ye lyvynge god :
58003013	but exhorte one another dayly whill is it called to daye lest eny of you wexe harde herted thorow ye deceytfullnesse of sinne
58003014	We are partetakers of Christ yf we kepe sure vnto the ende the fyrst substance
58003015	so longe as it is sayd : to daye yf ye heare his voyce harde not youre hertes as when ye rebelled .
58003016	For some whe they hearde rebelled : howbe it not all yt ca out of Egypt vnder Moses .
58003017	But with who was he despleased . xl . yeares ? Was he not displeased with them that synned : whose carkases were overthorwen in the desert ?
58003018	To whom sware he that they shuld not enter into his rest : but vnto them that beleved not ?
58003019	And we se that they coulde not enter in because of vnbeleve .
58004001	Let vs feare therfore lest eny of vs forsakynge the promes of entrynge into his rest shulde seme to come behinde .
58004002	For vnto vs was it declared as well as vnto them . But it proffited not them that they hearde the worde because they which hearde it coupled it not with fayth .
58004003	But we which have beleved do enter into his rest as contrarywyse he sayde to the other : I have sworne in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest . And that spake he verely longe after that the workes were made and the foudacio of ye worlde layde .
58004004	For he spake in a certayne place of ye seveth daye on this wyse : And god did rest ye seventh daye fro all his workes .
58004005	And in this place agayne : They shall not come into my rest .
58004006	Seynge therfore it foloweth that some muste enter therinto and they to who it was fyrst preached entred not therin for vnbeleves sake .
58004007	Agayne he apoynteth in David a certayne present daye after so longe a tyme sayinge as it is rehearsed : this daye if ye heare his voyce be not harde herted .
58004008	For if Iosue had geven them rest then wolde he not afterwarde have spoke of another daye .
58004009	There remayneth therfore yet a rest to ye people of God .
58004010	For he yt is is entred into his rest doth cease from his awne workes as god did from his .
58004011	Let vs study therfore to entre into that rest lest eny man faule after the same ensample in to vnbelefe .
58004012	For the worde of god is quycke and myghty in operacion and sharper then eny two edged swearde : and entreth through even vnto the dividynge asonder of the soule and the sprete and of the ioyntes and the mary : and iudgeth the thoughtes and the intentes of the herte :
58004013	nether is there eny creature invisible in the sight of it . For all thynges are naked and bare vnto the eyes of him of who we speake .
58004014	Seynge then that we have a great hye prest whych is entred into heven ( I meane Iesus the sonne of God ) let vs holde oure profession .
58004015	For we have not an hye prest which can not have compassion on oure infirmities : but was in all poyntes tempted lyke as we are : but yet with out synne .
58004016	Let vs therfore goo boldely vnto the seate of grace that we maye receave mercy and fynde grace to helpe in tyme of nede .
58005001	For every hye prest that is taken from amoge men is ordeyned for men in thynges pertaynynge to god : to offer gyftes and sacryfyses for synne :
58005002	which can have compassion on the ignoraunt and on them that are out of the waye because that he him silfe also is compased with infirmitie :
58005003	For the which infirmities sake he is bounde to offer for synnes as well for hys awne parte as for the peoples .
58005004	And no man taketh honour vnto him silfe but he that is called of God as was Aaron .
58005005	Even so lykewise Christ glorified not him silfe to be made the hye prest : but he that sayde vnto him : thou arte my sonne this daye begat I the glorified him .
58005006	As he also in another place speaketh : Thou arte a prest for ever after the order of Melchisedech .
58005007	Which in the dayes of his flesshe did offer vp prayers and sup plicacions with stronge cryinge and teares vnto him that was able to save him from deeth : and was also hearde because of his godlines .
58005008	And though he were Goddes sonne yet learned he obediece by tho thynges which he suffered
58005009	and was made parfaite and the cause of eternall saluacion vnto all them that obey him :
58005010	and is called of God an hye prest after the order of Melchisedech .
58005011	Wherof we have many thynges to saye which are harde to be vttered : because ye are dull of hearinge .
58005012	For when as cocerninge ye tyme ye ought to be teachers yet have ye nede agayne that we teache you the fyrst principles of the worde of god : and are become soche as have nede of mylke and not of stronge meate :
58005013	For every man that is feed with mylke is inexperte in the worde of rightewesnes . For he is but a babe .
58005014	But stronge meate belongeth to them that are parfecte which thorow custome have their wittes exercised to iudge both good and evyll also .
58006001	Wherfore let vs leave ye doctryne pertayninge to the beginninge of a Christen man and let vs go vnto perfeccio and now no more laye the foundacio of repentaunce from deed workes and of fayth towarde God
58006002	of baptyme of doctryne and of layinge on of hondes and of resurreccion from deeth and of eternall iudgemet .
58006003	And so will we do yf God permitte .
58006004	For it is not possible yt they which were once lyghted and have tasted of the hevenly gyft and were become partetakers of the holy goost
58006005	and have tasted of the good worde of God and of the power of the worlde to come :
58006006	yf they faule shuld be renued agayne vnto repentaunce : for as moche as they have ( as concerninge them selves ) crucified the sonne of God a fresshe makynge a mocke of him .
58006007	For that erth which drinketh in the rayne wich cometh ofte vpon it and bringeth forth erbes mete for them that dresse it receaveth blessynge of god .
58006008	But that grounde which beareth thornes and bryars is reproved and is nye vnto cursynge : whose ende is to be burned .
58006009	Neverthelesse deare frendes we trust to se better of you and thynges which accompany saluacion though we thus speake .
58006010	For god is not vnrighteous that he shuld forget youre worke and laboure that procedeth of love which love shewed in his name which have ministred vnto the saynctes and yet minister
58006011	Yee and we desyre that every one of you shew the same diligence to the stablysshynge of hope even vnto the ende :
58006012	that ye faynt not but folowe them which thorow fayth and pacience inheret the promyses .
58006013	For when god made promes to Abraham because he had no greater thinge to sweare by he sware by him silfe
58006014	sayinge : Surely I will blesse the and multiply the in dede .
58006015	And so after that he had taryed a longe tyme he enioyed the promes .
58006016	Men verely sweare by him that is greater then them selves and an othe to confyrme the thynge ys amonge them an ende of all stryfe .
58006017	So god willynge very aboundanly to shewe vnto the heyres of promes the stablenes of his counsayle he added an othe
58006018	that by two immutable thinges ( in which it was vnpossible that god shuld lye ) we myght have parfect consolacion which have fled for to holde fast the hope that is set before vs
58006019	which hope we have as an ancre of the soule both sure and stedfast . Which hope also entreth in into tho thynges which are with in the vayle
58006020	whither ye fore runner is for vs entred in I mea Iesus that is made an hye prest for ever after the order of Melchisedech .
58007001	This Melchisedech kynge of Salem ( which beinge prest of ye most hye god met Abraham as he returned agayne from the slaughter of the kynges and blessed him :
58007002	to whom also Abraham gave tythes of all thynges ) fyrst is by interpretacion kynge of rightewesnes : after yt he is kynge of Sale yt is to saye kynge of peace
58007003	with out father wt out mother with out kynne and hath nether begynnynge of his tyme nether yet ende of his lyfe : but is lykened vnto the sonne of god and cotinueth a preste for ever .
58007004	Consyder what a man this was vnto who the patriarke Abraham gave tythes of the spoyles .
58007005	And verely those children of levy which receave the office of the prestes have a commaundement to take a cordyng to the lawe tythes of the people that is to saye of their brethren yee though they spronge out of the loynes of Abraham .
58007006	But he whose kynred is not counted amonge them receaved tythes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promyses .
58007007	And no man denyeth but that which is lesse receaveth blessinge of yt which is greater .
58007008	And here men that dye receave tythes . But there he receaveth tythes of whom it is witnessed that he liveth .
58007009	And to saye the trueth Levy him silfe also which receaveth tythes payed tythes in Abraham .
58007010	For he was yet in the loynes of his father Abraham when Melchisech met him .
58007011	Yf now therfore perfeccion came by the presthod of the levites ( for vnder that presthod the people recaved the lawe ) what neded it furthermore that an other prest shuld ryse after the order of Melchisedech and not after the order of Aaron ?
58007012	Now no dout yf the presthod be translated then of necessitie must the lawe be translated also .
58007013	For he of whom these thynges are spoken pertayneth vnto another trybe of which never man served at the aultre .
58007014	For it is evidet that oure lorde spronge of the trybe of Iuda of which trybe spake Moses nothynge concernynge presthod .
58007015	And it is yet a more evydent thinge yf after the similitude of Melchisedech ther aryse a nother prest
58007016	which is not made after the lawe of the carnall commaundmet : but after the power of the endlesse lyfe
58007017	( For he testifieth : Thou arte a prest forever after the order of Melchysedech )
58007018	Then the commaundmet that went a fore is disanulled because of hir weaknes and vnproffitablenes .
58007019	For the lawe made nothynge parfecte : but was an introduccion of a better hope by which hope we drawe nye vnto god .
58007020	And for this cause it is a better hope that it was not promysed with out an othe .
58007021	Those prestes were made wt out an oth : but this prest with an oth by him that saide vnto him The lorde sware and will not repent : Thou arte a prest for ever after the order of Melchisedech .
58007022	And for that cause was Iesus a stablyssher of a better testament .
58007023	And amonge them many were made prestes because they were not suffred to endure by the reason of deeth .
58007024	But this man because he endureth ever hath an everlastinge presthod .
58007025	Wherfore he is able also ever to save them that come vnto god by him seynge he ever lyveth to make intercession for vs .
58007026	Soche an hye prest it became vs to have which is wholy harmlesse vndefyled separat from synners and made hyar then heven .
58007027	Which nedeth not dayly ( as yonder hie prestes ) to offer vp sacrifice fyrst for his awne synnes and then for the peoples synnes . For that did he at once for all when he offered vp him silfe .
58007028	For the lawe maketh men prestes which have infirmitie : but the worde of the othe that came fence ye lawe maketh the sonne prest which is parfecte for ever more .
58008001	Of the thynges which we have spoke this is the pyth : that we have soche an hye preste that is sitten on ye right honde of the seate of maieste in heven
58008002	and is a minister of holy thynges and of the very tabernacle which God pyght and not ma .
58008003	For every hye prest is ordeyned to offer gyftes and sacryfises wherfore it is of necessitie that this man have somewhat also to offer .
58008004	For he were not a preste yf he were on ye erth where are prestes that acordynge to ye lawe
58008005	offer giftes which prestes serve vnto ye ensample and shadowe of hevenly thynges : even as the answer of God was geven vnto Moses when he was about to fynnishe the tabernacle : Take hede ( sayde he ) that thou make all thynges accordynge to the patrone shewed to the in the mount .
58008006	Now hath he obtayned a more excellent office in as moche as he is the mediator of a better testament which was made for better promyses .
58008007	For yf that fyrst testament had bene fautelesse : then shuld no place have bene sought for the seconde .
58008008	For in rebukynge the he sayth : Beholde the dayes will come ( sayth the lorde ) and I will fynnyshe apon the housse of Israhel and apon the housse of Iuda
58008009	a newe testament : not lyke the testament that I made with their fathers at that tyme whe I toke them by the hondes to lede them oute of the londe of Egipte for they continued not in my testament and I regarded them not sayth the lorde .
58008010	For this is the testament that I will make with the housse of Israhell : After those dayes sayth the lorde : I will put my lawes in their myndes and in their hertes I will wryte the and I wilbe their God and they shalbe my people .
58008011	And they shall not teache every man his neghboure and every man his brother sayinge : knowe the lorde : For they shall knowe me from the lest to the moste of them :
58008012	For I wilbe mercifull over their vnrightwesnes and on their synnes and on their iniquiries .
58008013	In yt he sayth a new testament he hath abrogat the olde . Now that which is disanulled and wexed olde is redy to vannysshe awaye .
58009001	That fyrst tabernacle verely had ordinaunces and servynges of god and wordly holynes .
58009002	For there was a fore tabernacle made wherin was the candlesticke and the table and the shewe breed which is called wholy .
58009003	But with in the secode vayle was ther a tabernacle which is called holiest of all
58009004	which had the golden senser and the arcke of the testamet overlayde round about with golde wherin was the golden pot with manna and Aarons rodde that spronge and the tables of the testament .
58009005	Over the arcke were the cherubis of glory shadowynge the seate of grace . Of which thynges we wyll not now speake perticularly .
58009006	When these thynges were thus ordeyned the prestes went all wayes into the fyrst tabernacle and executed the service of god .
58009007	But into the seconde went the hye prest alone once every yeare : and not with out bloud which he offered for him silfe and for the ignoraunce of ye people .
58009008	Wherwith ye holy goost this signifyeng yt the waye of holy thynges was not yet opened whill as yet ye fyrst tabernacle was stondynge .
58009009	Which was a similitude for the tyme then present and in which were offered gyftes and sacrifises that coulde not make them that minister parfecte as pertaynynge to the conscience
58009010	with only meates and drinkes and divers wesshynges and iustifyinges of the flesshe which were ordeyned vntyll the tyme of reformacion .
58009011	But Christ beynge an hye prest of good thynges to come came by a greater and a moare parfecte tabernacle not made with hondes : that is to saye not of this maner bildynge
58009012	nether by the bloud of gotes and calves : but by his awne bloud we entred once for all into the holy place and founde eternall redemcion .
58009013	For yf the bloud of oxen and of Gotes and the asshes of an heyfer whe it was sprynckled puryfied the vnclene as touchynge the purifiynge of the flesshe :
58009014	How moche more shall the bloud of Christ ( which thorow the eternall sprete offered him silfe with out spot to God ) pourdge youre consciences from deed workes for to serve the livynge god ?
58009015	And for this cause is he the mediator of ye newe testament that thorow deeth which chaunsed for the redempcion of those transgressions that were in ye fyrst testamet ) they which were called myght receave the promes of eternall inheritaunce .
58009016	For whersoever is a testament there must also be the deeth of him that maketh the testament .
58009017	For the testament taketh auctoritie when men are deed : For it is of no value as longe as he that made it is alive .
58009018	For which cause also nether that fyrst testament was ordeyned with out bloud .
58009019	For when all the commaundementes were redde of Moses vnto all the people he toke ye bloud of calves and of Gotes with water and purple woll and ysope and sprynkled both the boke and all the people
58009020	sayinge : this is the bloud of the testament which god hath apoynted vnto you .
58009021	Morover he sprenkled the tabernacle with bloud also and all the ministrynge vessels .
58009022	And almost all thynges are bye the lawe pourged with bloud and with out effusion of bloud is no remission .
58009023	It is then nede that the similitudes of hevenly thynges be purified with soche thynges : but the hevenly thynges them selves are purified with better sacrifises then are those .
58009024	For Christ is not entred into the holy places that are made with hondes which are but similitudes of true thynges : but is entred into very heven for to appere now in the syght of God for vs :
58009025	not to offer him silfe often as the hye prest entreth in to ye holy place every yeare with straunge bloud
58009026	for then must he have often suffered sence the worlde bega . But now in the ende of the worlde hath he appered once to put synne to flyght by the offerynge vp of him silfe .
58009027	And as it is apoynted vnto men that they shall once dye and then commeth the iudegement even
58009028	so Christ was once offered to take awaye the synnes of many and vnto them that loke for him shall he appeare agayne without synne vnto saluacion .
58010001	For the lawe which hath but the shadowe of good thynges to come and not the thynges in their awne fassion can never with ye sacryfises which they offer yere by yere continually make the comers thervnto parfayte .
58010002	For wolde not then those sacrifises have ceased to have bene offered because that the offerers once pourged shuld have had no moare conscieces of sinnes .
58010003	Neverthelesse in those sacrifises is ther mencion made of synnes every yeare .
58010004	For it is vnpossible that the bloud of oxen and of gotes shuld take awaye synnes .
58010005	Wherfore when he commeth into the worlde he sayth : Sacrifice and offeringe thou woldest not have : but a bodie hast thou ordeyned me .
58010006	In sacrifices and synne offerynges thou hast no lust .
58010007	Then I sayde : Lo I come in the chefest of the boke it is written of me that I shuld doo thy will o god .
58010008	Above when he had sayed sacrifice and offerynge and burnt sacrifices and synne offerynges thou woldest not have nether hast alowed ( which yet are offered by the lawe )
58010009	and then sayde : Lo I come to do thy will o god : he taketh awaye the fyrst to stablisshe the latter .
58010010	By the which will we are sanctified by the offeringe of the body of Iesu Christe once for all .
58010011	And every prest is redy dayly ministrynge and ofte tymes offereth one maner of offerynge which can never take awaye synnes .
58010012	But this man after he had offered one sacrifyce for synnes sat him doune for ever on the right honde of god
58010013	and from hence forth tarieth till his foes be made his fotestole .
58010014	For with one offerynge hath he made parfecte for ever them yt are sanctified .
58010015	And ye holy goost also beareth vs recorde of this even when he tolde before :
58010016	This is the testament that I will make vnto them after those dayes sayth the lorde . I will put my lawes in their hertes and in their mynde I will write them
58010017	and their synnes and iniquyties will I remember no moare .
58010018	And where remission of these thinges is there is no moare offerynge for synne .
58010019	Seynge brethren that by the meanes of the bloud of Iesu we maye be bolde to enter into that holy place
58010020	by the newe and livynge waye which he hath prepared for vs through the vayle that is to saye by his flesshe .
58010021	And seynge also that we have an hye prest which is ruler over ye housse of god
58010022	let vs drawe nye with a true herte in a full fayth sprynckeled in oure hertes from an evyll conscience and wesshed in oure bodies with pure water
58010023	and let vs kepe the profession of oure hope with oute waveringe ( for he is faythfull that promysed )
58010024	and let vs consyder one another to provoke vnto love and to good workes :
58010025	and let vs not forsake the felishippe that we have amoge oure selves as the maner of some is : but let vs exhorte one another and that so moche the more because ye se that the daye draweth nye .
58010026	For yf we synne willyngly after that we have receaved the knowledge of the trueth there remayneth no more sacrifice for synnes
58010027	but a fearfull lokynge for iudgement and violent fyre which shall devoure the adversaries
58010028	He that despiseth Moses lawe dyeth with out mercy vnder two or thre witnesses .
58010029	Of how moche sorer punyshment suppose ye shall he be counted worthy which treadeth vnderfote the sonne of god : and counteth the bloude of the testament as an vnholy thynge wherwith he was sanctified and doth dishonoure to the sprete of grace .
58010030	For we knowe him that hath sayde vengeaunce belongeth vnto me I will recompence sayth the lorde . And agayne : the lorde shall iudge his people .
58010031	It is a fearfull thynge to faule into the hondes of the livynge God .
58010032	Call to remebraunce the dayes that are passed in the which after ye had receaved light ye endured a greate fyght in adversities
58010033	partly whill all men wondred and gased at you for the shame and trioulacion that was done vnto you and partly whill ye became companyons of the which so passed their tyme .
58010034	For ye suffered also with my bondes and toke a worth the spoylynge of youre goodes and that with gladnes knowynge in youre selves how that ye had in heven a better and an endurynge substaunce
58010035	Cast not awaye therfore youre confidence which hath great rewarde to recopence .
58010036	For ye have nede of paciece that after ye have done ye will of god ye myght receave the promes .
58010037	For yet a very lytell whyle and he that shall come will come and will not tary .
58010038	But the iust shall live by faith . And yf he withdrawe him silfe my soule shall have no pleasure in him .
58010039	We are not whiche withdrawe oure selves vnto dampnacio but partayne to fayth to the wynnynge of the soule .
58011001	Fayth is a sure confidence of thynges which are hoped for and a certayntie of thynges which are not sene .
58011002	By it ye elders were well reported of .
58011003	Thorow fayth we vnderstonde that the worlde was ordeyned by the worde of god : and that thynges which are sene were made of thynges which are not sene .
58011004	By fayth Abell offered vnto god a more plenteous sacrifice then Cayn : by which he obteyned witnes that he was righteous god testifyinge of his gyftes : by which also he beynge deed yet speaketh .
58011005	By fayth was Enoch traslated yt he shuld not se deeth : nether was he founde : for God had taken him awaye . Before he was taken awaye he was reported of that he had pleased God :
58011006	but with out fayth it is vnpossible to please him . For he that commeth to God must beleve that God is and that he is a rewarder of them that seke him .
58011007	By fayth Noe honored God after that he was warned of thinges which were not sene and prepared the arcke to the savinge of his houssholde thorowe the which arcke he condempned the worlde and became heyre of the rightewesnes which commeth by fayth .
58011008	By fayth Abraha whe he was called obeyed to goo out into a place which he shuld afterwarde receave to inheritaunce and he wet out not knowynge whether he shuld goo .
58011009	By fayth he removed into the londe yt was promysed him as into a straunge countre and dwelt in tabernacles : and so dyd Isaac and Iacob heyres with him of the same promes .
58011010	For he loked for a citie havinge a foundacio whose bylder and maker is God .
58011011	Thorow fayth Sara also receaved stregth to be with chylde and was delivered of a chylde when she was past age because she iudged him faythfull which had promysed .
58011012	And therfore spronge therof one ( and of one which was as good as deed ) so many in multitude as the starres of ye skye and as the sond of the see shore which is innumerable .
58011013	And they all dyed in fayth and receaved not the promyses : but sawe them a farre of and beleved them and saluted them : and confessed that they were straungers and pilgrems on the erthe .
58011014	They that saye soche thinges declare that they seke a coutre .
58011015	Also yf they had bene myndfull of that countre from whence they came oute they had leasure to have returned agayne .
58011016	But now they desyre a better that is to saye a hevenlye . Wherfore God is not ashamed of them even to be called their God : for he hath prepared for them a citie .
58011017	In fayth Abraham offered vp Isaac whe he was tempted and he offered him beinge his only begotten sonne which had receaved the promyses
58011018	of who it was sayde in Isaac shall thy seed be called :
58011019	for he cosidered that God was able to rayse vp agayne fro deeth . Wherfore receaved he him for an ensample .
58011020	In fayth Isaac blessed Iacob and Esau concerninge thinges to come .
58011021	By fayth Iacob when he was a dyinge blessed both the sonnes of Ioseph and bowed him selfe towarde the toppe of his cepter .
58011022	By fayth Ioseph when he dyed remebred the departinge of the chyldren of Israel and gave commaundement of his bones .
58011023	By fayth Moses when he was borne was hid thre monethes of his father and mother be cause they sawe he was a proper chylde : nether feared they the kynges commaundemet .
58011024	By fayth Moses when he was great refused to be called ye sonne of Pharaos doughter
58011025	and chose rather to suffre adversitie wt the people of God then to enioye the pleasurs of synne for a ceason
58011026	and estemed the rebuke of Christ greater ryches then the treasure of Egypt . For he had a respect vnto ye rewarde .
58011027	By fayth he forsoke Egypt and feared not the fearcenes of the kynge . For he endured even as he had sene him which is invisible .
58011028	Thorow fayth he ordeyned the ester lambe and the effusion of bloud lest he that destroyed the fyrst borne shuld touche them .
58011029	By fayth they passed thorow the reed see as by drye londe which when the Egypcians had assayed to do they were drouned .
58011030	By fayth the walles of Ierico fell doune after they were copased about seven dayes .
58011031	By fayth ye harlot Raab perisshed not with the vnbelevers whe she had receaved the spyes to lodgynge peaseably .
58011032	And what shall I more saye ye tyme wold be to short for me to tell of Gedeo of Barach and of Samson and of Iephthae : also of David and Samuel and of the Prophetes :
58011033	which thorowe fayth subdued kyngdomes wrought righteousnes obteyned the promyses stopped the mouthes of lyons
58011034	queched the violence of fyre escaped the edge of the swearde of weake were made stroge waxed valient in fight turned to flyght the armyes of the alientes .
58011035	And the wemen receaved their deed raysed to lyfe agayne . Other were racked and wolde not be delyvered that they myght receave a better resurreccion .
58011036	Other tasted of mockynges and scourginginges morover of bondes and presonmet :
58011037	were stoned were hewen a sunder were tepted were slayne with sweardes walked vppe and doune in shepes skynnes in gotes skynnes in nede tribulacio and vexacio
58011038	which ye worlde was not worthy of : they wadred in wildernes in moutaynes in dennes and caves of the erth .
58011039	And these all thorow fayth obtayned good reporte and receaved not the promes
58011040	God provydinge a better thinge for vs that they with out vs shuld not be made parfecte .
58012001	Wherfore let vs also ( seynge that we are copased with so great a multitude of witnesses ) laye awaye all that presseth doune and the synne that hageth on and let vs rune with paciece vnto the battayle yt is set before vs
58012002	lokynge vnto Iesus the auctor and fynnyssher of oure fayth which for the ioye that was set before him abode the crosse and despysed the shame and is set doune on the right honde of ye trone of God .
58012003	Consider therfore how that he endured suche speakinge agaynst him of synners lest ye shuld be weried and faynte in youre myndes .
58012004	For ye have not yet resisted vnto bloud sheddinge stryvinge agaynst synne .
58012005	And ye have forgotten the consolacion which speaketh vnto you as vnto chyldren : My sonne despyse not the chastenynge of the Lorde nether faynt when thou arte rebuked of him :
58012006	For whom the Lorde loveth him he chasteneth : yee and he scourgeth every sonne that he receaveth .
58012007	Yf ye endure chastninge God offereth him selfe vnto you as vnto sonnes . What sonne is that whom the father chasteneth not ?
58012008	If ye be not vnder correccio ( where of all are part takers ) then are ye bastardes and not sonnes .
58012009	Moreover seynge we had fathers of oure flesshe which corrected vs and we gave them reverence : shuld we not moche rather be in subieccion vnto the father of spretuall gyftes that we myght live ?
58012010	And they verely for a feaue dayes nurtred vs after their awne pleasure : but he learneth vs vnto that which is proffitable that we myght receave of his holines .
58012011	No manner chastisynge for the present tyme semeth to be ioyeous but greveous : neverthelesse afterwarde it bryngeth the quyet frute of rightewesnes vnto them which are therin exercysed .
58012012	Stretch forthe therfore agayne the hondes which were let doune and the weake knees
58012013	and se that ye have strayght steppes vnto youre fete lest eny haltinge turne out of ye waye : yee let it rather be healed .
58012014	Embrace peace with all men and holynes : with out the which no man shall se the Lorde .
58012015	And looke to that no man be destitue of the grace of God and that no rote of bitternes springe vp and trouble and therby many be defiled :
58012016	and that there be no fornicator or vnclene person as Esau which for one breakfast solde his birthright .
58012017	Ye knowe how that afterwarde when he wolde have inherited the blessinge he was put by and he foude no meanes to come therby agayne : no though he desyred it with teares .
58012018	For ye are not come vnto the mounte that can be touched and vnto burninge fyre nor yet to myst and darcknes and tempest of wedder
58012019	nether vnto the sounde of a trope and the voyce of wordes : which voyce they that hearde it wisshed awaye that the comunicacion shuld not be spoken to them .
58012020	For they were not able to abyde that which was spoken . If a beast had touched the mountayne it must have bene stoned or thrust thorowe with a darte :
58012021	eve so terreble was ye sight which appered . Moses sayde I feare and quake .
58012022	But ye are come vnto the moute Sion and to the citie of the livinge god the celestiall Ierusalem : and to an innumerable sight of angels
58012023	and vnto the congregacion of ye fyrst borne sonnes which are writte in heven and to God the iudge of all and to the spretes of iust and parfecte men
58012024	and to Iesus the mediator of the newe testament and to the spryncklynge of bloud that speaketh better then the bloud of Abell .
58012025	Se that ye despise not him yt speaketh . For yf they escaped not which refused him that spake on erth : moche more shall we not escape yf we turne awaye fro him yt speaketh fro heve :
58012026	whose voyce the shouke the erth and now declareth sayinge : yet once more will I shake not the erth only but also heven .
58012027	No dout yt same that he sayth yet once more signifieth the removinge a waye of those thinges which are shaken as of thinges which have ended their course : that the thynges which are not shaken maye remayne .
58012028	Wherfore if we receave a kyngdom which is not moved we have grace wherby we maye serve god and please him with reverence and godly feare .
58012029	For oure god is a consumynge fyre .
58013001	Let brotherly love continue .
58013002	Be not forgetfull to lodge straungers . For therby have dyvers receaved angels into their houses vnwares .
58013003	Remember them that are in bondes even as though ye were bounde with them . Be myndfull of them which are in adversitie as ye which are yet in youre bodies .
58013004	Let wedlocke be had in pryce in all poyntes and let the chamber be vndefiled : for whore kepers and advoutrars god will iudge .
58013005	Let youre conversacion be with out coveteousnes and be contet with that ye have all redy . For he verely sayd : I will not fayle the nether forsake the :
58013006	that we maye boldly saye : the lorde is my helper and I will not feare what man doeth vnto me .
58013007	Remember them which have the oversight of you which have declared vnto you the worde of god . The ende of whose conversacion se that ye looke vpon and folowe their fayth .
58013008	Iesus Christ yesterdaye and to daye and the same continueth for ever .
58013009	Be not caryed aboute with divers and straunge learnynge . For it is a good thynge that the herte be stablisshed with grace and not with meates which have not proffeted them that have had their pastyme in them .
58013010	We have an altre wherof they maye not eate which serve in the tabernacle .
58013011	For ye bodies of those beastes whose bloud is brought into the holy place by the hie prest to pourge sinne are burnt with out the tentes .
58013012	Therfore Iesus to sanctifye the people with his awne bloud suffered with out the gate .
58013013	Let vs goo forth therfore out of the tentes and suffer rebuke with him .
58013014	For here have we no continuynge citie : but we seke one to come .
58013015	For by him offer we the sacrifice of laude allwayes to god : that is to saye the frute of those lyppes which confesse his name .
58013016	To do good and to distribute forget not for with suche sacrifises god is pleased .
58013017	Obeye the that have the oversight of you and submit youre selves to them for they watch for youre soules even as they that must geve a comptes : that they maye do it with ioye and not with grefe . For that is an vnproffitable thynge for you .
58013018	Praye for vs . We have confidence because we have a good conscience in all thynges and desyre to live honestly .
58013019	I desire you therfore somwhat the moare aboundantly that ye so do that I maye be restored to you quyckly .
58013020	The god of peace that brought agayne fro deth oure lorde Iesus the gret shepperde of the shepe thorowe the bloud of the everlastynge testamet
58013021	make you parfect in all good workes to do his will workynge in you yt which is pleasaut in his syght thorow Iesus christ To whom be prayse for ever whill the worlde endureth Amen .
58013022	I beseche you brethren suffre the wordes of exhortacio : For we have written vnto you in feawe wordes :
58013023	knowe the brother Timothe whom we have sent fro vs with whom ( yf he come shortly ) I will se you .
58013024	Salute the that have the oversight of you and all the saynctes . They of Italy salute you .
58013025	Grace be with you all . Amen .
59001001	Iames the seruaut of God and of the Lorde Iesus Christ sendeth gretinge to ye . xii . trybes which are scattered here and there .
59001002	My brethren count it excedynge ioye when ye faule into divers teptacions
59001003	for as moche as ye knowe how that the tryinge of youre fayth bringeth pacience :
59001004	and let pacience have her parfect worke that ye maye be parfecte and sounde lackinge nothinge .
59001005	Yf eny of you lacke wysdome let him axe of God which geveth to all men indifferentlie and casteth no man in the teth : and it shal be geven him .
59001006	But let him axe in fayth and waver not . For he that douteth is lyke the waves of the see tost of the wynde and caried with violence .
59001007	Nether let that man thinke that he shall receave eny thinge of the Lorde .
59001008	A waveringe mynded man is vnstable in all his wayes .
59001009	Let the brother of lowe degre reioyce in yt he is exalted
59001010	and the ryche in that he is made lowe . For eve as ye flower of the grasse shall he vanysshe awaye .
59001011	The sonne ryseth with heate and the grasse wydereth and his flower falleth awaye and the beautie of the fassion of it perissheth : even so shall the ryche man perisshe with his aboundance .
59001012	Happy is the man that endureth in temptacion for when he is tryed he shall receave the croune of lyfe which the Lorde hath promysed to them that love him .
59001013	Let no man saye when he is tepted that he is tempted of God . For God tepteth not vnto evyll nether tepteth he anie ma .
59001014	But every ma is tepted drawne awaye and entysed of his awne concupiscece .
59001015	Then when lust hath coceaved she bringeth forth synne and synne whe it is fynisshed bringeth forthe deeth .
59001016	Erre not my deare brethren .
59001017	Every good gyfte and every parfayt gyft is from above and commeth doune fro the father of light with whom is no variablenes nether is he chaunged vnto darcknes .
59001018	Of his awne will begat he vs with the worde of lyfe that we shuld be the fyrst frutes of his creatures .
59001019	Wherfore deare brethren let every man be swyfte to heare slowe to speake and slowe to wrath .
59001020	For the wrath of man worketh not that which is ryghteous before God .
59001021	Wherfore laye a parte all fylthynes all superfluite of maliciousnes and receave with meknes the worde yt is grafted in you which is able to save youre soules .
59001022	And se that ye be doars of the worde and not hearers only deceavinge youre awne selves with sophistrie
59001023	For yf eny heare the worde and do it not he is lyke vnto a man that beholdeth his bodyly face in a glasse .
59001024	For assone as he hath loked on him silfe he goeth his waye and forgetteth immediatlie what his fassion was .
59001025	But who so loketh in the parfaict lawe of libertie and continueth ther in ( yf he be not a forgetfull hearer but a doar of ye worke ) the same shall be happie in his dede .
59001026	Yf eny man amonge you seme devoute and refrayne not his tonge : but deceave his awne herte this mannes devocion is in vayne
59001027	Pure devocion and vndefiled before God the father is this : to vysit the frendlesse and widdowes in their adversite and to kepe him silfe vnspotted of the worlde .
59002001	Brethren have not the fayth of oure lorde Iesus Christ the lorde of glory in respecte of persons .
59002002	Yf ther come into youre company a man with a golden rynge and in goodly aparell and ther come in also a poore man in vyle rayment
59002003	and ye have a respecte to him that weareth the gaye clothynge and saye vnto him . Sit thou here in a good place : and saye vnto the poore stonde thou there or sit here vnder my fotestole :
59002004	are ye not parciall in youre selves and have iudged after evyll thoughtes ?
59002005	Harken my deare beloved brethren . Hath not God chosen the poore of this worlde which are ryche in fayth and heyres of the kyngdom which he promysed to them that love him ?
59002006	But ye have despised the poore . Are not the rych they which opresse you : and they which drawe you before iudges ?
59002007	Do not they speake evyll of that good name after which ye be named .
59002008	Yf ye fulfill the royall lawe accordynge to the scripture which sayth . Thou shallt love thyne neghbour as thy silfe ye do well .
59002009	But yf ye regarde one person more then another ye commit synne and are rebuked of the lawe as transgressours .
59002010	Whosoever shall kepe the whole lawe and yet fayle in one poynt he is gyltie in all .
59002011	For he that sayd . Thou shallt not commit adulterie sayed also : thou shallt not kyll . Though thou do none adulterie yet yf thou kill thou arte a transgresser of the lawe .
59002012	So speake ye and so do as they that shalbe iudged by the lawe of libertie .
59002013	For ther shalbe iudgement merciles to him that sheweth no mercy and mercy reioyseth agaynst iudgement :
59002014	What a vayleth it my brethren though a man saye he hath sayth when he hath no dedes ? Can fayth save him ?
59002015	If a brother or a sister be naked or destitute of dayly fode
59002016	and one of you saye vnto them : Departe in peace God sende you warmnes and fode : not withstondinge ye geve the not tho thynges which are nedfull to the body : what helpeth it the ?
59002017	Eve so fayth yf it have no dedes is deed in it selfe .
59002018	Ye and a man myght saye : Thou hast fayth and I have dedes : Shewe me thy fayth by thy dedes : and I will shewe the my fayth by my dedes .
59002019	Belevest thou yt ther is one God ? Thou doest well . The devyls also beleve and tremble .
59002020	Wilt thou vnderstonde o thou vayne man that fayth with out dedes is deed ?
59002021	Was not Abraha oure father iustified thorow workes when he offered Isaac his sonne vpo the aultre ?
59002022	Thou seist how that fayth wrought with his dedes and through the dedes was the fayth made parfect :
59002023	and ye scripture was fulfilled which sayth : Abraham beleved God and it was reputed vnto him for rightewesnes : and he was called the frede of God .
59002024	Ye se then how that of dedes a man is iustified and not of fayth only .
59002025	Lyke wyse also was not Raab the harlot iustifyed thorow workes when she receaved the messengers and sent the out another waye ?
59002026	For as the body with oute the sprete is deed eve so fayth with out dedes is deed
59003001	My brethren be not every ma a master remembringe how that we shall receave the more damnacion :
59003002	for in many thinges we synne all . Yf a man synne not in worde the same is a parfecte ma and able to tame all the body .
59003003	Beholde we put bittes into ye horses mouthes that they shuld obeye vs and we turne aboute all the body .
59003004	Beholde also the shyppes which though they be so gret and are dryven of fearce windes yet are they turned about with a very smale helme whither soever the violence of the governer wyll .
59003005	Even so the tonge is a lyttell member and bosteth great thinges . Beholde how gret a thinge a lyttell fyre kyndleth
59003006	and the tonge is fyre and a worlde of wyckednes . So is the tonge set amonge oure members that it defileth the whole body and setteth a fyre all that we have of nature and is it selfe set a fyre even of hell .
59003007	All the natures of beastes and of byrdes and of serpentes and thinges of ye see are meked and tamed of the nature of man .
59003008	But the tonge can no man tame . Yt is an vntuely evyll full of deedly poyson .
59003009	Therwith blesse we God the father and therwith cursse we me which are made after the similitude of God .
59003010	Out of one mouth proceadeth blessynge and cursynge . My brethren these thinges ought not so to be .
59003011	Doth a fountayne sende forth at one place swete water and bytter also ?
59003012	Can the fygge tree my Brethren beare olive beries : other a vyne beare fygges ?
59003013	So can no fountayne geve bothe salt water and fresshe also . If eny man be wyse and endued with learnynge amonge you let him shewe the workes of his good conversacio in meknes that ys coupled with wisdome .
59003014	But Yf ye have bitter envyinge and stryfe in youre hertes reioyce not : nether be lyars agaynst the trueth .
59003015	This wisdome descedeth not from a boue : but is erthy and naturall and divelisshe .
59003016	For where envyinge and stryfe is there is stablenes and all maner of evyll workes .
59003017	But the wisdom that is from above is fyrst pure then peasable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good frutes without iudgynge and without simulacio :
59003018	yee and the frute of rightewesnes is sowen in peace of them that mayntene peace .
59004001	From whence commeth warre and fighttynge amonge you : come they not here hence ? even of youre volupteousnes that rayne in youre members .
59004002	Ye lust and have not . Ye envie and have indignacion and cannot obtayne . Ye fight and warre and have not because ye axe not .
59004003	Ye axe and receave not because ye axe a mysse : even to consume it apon youre volupteousnes .
59004004	Ye advouterars and wemen that breke matrimonie : knowe ye not how yt the freshippe of ye worlde is ennimite to god warde ? Whosoever wilbe a frende of the worlde is made the enemie of god .
59004005	Ether do ye thinke that the scripture sayth in vayne The sprite that dwelleth in you lusteth eve contrary to envie :
59004006	but geveth more grace .
59004007	Submit youre selves to god and resist the devyll and he will flye from you .
59004008	Drawe nye to god and he will drawe nye to you . Clense youre hondes ye synners and pourdge youre hertes ye waverynge mynded .
59004009	Suffre affliccios : sorowe ye and wepe . Let youre laughter be turned to mornynge and youre ioye to hevynes .
59004010	Cast doune youre selves before the lorde and he shall lift you vp .
59004011	Backbyte not one another brethren . He that backbyteh hys brother and he that iudgeth his brother backbyteth the lawe and iudgeth the lawe . But and yf thou iudge the lawe thou art not an observer of ye lawe : but a iudge .
59004012	Ther is one lawe gever which is able to save and to distroye . What art thou that iudgest another man ?
59004013	Go to now ye that saye : to daye and to morow let vs go into soche a citie and continue there a yeare and bye and sell and wynne :
59004014	and yet can not tell what shall happen to morowe . For what thynge is youre lyfe ? It is even a vapoure that apereth for a lytell tyme and the vanyssheth awaye :
59004015	For that ye ought to saye : yf the lorde will and yf we live let vs do this or that .
59004016	But nowe ye reioyce in youre bostinges . All soche reioysynge is evyll .
59004017	Therfore to him that knoweth how to do good and doth it not to him it is synne .
59005001	Goo to now ye ryche men . Wepe and howle on youre wretchednes that shall come apon you .
59005002	Youre ryches is corrupte youre garmentes are motheaten .
59005003	Youre golde and youre silver are cankred and the rust of them shalbe a witnes vnto you and shall eate youre flesshe as it were fyre . Ye have heaped treasure togedder in youre last dayes :
59005004	Beholde the hyre of ye labourers which have reped doune youre feldes ( which hyer is of you kept backe by fraude ) cryeth : and ye cryes of them which have reped are entred into the eares of the lorde Sabaoth .
59005005	Ye have lived in pleasure on the erth and in wantannes . Ye have norysshed youre hertes as in a daye of slaughter .
59005006	Ye have condempned and have killed the iust and he hath not resisted you .
59005007	Be pacient therfore brethren vnto the commynge of the lorde . Beholde the husbande man wayteth for the precious frute of the erth and hath longe pacience ther vppon vntill he receave ( the erly and the latter rayne . )
59005008	Be ye also pacient therfore and settle youre hertes for ye commynge of the lorde draweth nye .
59005009	Grodge not one agaynst another brethre lest ye be dapned . Beholde the iudge stondeth before the dore .
59005010	Take ( my brethren ) the prophettes for an ensample of sufferynge adversitie and of longe pacience which spake in the name of the lorde .
59005011	Beholde we counte them happy which endure . Ye have hearde of the pacience of Iob and have knowen what ende the lorde made . For the lorde is very pitifull and mercifull .
59005012	But above all thynges my brethre sweare not nether by heven nether by erth nether by eny other othe . Let youre ye be ye and youre maye naye : lest ye faule into ypocrecy .
59005013	Yf eny of you be evyll vexed let him praye . Yf eny of you be mery let him singe Psalmes .
59005014	Yf eny be defeated amonge you let him call for the elders of the congregacion and let the praye over him and anoynte him with oyle in the name of the lorde :
59005015	and the prayer of fayth shall save the sicke and the lorde shall rayse him vp : and yf he have committed synnes they shalbe forgeuen him .
59005016	knowledge youre fautes one to another : and praye one for another that ye maye be healed . The prayer of a ryghteous ma avayleth moche yf it be fervet .
59005017	Helias was a man mortall even as we are and he prayed in his prayer that it myght not rayne : and it rayned not on the erth by the space of thre yeares and sixe monethes .
59005018	And he prayed agayne and the heve gave rayne and the erth brought forth her frute .
59005019	Brethren yf eny of you erre from the trueth and an other convert him
59005020	let the same knowe that he which converted the synner fro goynge a straye out of his waye shall save a soule fro deeth and shall hyde ye multitude of synnes .
60001001	Peter an Apostle of Iesu Christ to them that dwell here and there as straungers thorowout Pontus Galacia Capadocia Asia and Bethinia electe
60001002	by ye forknowledge of God ye father thorow the sanctifyinge of the sprete vnto obedience and springklinge of the bloud of Iesus Christ . Grace be with you and peace be multiplyed .
60001003	Blessed be God ye father of oure Lorde Iesus Christ which thorow is aboundant mercie begat vs agayne vnto a lively hope by the resurreccion of Iesus Christ fro deeth
60001004	to enioye an inheritaunce immortall and vndefiled and that purifieth not reserved in heven for you
60001005	which are kept by the power of God thorow fayth vnto salvacion which salvacion is prepared all redy to be shewed in the last tyme
60001006	in the which tyme ye shall reioyce though now for a season ( if nede requyre ) ye are in hevines thorowe manifolde temptacions
60001007	that youre fayth once tried beinge moche more precious then golde yt perissheth ( though it be tried with fyre ) myght be founde vnto lawde glory and honoure at the apperinge of Iesus Christ :
60001008	who ye have not sene and yet love him in whom even now though ye se him not ye yet beleue and reioyce with ioye vnspeakable and glorious :
60001009	receavynge the ende of youre fayth the salvacion of youre soules .
60001010	Of which salvacion have the Prophetes enquyred and searched which prophisied of ye grace that shuld come vnto you
60001011	searchinge whe or at what tyme the sprete of Christ which was in them shuld signifie which sprete testified before the passions that shuld come vnto Christ and the glory that shuld folowe after :
60001012	vnto which Prophetes it was declared that not vnto them selves but vnto vs they shuld minister the thinges which are now shewed vnto you of them which by ye holy goost sent doune fro heven have preached vnto you the thinges which the angels desyre to beholde .
60001013	Wherfore gyrde vp ye loynes of youre myndes be sober and trust perfectly on the grace yt is brought vnto you by the declaringe of Iesus Christ
60001014	as obediet chyldre not facioninge youre selves vnto youre olde lustes of ignoracye :
60001015	but as he which called you is holy eve so be ye holy in all maner of conuersacion
60001016	because it is written . Be ye holy for I am holy .
60001017	And yf so be yt ye call on the father which with out respecte of person iudgeth accordinge to every manes worke se yt ye passe the tyme of youre pilgremage in feare .
60001018	For as moche as ye know how that ye were not redemed with corruptible sylver and golde from youre vayne conversacion which ye receaved by the tradicions of the fathers :
60001019	but with the precious bloud of Christ as of a lambe vndefiled and withouten spot
60001020	which was ordeyened before the worlde was made : but was declared in the last tymes for youre
60001021	sakes which by his meanes have beleved on god that raysed him from deth and glorified him that youre fayth and hope myght be in god .
60001022	And for as moche as ye have purified youre soules thorowe the sprete in obeyinge the trueth for to love brotherly withouten saynynge se that ye love one another with a pure hert fervently :
60001023	for ye are borne a newe not of mortall seed but of immortall by the worde of god which liveth and lasteth for ever .
60001024	For all flesshe is as grasse and all the glory of man is as the floure of grasse . The grasse widdereth and the flower falleth awaye
60001025	but the worde of the lorde endureth ever . And this is the worde which by the gospell was preached amonge you .
60002001	Wherfore laye asyde all maliciousnes and all gyle and dissimulacion and envie and all backbytynge :
60002002	and as newe borne babes desyre that reasonable mylke which is with out corrupcion that ye maye growe therin .
60002003	If so be that ye have tasted how plesaunt the lorde is
60002004	to whom ye come as vnto a livynge stone disalowed of men but chosen of god and precious :
60002005	and ye as lyvynge stones are made a spretuall housse and an holy presthode for to offer vp spretuall sacryfice acceptable to god by Iesus Christ .
60002006	Wherfore it is contayned in the scripture : beholde I put in Sion an heed corner stone electe and precious : and he that beleveth on him shall not be ashamed .
60002007	Vnto you therfore which beleve he is precious : but vnto them which beleve not ye stone which ye bylders refused ye same is made ye heed stone in the corner
60002008	and a stone to stomble at and a rocke to offende them which stomble at the worde and beleve not that where on they were set .
60002009	But ye are a chosyn generacion a royall presthod an holy nacio and a peculiar people that ye shuld shewe the vertues of him that called you out of darknes into hys marvelous light
60002010	which in tyme past were not a people yet are now the people of God : which were not vnder mercye but now have obteyned mercye .
60002011	Derly beloved I beseche you as straugers and pilgrems abstayne from flesshly lustes which fyght agaynst the soule
60002012	and se that ye have honest conversacion amonge the getyls that they which backbyte you as evyll doars maye se youre good workes and prayse god in the daye of visitacion .
60002013	Submit youre selves vnto all manner ordinaunce of man for the lordes sake whether it be vnto the kynge as vnto the chefe heed :
60002014	other vnto rulars as vnto them that are sent of him for the punysshment of evyll doars : but for the laude of them that do well .
60002015	For so is the will of god that ye put to sylence the ygnorancie of the folyshe men :
60002016	as fre and not as havinge ye libertie for a cloke of maliciousnes but even as the servautes of god .
60002017	Honoure all men . Love brotherly felishippe . Feare god and honour the kynge .
60002018	Servauntes obey youre masters with all feare not only yf they be good and courteous : but also though they be frowarde .
60002019	For it is thankeworthye yf a man for conscience towarde god endure grefe sufferinge wrongfully .
60002020	For what prayse is it if when ye be buffeted for youre fautes ye take it paciently ? But and yf when ye do well ye suffer wronge and take it paciently then is there thanke with God .
60002021	For herevnto verely were ye called : for Christ also suffered for vs levinge vs an insample yt ye shuld folowe his steppes
60002022	which dyd no sinne nether was ther gyle founde in his mouth :
60002023	which when he was reviled reviled not agayne : whe he suffered he threatened not : but comitted the cause to him that iudgeth ryghteously
60002024	which his awne silfe bare oure synnes in his body on the tree that we shuld be delyvered from synne and shuld lyve in rightewesnes . By whose strypes ye were healed .
60002025	For ye were as shepe goinge astraye : but are now returned vnto ye shepheerd and bisshoppe of youre soules .
60003001	Lykewyse let the wyves be in subieccio to their husbades that eve they which beleve not the worde maye with out the worde be wonne by the conversacion of ye wyves :
60003002	whill they beholde youre pure coversacion coupled with feare .
60003003	Whose apparell shall not be outwarde with broyded heare and hanginge on of golde other in puttinge on of gorgious aparell :
60003004	but let the hyd man of the herte be incorrupt with a meke and a quyet sprete which sprete is before God a thinge moche set by .
60003005	For after this maner in the olde tyme dyd the holy wemen which trusted in God tyer the selves and were obediet to their husbades
60003006	eve as Sara obeyed Abraha and called him Lorde : whose doughters ye are as longe as ye do well and be not afrayde of every shadowe .
60003007	Lyke wyse ye men dwell with them accordinge to knowledge gevinge honoure vnto the wyfe as vnto the weaker vessell and as vnto them that are heyres also of the grace of lyfe that youre prayers be not let .
60003008	In coclusion be ye all of one mynde one suffre with another love as brethren be petifull be courteous
60003009	not redringe evyll for evyll nether rebuke for rebuke : but contrary wyse blesse remembringe yt ye are thervnto called even yt ye shuld be heyres of blessinge .
60003010	If eny ma longe after life and loveth to se good dayes let him refrayne his tonge fro evyll and his lippes that they speake not gyle .
60003011	Let him eschue evyll and do good : let him seke peace and ensue it .
60003012	For ye eyes of ye Lorde are over ye righteous and his eares are open vnto their prayers . But ye face of the Lorde beholdeth the that do evyll .
60003013	Moreover who is it that will harme you yf ye folowe yt which is good ?
60003014	Not withstondynge happy are ye yf ye suffre for rightewesnessis sake . Ye and feare not though they seme terrible vnto you nether be troubled :
60003015	but sanctifie the Lorde God in youre hertes . Be redy all wayes to geve an answere to every man that axeth you a reson of the hope that is in you and that with meaknes and feare :
60003016	havinge a good consciece that when they backbyte you as evyll doars they maye be ashamed for as moche as they have falsely accused youre good conversacion in Christ .
60003017	It is better ( yf the wyll of God be so ) that ye suffre for well doynge then for evyll doynge .
60003018	For as moche as Christ hath once suffered for synnes ye iuste for ye vniuste forto bringe vs to God and was kylled as pertayninge to the flesshe : but was quyckened in the sprete .
60003019	In which sprete he also wet and preached vnto the spretes that were in preson
60003020	which were in tyme passed disobedient when the longe sufferinge of God abode excedinge paciently in the dayes of Noe whyll the arcke was a preparinge wherin feawe ( that is to saye . viii soules ) were saved by water
60003021	which signifieth baptim that now saveth vs not ye puttinge awaye of ye filth of the flesshe but in that a good conscience consenteth to God by ye resurreccio of Iesus Christ
60003022	which is oure right honde of God and is gone into heve angels power and myght subdued vnto him .
60004001	For as moche as christ hath suffred for vs in the flesshe arme youre selves lyke wyse with the same mynde : for he which suffereth in the flesshe ceasith fro synne
60004002	that he hence forwarde shuld lyve as moche tyme as remayneth in the flesshe : not after ye lustes of men but after the will of God .
60004003	For it is sufficient for vs that we have spent the tyme that is past of the lyfe after the will of the gentyls walkinge in wantannes lustes dronkennes in eatinge drinkinge and in abominable ydolatrie .
60004004	And it semeth to them a straunge thinge that ye runne not also with them vnto the same excesse of ryote and therfore speake they evill of you
60004005	which shall geve a coptes to him that is redy to iudge quycke and deed .
60004006	For vnto this purpose verely was ye gospell preached vnto the ( deed ) that they shuld be condempned of men in ye flesshe but shuld live before God in the sprete .
60004007	The ende of all thinges is at honde . Be ye therfore discrete and sober yt ye maye be apte to prayers .
60004008	But above all thinges have fervet love amoge you . For love covereth the multitude of synnes .
60004009	Be ye herberous one to another and that wt out grudginge .
60004010	As every man hath receaved the gyfte minister the same one to another as good ministers of the manyfolde grace of God .
60004011	Yf eny man speake let him talke as though he spake ye wordes of God . If eny man minister let him do it as of ye abilitie which god ministreth vnto him . That god in all thinges maye be glorified thorow Iesus Christ to whom be prayse and dominion for ever and whyll the worlde stondeth . Amen .
60004012	Dearly beloved be not troubled in this heate which now is come amoge you to trye you as though some strauge thinge had happened vnto you :
60004013	but reioyce in as moche as ye are partetakers of Christes passions that when his glory appereth ye maye be mery and glad .
60004014	If ye be rayled vpon for the name of Christ happie are ye . For the sprete of glory and the sprete of god resteth apon you . On their parte he is evyll spoken of : but on youre parte he is glorified .
60004015	Se that none of you suffre as a murtherer or as a thefe or an evyll doar or as a busybody in other mens matters .
60004016	Yf eny man suffre as a Christe man let him not be ashamed : but let him glorifie god on his behalfe .
60004017	For the tyme is come that iudgement must begynne at the housse of god . If it fyrst begynne at vs what shall the ende be of them which beleve not the gospell of god ?
60004018	And yf the righteous scasly be saved : where shall the vngodly and the sinner appere ?
60004019	Wherfore let them that suffer accordynge to the will of god commit their soules to him with well doynge as vnto a faythfull creator
60005001	The elders which are amonge you I exhorte which am also an elder and a witnes of the affliccions of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shalbe opened :
60005002	se that ye fede Christes flocke which is amonge you takynge the oversyght of them not as though ye were compelled therto but willyngly : not for the desyre of filthy lucre but of a good mynde .
60005003	not as though ye were lordes over the parisshes : but that ye be a insample to the flocke .
60005004	And when the chef shepheerde shall appere ye shall receave an incorruptible croune of glorye .
60005005	Lykwyse ye yonger submit youre selves vnto the elder . Submit youre selves every man one to another knet youre selves togedder in lowlines of mynde . For god resisteth ye proude and geveth grace to the humble .
60005006	Submit youre selves therfore vnder the myghty honde of god that he maye exalt you whe the tyme is come .
60005007	Cast all youre care to him : for he careth for you .
60005008	Be sober and watch for youre adversary ye devyll as a rorynge lion walketh about sekynge whom he maye devoure :
60005009	whom resist stedfust in the fayth remebrynge that ye do but fulfill the same affliccios which are apoynted to youre brethren that are in the worlde .
60005010	The God of all grace which called you vnto his eternall glory by Christ Iesus shall his awne silfe after ye have soffred a lytell affliccio make you perfect : shall settle strenght and stablishe you .
60005011	To him be glory and dominio for ever and whill the worlde endureth Amen .
60005012	By Silvanus a faythfull brother vnto you ( as I suppose ) have I written brefly exhortynge and testifyinge how that this is the true grace of god wherin ye stonde .
60005013	The companious of youre eleccion yt are at Babilo saluteth you and Marcus my sonne .
60005014	Grete ye one another with the kysse of love . Peace be with you all which are in Christ Iesus . Amen .
61001001	Simon Peter a seruaunt and an Apostle of Iesus Christ to them which have obtayned lyke precious fayth with vs in the rightewesnes that commeth of oure God and savioure Iesus Christ .
61001002	Grace with you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Iesus oure Lorde .
61001003	Accordinge as his godly power hath geven vnto vs all thinges that pertayne vnto lyfe and godlynes thorow the knowledge of him that hath called vs by vertue and glory
61001004	by the meanes whereof are geven vnto vs excellent and moste greate promises that by the helpe of them ye shuld be partakers of the godly nature in that ye flye the corrupcion of worldy lust .
61001005	And hervnto geve all diligence : in youre fayth minister vertve and in vertue knowledge
61001006	and in knowledge temperancy and in temrancy pacience in pacience godlynes
61001007	in godlynes brotherly kyndnes in brotherly kyndnes love .
61001008	For yf these thinges be amonge you and are plenteous they wyll make you that ye nether shalbe ydle nor vnfrutefull in the knowledge of oure lorde Iesus Christ .
61001009	But he yt lacketh these thynges is blynde and gropeth for ye waye with his honde and hath forgotten yt he was pourged from his olde synnes .
61001010	Wherfore brethren geve the moare diligence forto make youre callynge and eleccion sure . For yf ye do soche thynges ye shall never erre .
61001011	Ye and by this meanes an entrynge in shall be ministred vnto you aboundantly in to the everlastynge kyngdome of oure lorde and saveoure Iesus Christ .
61001012	Wherfore I will not be necgligent to put you allwayes in remembraunce of soche thinges though that ye knowe them youre selves and be also stablisshed in the present trueth .
61001013	Notwithstodinge I thynke yt mete ( as longe as I am in this tabernacle ) to stere you vp by puttynge you in remebraunce
61001014	for as moch as I am sure howe that the tyme is at honde yt I must put of my tabernacle even as oure lorde Iesus Christ hath shewed me .
61001015	I will enfource therfore that on every syde ye myght have wherwith to stere vp the remembraunce of these thynges after my departynge .
61001016	For we folowed not decevable fables whe we openned vnto you the power and commynge of oure lorde Iesus Christ but with oure eyes we sawe his maieste :
61001017	even then verely when he receaved of god the father honour and glory and when ther came soche a voyce to him from excellent glorie . This is my dere beloved sonne in whom I have delite .
61001018	This voyce we hearde when it came from heven beynge with him in the holy mounte .
61001019	We have also a right sure worde of prophesye wher vnto yf ye take hede as vnto a lyght yt shyneth in a darke place ye do wel vntill the daye dawne and the daye starre aryse in youre hertes .
61001020	So that ye fyrst knowe this . that no prophesye in the scripture hath eny private interpretacio .
61001021	For the scripture came never by the will of man : but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy goost .
61002001	Ther were falce prophetes amonge the people even as ther shalbe falce teachers amonge you : wich prevely shall brynge in damnable sectes even denyinge the Lorde that hath bought them and brynge vpon them selves swyft damnacion
61002002	and many shall folowe their damnable wayes by which the waye of trueth shalbe evyll spoken of
61002003	and thorow coveteousnes shall they with fayned wordes make marchandyse of you whose iudgement is not farre of and their dampnacion slepeth not .
61002004	For yf god spared not the angels that synned but cast them doune into hell and delyuered them in chaynes of darknes to be kept vnto iudgement .
61002005	Nether spared the olde worlde but saved Noe the ryghte preacher of rightewesnes and brought in the flud vpon the worlde of the vngodly
61002006	and turned the cities of zodom and Gomor into asshes : overthrewe them damned the and made on them an ensample vnto all yt after shuld live vngodly .
61002007	And iust Lot vexed with the vnclenly conversacio of the wicked delivered he .
61002008	For he beynge ryghteous and dwellynge amonge them in seynge and hearynge vexed his righteous soule from daye to daye with their vnlawfull dedes .
61002009	The lorde knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptacion and how to reserve the vniuste vnto the daye of iudgement for to be punisshed :
61002010	namely them that walke after the flesshe in the lust of vnclennes and despyse the rulars . Presumpteous are they and stubborne and feare not to speake evyll of them that are in auctorite .
61002011	When ye angels which are greater bothe in power and myght receave not of ye lorde raylynge iudgement agaynst them .
61002012	But these as brute beastes naturally made to betaken and destroyed speake evyll of that they knowe not and shall perisshe through their awne destruccion
61002013	and receave the rewarde of vnrightewesnes . They count it pleasure to live deliciously for a season . Spottes they are and filthines livinge at pleasure and in disceaveable wayes feastynge with you :
61002014	havinge eyes full of advoutrie and that canot cease to synne begylynge vnstable soules . Hertes they have exercised wt coveteousnes . They are cursed chyldren
61002015	and have forsaken the right waye and are gone astraye folowinge ye waye of Balam the sonne of Bosor which loved the rewarde of vnrightewesnes :
61002016	but was rebuked of his iniquitie . The tame and dome beast speakinge with manes voyce forbade the folisshnes of the Prophete .
61002017	These are welles without water and cloudes caried about of a tepest to whome the myst of darcknes is reserved for ever .
61002018	For when they have spoke the swellinge wordes of vanytie they begyle wt wantanes thorowe yt lustes of the flesshe them that were clene escaped : but now are wrapped in errours .
61002019	They promys them libertye and are them selves ye bonde servauntes of corrupcion . For of whom soever a man is over come vnto ye same is he in bondage .
61002020	For yf they after they have escaped from the filthynes of the worlde thorowe ye knowledge of ye Lorde and of ye saviour Iesus Christ they are yet tagled agayne therin and overcome : then is ye latter ende worsse with them then the beginninge .
61002021	For it had bene better for the not to have knowne ye waye of righteousnes then after they have knowe it to turne fro the holy comaundmet geve vnto them .
61002022	It is happened vnto them accordinge to the true proverbe : The dogge is turned to his vomet agayne and the sow that was wesshed to her wallowynge in the myre .
61003001	This is the seconde pistle that I now wryte vnto you beloved wherwith I stere vp and warne youre pure myndes to call to remembrauce
61003002	the wordes which were tolde before of the holy prophetes and also the commaundement of vs the apostles of the lorde and saveour .
61003003	This fyrst vnderstode that ther shall come in the last dayes mockers which will walke after their awne lustes
61003004	and saye . Where is the promes of his comynge ? For sence ye fathers dyed all thinges cotinue in ye same estate wher in they were at ye begynninge .
61003005	This they knowe not ( and that willyngly ) how that the hevens a great whyle ago were and the erth that was in the water appered vp out of the water by the worde of god :
61003006	by the which thinges the worlde yt then was perisshed over flowen wt the water .
61003007	But the heves verely and erth which are now are kept by the same worde in store and reserved vnto fyre agaynst the daye of iudgement and perdicion of vngodly men .
61003008	Derely beloved be not ignorant of this one thynge how that one daye is wt the lorde as a thousande yeare and a thousand yeare as one daye .
61003009	The lorde is not slacke to fulfill his promes as some men cout slacknes : but is pacient to vs warde and wolde have no man lost but wolde receave all men to repentauce .
61003010	Neverthelesse ye daye of the lorde will come as a thefe in ye nyght in the which daye ye hevens shall perisshe with terrible noyes and the elemetes shall melt with heet and the erth with the workes that are therin shall burne .
61003011	Yf all these thinges shall perisshe what maner persons ought ye to be in holy conversacion and godlynes :
61003012	lokynge for and hastynge vnto the commynge of the daye of God in which the hevens shall perisshe with fyre and the elementes shalbe consumed with heate .
61003013	Neverthelesse we loke for a newe heven and a newe erth accordynge to his promes where in dwelleth rightewesnes .
61003014	Wherfore derly beloved seynge yt ye loke for soche thynges be diliget that ye maye be founde of him in peace wt out spotte and vndefiled
61003015	And suppose that ye longe sufferynge of the lorde is saluacion even as oure derely beloved brother Paul accordynge to ye wysdome geve vnto him wrote to you
61003016	yee almost in very pistle speakynge of soche thynges : amoge which are many thynges harde to be vnderstonde which they that are vnlearned and vnstable pervert as they do other scriptures vnto their awne destruccio .
61003017	Ye therfore beloved seynge ye knowe it before hande beware lest ye be also plucked a waye with the erroure of the wicked and fall from youre awne stedfastnes :
61003018	but growe in grace and in the knowledge of oure lorde and saveoure Iesus Christ . To whom he glory bothe now and for ever . Amen .
62001001	That which was fro the begynninge concerninge which we have hearde which we have sene with oure eyes which we have loked vpon and oure hondes have hadled of the worde of life .
62001002	For the lyfe appered and we have sene and beare witnes and shewe vnto you that eternall lyfe which was with the father and appered vnto vs .
62001003	That which we have sene and herde declare we vnto you that ye maye have felloushippe with vs and that oure fellishippe maye be with the father and his sonne Iesus Christ .
62001004	And this write we vnto you that oure ioye maye be full .
62001005	And this is the tydynges which we have hearde of him and declare vnto you that god is lyght and in him is no darknes at all
62001006	yf we saye that we have fellishippe with him and yet walke in darknes we lye and do not the truth :
62001007	but and yf we walke in ( lyght ) even as he is in lyght then have we fellishippe with him and the bloud of Iesus Christ his sonne clenseth vs from all synne .
62001008	Yf we saye that we have no synne we deceave oure selves and trueth is not in vs .
62001009	Yf we knowledge oure synnes he is faythfull and iust to forgeve vs oure synnes and to clense vs from all vnrightewesnes .
62001010	Yf we saye we have not sinned we make him a lyar and his worde is not in vs .
62002001	My lytell children these thynges write I vnto you that ye synne not : yf eny man synne yet we have an advocate with ye father Iesus Christ which is righteous :
62002002	and he it is that obteyneth grace for oure synnes : not for oure synnes only : but also for the synnes of all the worlde .
62002003	And herby we are sure that we knowe him yf we kepe his comaundementes .
62002004	He that sayth I knowe him and kepeth not his commaundementes is a lyar and the veritie is not in him .
62002005	Whosoever kepeth his ( worde ) in him is the love of god parfect in dede . And therby knowe we that we are in him .
62002006	He that sayth he bydeth in him ought to walke even as he walked .
62002007	Brethren I write no newe comaundement vnto you : but that olde comaundemet which ye hearde from the begynnynge .
62002008	The olde comaundement is the worde which ye hearde from the begynnynge . Agayne a newe comaundement I write vnto you a thynge that is true in him and also in you : for the darknes is past and the true lyght now shyneth .
62002009	He that sayth how that he is in the light and yet hateth his brother is in darknes even vntyll this tyme .
62002010	He that loveth his brother abydeth in the light and ther is none occasion of evyll in him .
62002011	He that hateth his brother is in darknes and walketh in darknes : and cannot tell whither he goeth because that darknes hath blynded his eyes .
62002012	Babes I write vnto you how that youre synnes are forgeven you for his names sake .
62002013	I wryte vnto you fathers how that ye have knowen him that was from the begynnynge . I wryte vnto you yonge men how that ye have overcome the wicked . I wryte vnto you lytell children how that ye have knowne the father .
62002014	I wryte vnto you fathers how that ye have knowe him that was fro the begynnynge . I wryte vnto you youge men how that ye are stronge : and the worde of God abydeth in you and ye have overcome that wicked .
62002015	Se that ye love not the worlde nether the thynges that are in the worlde . Yf eny man love the worlde the love of the father is not in him .
62002016	For all that is in ye worlde ( as the lust of the flesshe the lust of the eyes and ye pryde of gooddes ) is not of the father : but of ye worlde
62002017	And the worlde vannyssheth awaye and the lust therof : but he that fulfilleth the will of god abydeth ever .
62002018	Lytell children it is the last tyme and as ye have herde how that Antichrist shall come : even now are there many Antichristes come allredy . Wherby we knowe that it is the last tyme .
62002019	They went oute from vs but they were not of vs . For yf they had bene of vs they wolde no dout have continued with vs . But that fortuned that yt myght appere that they were not of vs .
62002020	And ye have an oyntment of ye holy gost and ye knowe all thynges .
62002021	I wrote not vnto you as though ye knewe not the trueth : but as though ye knewe it and knowe also that no lye commeth of trueth .
62002022	Who is a lyar : but he that denyeth that Iesus is Christ ? The same is the Antichrist that denyeth the father and the sonne .
62002023	Whosoever denyeth the sonne the same hath not the father .
62002024	Let therfore abyde in you that same which ye hearde from the begynnynge . Yf that which ye hearde from ye begynnynge shall remayne in you ye also shall continewe in the sonne and in the father
62002025	And this is the promes yt he hath promysed vs even eternall lyfe .
62002026	This have I writte vnto you concernynge the yt disceave you .
62002027	And ye anoyntynge which ye have receaved of him dwelleth in you . And ye nede not that eny man teache you : but as ye annoyntynge teaheth you all thynges and is true and is no lye : and as it taught you even so byde therin .
62002028	And nowe babes abyde in him that when he shall appere we maye be bolde and not be made a shamed of him at his commynge .
62002029	Yf ye knowe that he is righteous knowe also that he which foloweth rightewesnes is borne of him .
62003001	Beholde what love the father hath shewed on vs that we shuld be called the sonnes of god . For this cause the worlde knoweth you not because it knoweth not him .
62003002	Derely beloved now are we ye sonnes of God and yet it dothe not appere what we shal be . But we knowe that when it shall appere we shal be lyke him . For we shall se him as he is .
62003003	And every man that hath thys hope in him pourgeth him silfe even as he ys pure .
62003004	Whosover committeth synne committeth vnrighteousnes also for synne is vnrighteousnes .
62003005	And ye knowe that he appered to take awaye oure synnes and in him is no synne .
62003006	As many as byde in him synne not : whosoever synneth hath not sene him nether hath knowen him .
62003007	Babes let no man deceave you He that doeth righteousnes is righteous even as he is righteous .
62003008	He that comitteth synne is of the devill : for the devyll synneth sence the begynnynge . For this purpose appered the sonne of god to lowse the workes of the devill .
62003009	Whosoever is borne of god sinneth not : for his seed remayneth in him and he cannot sinne because he is borne of god .
62003010	In this are the children of god knowen and the children of the devyll . Whosoever doeth not rightewesnes is not of God nether he that loveth not his brother .
62003011	For this is the tydinges that ye hearde fro the begynninge that we shuld love one another :
62003012	not as Cayn which was of the wicked and slewe his brother . And wherfore slewe he him ? Because his awne workes were evyll and his brothers good .
62003013	Marvayle not my brethren though the worlde hate you .
62003014	We knowe that we are translated from deeth vnto lyfe be cause we love the brethren . He that loveth not his brother abydeth in deeth .
62003015	Whosoever hateth his brother is a man slear . And ye knowe that no man slear hath eternall lyfe abydinge in him .
62003016	Herby perceave we love : that he gave his lyfe for vs : and therfore ought we also to geve oure lyves for the brethre .
62003017	Whosoever hath this worldes good and seith his brother have neade : and shutteth vp his copassion from him : how dwelleth the love of God in him ?
62003018	My babes let vs not love in worde nether in tonge : but with dede and in veritie :
62003019	for therby we knowe that we are of the veritie and can before him quiet oure hertes .
62003020	But yf oure hertes condempne vs God is gretter then oure hertes and knoweth all thinges .
62003021	Beloved yf oure hertes condempne vs not then have we trust to god warde :
62003022	and what soever we axe we shall receave of him : be cause we kepe his commaundementes and do those thinges which are pleasinge in his sight .
62003023	And this is his comaundemet that we beleve on ye name of his sonne Iesus Christ and love one another as he gave comaundemet .
62003024	And he yt kepeth his comaundemetes dwelleth in him and he in him : and therby we knowe that ther abydeth in vs of the sprete which he gave vs .
62004001	Ye beloved beleve not every sprete : but prove the spretes whether they are of God or no : for many falce Prophetes are gone out into the worlde .
62004002	Herby shall ye knowe the sprete of God . Every sprete that confesseth that Iesus Christ is come in the flesshe is of God .
62004003	And every sprete which cofesseth not yt Iesus Christ is come in the flesshe is not of God . And this is that sprete of Antichrist of whom ye have hearde howe that he shuld come : and even now alredy is he in the worlde .
62004004	Lytell chyldre ye are of God and have overcome them : for greater is he yt is in you then he that is in the worlde .
62004005	They are of the worlde and therfore speake they of the worlde and the worlde heareth them .
62004006	We are of God . He yt knoweth God heareth vs : he that is not of God heareth vs not . Herby knowe we ye sprete of veritie and the sprete of erroure .
62004007	Beloved let vs love one another : for love cometh of God . And every one that loveth is borne of God and knoweth God .
62004008	He that loveth not knoweth not God : for God is love .
62004009	In this appered ye love of god to vs ward because that god sent his only begotten sonne into the worlde that we myght live thorow him .
62004010	Herin is love not that we loved god but that he loved vs and sent his sonne to make agrement for oure sinnes .
62004011	Beloved yf god so loved vs we ought also to love one another .
62004012	No man hath sene god at enytyme . Yf we love one another god dwelleth in vs and his love is parfect in vs .
62004013	Herby know we that we dwell in him and he in vs : because he hath geven vs of his sprete .
62004014	And we have sene and do testifie that the father sent the sonne which is the saveour of the worlde .
62004015	Whosoever confesseth that Iesus is the sonne of god in him dwelleth god and he in god .
62004016	And we have knowen and beleved the love that god hath to vs . God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him .
62004017	Herin is the love perfect in vs that we shuld have trust in the daye of iudgement : For as he is even so are we in this worlde .
62004018	Ther is no feare in love but parfect love casteth out all feare for feare hath paynfulnes . He yt feareth is not parfect in love .
62004019	We love him for he loved vs fyrst .
62004020	Yf a man saye I love god and yet hate his brother he is a lyar . For how can he yt loveth not his brother whom he hath sene love god whom he hath not sene ?
62004021	And this commaundemet have we of him : that he which loveth God shuld love his brother also .
62005001	Whosoever beleveh that Iesus is Christ is borne of god . And every one yt loveth him which begat loveth him also which was begotte of him .
62005002	In this we knowe yt we love the children of god whe we love god and kepe his comaudementes .
62005003	This is ye love of god yt we kepe his comaundemetes and his comaundementes are not greveous
62005004	For all that is borne of god over commeth the worlde . And this is the victory that overcometh the worlde even oure fayth .
62005005	Who is it that overcommeth the worlde : but he which beleveth that Iesus is ye sonne of god ?
62005006	This Iesus Christ is he that ca by water and bloud not by water only : but by water and bloud . And it is the sprete that beareth witnes because the sprete ys trueth .
62005007	( For ther are thre which beare recorde in heuen the father the worde and the wholy goost . And these thre are one )
62005008	For there are thre which beare recorde ( in erth : ) the sprete and water and bloud : and these thre are one .
62005009	Yf we receave the witnes of men the witnes of god is greater . For this is the witnes of god which he testifyed of his sonne .
62005010	He that beleveth on the sonne of god hath the witnes in him silfe . He that beleveth not God hath made him a lyar be cause he beleved not the recorde that god gave of his sonne .
62005011	And this ys that recorde how that god hath geven vnto vs eternall lyfe and this lyfe is in his sonne .
62005012	He that hath the sonne hath lyfe : and he that hath not the sonne of god hath not lyfe .
62005013	These thynges have I written vnto you that beleve on the name of the sonne of God that ye maye knowe howe that ye have eternall lyfe and that ye maye beleve on the name of the sonne of god .
62005014	And this is the trust that we have in him : that yf we axe eny thinge accordynge to his will he heareth vs .
62005015	And yf we knowe that he heare vs what soever we axe we knowe that we shall have the peticions that we desyre of him .
62005016	Yf eny man se his brother synne a synne that is not vnto deeth let him axe and he shall geve him lyfe for them that synne not vnto deeth . Ther is a synne vnto deeth for which saye I not that a man shuld praye .
62005017	All vnrightewesnes is synne and ther is synne not vnto deeth .
62005018	We knowe that whosoever is borne of god synneth not : but he that is begotten of god kepeth him silfe and that wicked toucheth him not .
62005019	We knowe that we are of god and that the worlde is altogedder set on wickednes .
62005020	We knowe that the sonne of God is come and hath geven vs a mynde to knowe him which is true : and we are in him that is true through his sonne Iesu Christ . This same is very god and eternall lyfe .
62005021	Babes kepe youre selves from ymages . Amen .
63001001	The elder to the electe lady and her chyldren which I love in the trueth : and not I only but also all that have knowe the trueth
63001002	for the truthes sake which dwelleth in vs and shalbe in vs for ever .
63001003	With you be grace mercy and peace from God ye father and from the Lorde Iesus Christ the sonne of the father in trueth and love .
63001004	I reioysed greatly that I founde of thy chyldre walkinge in trouth as we have receaved a commaundement of the father .
63001005	And nowe beseche I the lady not as though I wrote a newe commaundement vnto the but that same which we had fro the begynninge that we shuld love one another .
63001006	And this is the love that we shulde walke after his commaundementes . This commaundement is ( that as ye have hearde from the begynninge ) ye shuld walke in it .
63001007	For many deceavers are entred in to the worlde which confesse not that Iesus Christ is come in the flesshe . This is a deceaver and an Antichrist .
63001008	Loke on youre selves that we loose not that we have wrought : but that we maye have a full rewarde .
63001009	Whosoever transgresseth and bydeth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God . He yt endureth in the doctrine of Christ hath bothe the father and the sonne .
63001010	Yf ther come eny vnto you and bringe not this learninge him receave not to housse : nether bid him God spede .
63001011	For he that biddeth him God spede is parttaker of his evyll dedes .
63001012	I had many thinges to wryte vnto you neverthelesse I wolde not wryte with paper and ynke : but I trust to come vnto you and speake with you mouth to mouth that oure ioye maye be full .
63001013	The sonnes of thy electe syster grete the . Amen .
64001001	The Elder vnto the beloven Gayus whom I love in ye trueth .
64001002	Beloved I wisshe in all thinges that thou prosperedest and faredest well eve as thy soule prospereth .
64001003	I reioysed greatly when the brethren came and testified of the trueth that is in the how thou walkest in trouthe .
64001004	I have no greater ioye then for to heare howe that my sonnes walke in veritie .
64001005	Beloved thou doest faythfully what soever thou doest to the brethren and to straungers
64001006	which bare witnes of thy love before all the congregacion . Which brethren whe thou bryngest forwardes on their iorney ( as it besemeth god ) thou shalt do well :
64001007	because that for his names sake they went forth and toke nothinge of the gentyls .
64001008	We therfore ought to receave soche that we also myght be helpers to the trueth .
64001009	I wrote vnto the congregacio : but Diotrephes which loveth to have the preeminence amoge them receaveth vs not .
64001010	Wherfore yf I come I will declare his dedes which he doeth iestinge on vs with malicious wordes nether is therewith content . Not only he him silfe receaveth not the brethre : but also he forbiddeth them that wolde and thrusteth them out of the congregacion .
64001011	Beloved folowe not that which is evyll but that which is good . He that doeth well is of God : but he yt doeth evyll seith not God .
64001012	Demetrius hath good reporte of all men and of the trueth : ye and we oure selves also beare recorde and ye knowe that oure recorde is true .
64001013	I have many thinges to wryte : but I will not with ynke and penne wryte vnto the .
64001014	For I trust I shall shortly se the and we shall speake mouth to mouth . Peace be with the . The lovers salute the . Grete the lovers by name .
64001015	
65001001	Iudas the servaunt of Iesus Christ the brother of Iames . To them which are cal and sanctified in god the father and preserved in Iesu Christ .
65001002	Mercy vnto you and peace and love be multiplied .
65001003	Beloved when I gave all diligence to write vnto you of the commen saluacion : it was nedfull for me to wryte vnto you to exhorte you that ye shuld continually laboure in the fayth which was once geve vnto the sayntes
65001004	For ther are certayne craftely crept in of which it was write afore tyme vnto soche iudgemet . They are vngodly and turne the grace of oure God vnto wantannes and denye God the only Lorde and oure Lorde Iesus Christ .
65001005	My mynde is therfore to put you in remebraunce for as moche as ye once knowe this how that the Lorde ( after that he had delivered the people out of Egypt ) destroyed them which afterwarde beleved not .
65001006	The angels also which kept not their fyrst estate : but lefte their awne habitacion he hath reserved in everlastinge chaynes vnder darcknes vnto ye iudgemet of the greate daye :
65001007	eve as Sodom and Gomor and the cities aboute them ( which in lyke maner defiled them selves with fornicacio and folowed straunge flesshe ) are set forth for an ensample and suffre the vengeaunce of eternall fyre .
65001008	Lykwyse these dremers defyle the flesshe despyse rulars and speake evyll of them that are in auctoritie .
65001009	Yet Michael the archangell when he strove agaynst the devyll and disputed about the body of Moses durst not geve raylinge sentece but sayde : the Lorde rebuke ye .
65001010	But these speake evyll of those thinges which they knowe not : and what thinges they knowe naturally as beastes which are without reason in tho thinges they corrupte them selves .
65001011	Wo be vnto them for they have folowed ye waye of Cayn and are vtterly geven to the erroure of Balam for lukers sake and perysshe in the treason of Core .
65001012	These are spottes which of youre kindnes feast to gedder with out feare fedynge them selves . Cloudes they are with outen water caried about of wyndes and trees with out frute at gadringe tyme twyse deed and plucked vp by the rotes .
65001013	They are the ragynge waves of ye see fominge out their awne shame . They are wandrynge starres to whom is reserved the myst of darcknes for ever .
65001014	Enoch the seventh from Adam prophesied before of suche saying : Beholde ye lorde shall come with thousandes of sayntes
65001015	to geve iudgement agaynst all men and to rebuke all that are vngodly amonge them of all their vngodly dedes which they have vngodly comitted and of all their cruell speakynges which vngodly sinners have spoken agaynst him .
65001016	These are murmurers complayners walkynge after their awne lustes whose mouthes speake proude thynges . They have men in greate reverence be cause of a vauntage .
65001017	But ye beloved remember the wordes which were spoken before of the Apostles of oure lorde Iesus Christ
65001018	how that they tolde you that ther shulde be begylers in the last tyme which shuld walke after ther awne vngodly lustes .
65001019	These are makers of sectes fleshlie havynge no sprete .
65001020	But ye derlye beloved edyfie yovre selves in youre most holy fayth prayinge in the holy goost
65001021	and kepe youre selves in the love of God lokinge for ye mercy of oure lorde Iesus Christ vnto eternall lyfe .
65001022	And have compassion on some separatynge them :
65001023	and other save with feare pullinge them out of the fyre and hate the fylthy vesture of the flesshe .
65001024	Vnto him that is able to kepe you that ye faule not and to present you fautlesse before the presence of his glory with ioye
65001025	yt is to saye to God oure saveour which only is wyse be glory maiestie dominion and power now and for ever . Amen .
66001001	The reuelacion of Iesus Christe which god gave vnto him for to shewe vnto his servauntes thinges which muste shortly come to passe . And he sent and shewed by his angell vnto his servaunt Ihon
66001002	which bare recorde of the worde of god and of the testimony of Iesus Christe and of all thinges yt he sawe .
66001003	Happy is he that redith and they that heare the wordes of the prophesy and kepe thoo thinges which are written therin . For the tyme is at honde .
66001004	Ihon to the . vii . congregacios in Asia . Grace be with you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the . vii . spretes which are present before his trone
66001005	and from Iesus Christ which is a faythfull witnes and fyrst begotte of the deed : and Lorde over the kinges of the erth . Vnto him that loved vs and wesshed vs fro synnes in his awne bloud
66001006	and made vs kinges and Prestes vnto God his father be glory and dominion for ever more . Amen .
66001007	Beholde he commeth with cloudes and all eyes shall se him : and they also which peersed him . And all kinredes of ye erth shall wayle . Even so . Amen .
66001008	I am Alpha and Omega the begynninge and the endinge sayth the Lorde almyghty which is and which was and which is to come .
66001009	I Ihon youre brother and companyon in tribulacion and in the kyngdom and pacience which is in Iesu Christe was in the yle of Pathmos for the worde of god and for ye witnessynge of Iesu Christe .
66001010	I was in the sprete on a sondaye and herde behynde me a gret voyce as it had bene of a trompe
66001011	sayinge : I am Alpha and Omega the fyrst and the laste . That thou seist write in a boke and sende it vnto the congregacions which are in Asia vnto Ephesus and vnto Smyrna and vnto Pargamos and vnto Thiatira and vnto Sardis and vnto Philadelphia and vnto Laodicia .
66001012	And I turned backe to se the voyce that spake to me . And when I was turned : I sawe . vii golde candelstyckes
66001013	and in the myddes of the cadelstyckes one lyke vnto ye sone of ma clothed with a lynnen garmet doune to the ground and gyrd aboute the pappes with a golden gyrdle
66001014	His heed and his heares were whyte as whyte woll and as snowe : and his eyes were as a flame of fyre :
66001015	and his fete lyke vnto brasse as though they brent in a fornace : and his voyce as the sounde of many waters .
66001016	And he had in his right honde vii . starres . And out of his mouth wet a sharpe twoo edged swearde . And his face shone eve as the sonne in his strength .
66001017	And when I sawe him I fell at his fete even as deed . And he layde hys ryght honde apon me sayinge vnto me : feare not . I am the fyrst and the laste
66001018	and am alyve and was deed . And beholde I am alyve for ever more and have the kayes of hell and of deeth .
66001019	wryte therfore the thynges which thou haste sene and the thynges which are and the thynges which shalbe fulfylled hereafter :
66001020	and ye mystery of the vii . starres which thou sawest in my ryght honde and the vii . golden candelstyckes . The vii . stares are the messengers of the vii . congregacios : And the vii . candlestyckes which thou sawest are the vii . congregacions .
66002001	Unto the messenger of the congregacion of Ephesus wryte : These thynges sayth he that holdeth the vii . starres in his right honde and walketh in the myddes of the vii . golden candlestyckes
66002002	I knowe thy workes and thy labour and thy pacience and howe thou cannest not forbeare the which are evyll : and examinedst them which saye they are Apostles and are not : and hast founde them lyars
66002003	and dydest wasshe thy self . And hast pacience : and for my names sake hast labored and hast not faynted .

66002006	But this thou haste because thou hatest ye dedes of the Nicolaitans which dedes I also hate .
66002007	Lett him yt hath eares heare what ye sprete sayth vnto the congregacions . To him that overcometh will I geve to eate of the tree of lyfe which is in the myddes of ye paradice of god .
66002008	And vnto the angell of the congregacion of Smyrna wryte : These thynges sayth he that is fyrst and the laste which was deed and is alive .
66002009	I knowe thy workes and tribulacion and poverte but thou art ryche : And I knowe the blaspemy of them whiche call them selves Iewes and are not : but are the congregacio of sathan .
66002010	Feare none of thoo thynges which thou shalt soffre . Beholde the devyll shall caste of you into preson to tempte you and ye shall have tribulacion . x . dayes . Be faythfull vnto the deeth and I will geve the a croune of lyfe .
66002011	Let him that hath ears heare what the sprete sayth to the congregacions : He that overcometh shall not be hurte of the seconde deeth .
66002012	And to the messenger of the congregacion in Pergamos wryte : This sayth he which hath ye sharpe swearde with two edges .
66002013	I knowe thy workes and where thow dwellest evyn where Sathans seat ys and thou kepest my name and hast not denyed my fayth . And in my dayes Antipas was a faythfull witnes of myne which was slayne amonge you where sathan dwelleth .

66003022	Lett him yt hath eares heare what the sprete sayth vnto the congregacions .
66004001	After this I loked and beholde a dore was open in heven and the fyrste voyce which I harde was as it were of a trompet talkinge with me which said : come vp hydder and I will shewe the thynges which must be fulfyllyd hereafter
66004002	And immediatly I was in the sprete : and beholde a seate was put in heven and one sate on the seate .
66004003	And he that sat was to loke apo like vnto a iaspar stone and a sardyne stone : And there was a rayne bowe aboute the seate in syght lyke to an Emeralde .
66004004	And aboute the seate were . xxiiii . seates . And upon the seates . xxiiii . elders syttinge clothed in whyte rayment and had on their heddes crounes of gold .
66004005	And out of the seate proceded lightnynges and thundrynges and voyces and there wer vii . lampes of fyre burninge before ye seate which are the vii . sprettes of God .
66004006	And before the seate there was a see of glasse lyke vnto cristall and in the myddes of the seate and rounde aboute the seate were iiii . bestes full of eyes before and behynde .
66004007	And the fyrste best was lyke a lion the seconde best lyke a calfe and ye thyrde beste had a face as a man and the fourthe beste was like a flyinge egle .
66004008	And the iiii . bestes had eche one of them vi . wynges aboute him and they were full of eyes with in . And they had noo reste daye nether nyght sayinge : holy holy holy lorde god almyghty which was and is and is to come .
66004009	And when those beestes gave glory and honour and thankes to him that sat on the seate which lyveth for ever and ever :
66004010	the xxiiii . elders fell doune before him that sat on the trone and worshipped him that lyveth for ever and caste their crounes before the trone sayinge :
66004011	thou arte worthy lorde to receave glory and honoure and power for thou haste created all thinges and for thy wylles sake they are and were created .
66005001	And I sawe in the right honde of him that sat in ye trone a boke written with in and on the backside sealyd with vii . seales .
66005002	And I sawe a stronge angell which cryed with a loude voyce : Who is worthy to open the boke and to loose the seales therof .
66005003	And no man in heven ner in erth nether vnder the erth was able to open the boke nether to loke thereon .
66005004	And I wepte moche because no man was founde worthy to open and to rede the boke nether to loke thereon .
66005005	And one of the elders sayde unto me : wepe not : Beholde a lion beinge of the tribe of Iuda the rote of Dauid hath obtayned to open the boke and to lose the vii . seales therof .
66005006	And I behelde and loo in the myddes of the seate and of the . iiii . bestes and in the myddes of the elders stode a lambe as though he had bene kylled which had vii . hornes and vii . eyes which are the spretes of God sent into all the worlde .
66005007	And he cam and toke the boke oute of the right honde of him that sate apon the seate .
66005008	And when he had take the boke the . iiii . bestes and xxiiii . elders fell doune before the labe havynge harpes and golden vialles full of odoures which are the prayers of saynctes
66005009	and they songe a newe songe saynge : thou art worthy to take ye boke and to ope ye seales therof : for thou waste kylled and haste redemed vs by thy bloud out of all kynreddes and tonges and people and nacions
66005010	and haste made vs vnto oure god kynges and prestes and we shall raygne on the erth .
66005011	And I behelde and I herd the voyce of many angylles aboute the trone and about the bestes and the elders and I herde thousand thousandes
66005012	saynge wt a lowde voyce : Worthy is the lambe that was killed to receave power and riches and wisdom and strenghte and honoure and glory and blyssynge .
66005013	And all creatures which are in heven and on the erth and vnder the erth and in the see and all that are in them herd I sayinge : blyssinge honour glory and power be vnto hym that sytteth apon the seate and vnto the lambe for ever more .
66005014	And the . iiii . bestes sayd : Ame . And the . xxiiii . elders fell apon their faces and worshypped him that lyveth for ever more .
66006001	And I sawe when the lambe openyd one of the seales and I herde one of the iiii . bestes saye as it were the noyse of thonder come and se .
66006002	And I sawe and beholde there was a whyte horsse and he that sat on him had a bowe and a croune was gevyn vnto him and he went forth conqueringe and forto overcome .
66006003	And when he opened the secode seale I herde the seconde beste saye : come and se .
66006004	And there went out another horsse that was red and power was geven to him that satte thereon to take peace from the erth and that they shulde kyll one another . And there was geven vnto him a gret swearde .
66006005	And when he opened ye thyrde seale I herde the thyrde beste saye : come and se . And I behelde and loo a blacke hors : and he that sate on him had a payre of balances in his honde .
66006006	And I herd a voyce in the myddes of the . iiii . bestes saye : a measure of whete for a peny and iii . measures of barly for a peny : and oyle and wyne se thou hurte not .
66006007	And when he opened the fourthe seale I herde the voyce of the fourthe beste saye : come and se .
66006008	And I loked and beholde a grene horsse and his name that sat on him was deeth and hell folowed after him and power was geven vnto them over the fourthe parte of the erth to kyll with swearde and with honger and with deeth that cometh of vermen of the erth .
66006009	And when he opened the fyfte seale I sawe vnder the aultre the soules of them that were kylled for the worde of God and for the testymony which they had
66006010	and they cryed with a lowde voyce sayinge : How loge tariest thou lorde holy and true to iudge and to avenge oure bloud on them that dwell on the erth ?
66006011	And longe whyte garmentes were geven vnto every one of them . And it was sayde vnto them that they shulde reste for a lyttle season vntyll the nomber of their felowes and brethre and of them that shulde be kylled as they were were fulfylled .
66006012	And I behelde when he opened the sixte seale and loo there was a grett erth quake and the sunne was as blacke as sacke clothe made of heare . And the mone wexed even as bloud :
66006013	and the starres of heven fell vnto the erth even as a fygge tree castith from her her fygges when she is shaken of a myghty wynde .
66006014	And heven vanysshed awaye as a scroll whe it is rolled togedder . And all mountayns and yles were moved oute of their places .
66006015	And the kynges of the erth and the gret men and the ryche men and the chefe captaynes and the myghty men and every bond man and every free man hyd them selves in dennes and in rockes of the hylles
66006016	and sayde to the hylles and rockes : fall on vs and hyde vs from the presence of him that sytteth on the seate and from the wrath of the lambe
66006017	for the grete daye of hys wrath ys come And who can endure it .
66007001	And after that I sawe . iiii . angels stonde on the iiii . corners of ye erth holdynge ye iiii . wyndes of the erth that ye wyndes shulde not blowe on the erthe nether on the see nether on eny tree .
66007002	And I sawe another angell ascende from the rysynge of the sunne : which had the seale of the lyvynge god and he cryed with a loude voyce to the iiii angelles ( to whom power was geven to hurt the erth and the see )
66007003	saying : Hurt not the erth nether the see nether the trees tyll we have sealed ye servauntes of oure god in their forheddes .
66007004	And I herde the nombre of them which were sealed and there were sealed an C . and xliiii . M . of all the trybes of the chyldren of Israhell .

66007009	After this I behelde and lo a gret multitude ( which noma coulde nombre ) of all nacios and people and tonges stode before the seate and before the lambe clothed with longe whyte garmentes and palmes in there hondes
66007010	and cryed with a lowde voyce sayinge : salvacion be asscribed to him that syttith apon the seate of oure god and vnto the lambe .
66007011	And all the angelles stode in the compase of the seate and of the elders and of the iiii . bestes and fel before the seat on their faces and worshipped god
66007012	sayinge amen : Blessynge and glory wisdome and thankes and honour and power and myght be vnto oure god for evermore Amen .
66007013	And one of the elders answered sayinge vnto me : what are these which are arayed in longe whyte garmentes and whence cam they ?
66007014	And I sayde vnto him : lorde thou wottest . And he sayde vnto me : these are they which cam oute of gret tribulacion and made their garmetes large and made them whyte in the bloud of the lambe :
66007015	therfore are they in the presence of the seate of God and serve him daye and nyght in hys temple and he that sytteth in the seate wyll dwell amonge them .
66007016	They shalt honger no more nether thyrst nether shall the sunne lyght on them nether eny heate :
66007017	For the lambe which ys in the myddes of the seate shall fede them and shall ledde them vnto fountaynes of lyuynge water and god shall wype awaye all teares from their eyes .
66008001	And when he had opened the seventh seale there was silence in heven aboute the space of halfe an houre .
66008002	And I sawe angelles stondynge before god and to them were geven vii . trompettes .
66008003	And another angell cam and stode before the aultre havynge a golden senser and moche of odoures was geven vnto him that he shulde offre of the prayers of all saynctes apon the golden aultre which was before ye seate .
66008004	And ye smoke of the odoures which came of ye prayers of all saynctes ascended vppe before god out of ye angelles honde .
66008005	And ye angell toke the senser and fylled it with fyre of the aultre and caste it into the erth and voyces were made and thondrynges and lightnynges and erthquake .
66008006	And the . vii . angells which had the . vii . tropettes prepared them selves to blowe .
66008007	The fyrst angell blewe and there was made hayle and fyre which were myngled with bloud and they were caste into ye erth : and the thryd parte of trees was burnt and all grene grasse was brent .
66008008	And ye seconde angell blewe : and as it were a gret mountayne : burnynge wt fyre was caste in to the see and the thyrde parte of the see tourned to bloud
66008009	and the thyrde parte of the creatures which had lyfe dyed and the thyrde part of shippes were destroyed .
66008010	And the thyrde angell blewe and ther fell a grett starre from heven burnynge as it were a lampe and it fell into the thyrde parte of the ryvers and into fountaynes of waters
66008011	and the name of the starre is called wormwod . And ye thyrde part was turned to wormwod . And many me dyed of the waters because they were made bytter .
66008012	And the fourth angell blew and the thyrde parte of the sunne was smytten and the thyrde parte of the mone and ye thyrde part of starres : so that the thyrde parte of them was darckned . And the daye was smytten that the thyrde part of it shulde not shyne and lyke wyse ye nyght .
66008013	And I behelde and herd an angell flyinge thorowe the myddes of heven sayinge with a lowde voyce : Woo wo to the inhabiters of the erth because of the voyces to come of the trompe of the . iii . angells which were yet to blowe .
66009001	And the fyfte angell blewe and I sawe a stare fall from heven vnto the erth . And to him was geven the kaye of the bottomlesse pytt .
66009002	And he opened the botomlesse pytt and there arose the smoke of a grett fornace . And the sunne and the ayer were darkned by the reason of the smoke of the pytt .
66009003	And there cam out of the smoke locustes vpo the erth : and vnto them was geve power as the scorpions of the erth have power .
66009004	And it hurt ye grasse of the erth : nether eny grene thinge : nether eny tree : but only those me which have not ye seale in their forhedes
66009005	and to the was comaunded yt they shulde not kyll the but yt they shulde be vexed v monethes and their payne was as the payne yt cometh of a scorpion whe he hath stoge a ma .
66009006	And in those dayes shall men seke deeth and shall not fynde it and shall desyre to dye and deeth shall flye fro the .
66009007	And the similitude of the locustes was lyke vnto horses prepared vnto battayll and on their heddes were as it were crownes lyke vnto golde : and their faces were as it had bene the faces of men .
66009008	And they had heare as the heare of wemen . And their tethe were as the tethe of lyons .
66009009	And they had habbergions as it were habbergions of yron . And the sounde of their wynges was as the sounde of charettes when many horsses runne to gedder to battayle .
66009010	And they had tayles lyke vnto scorpions and there were stinges in their tayles . And their power was to hurt men v . monethes .
66009011	And they had a kynge over them which is the angell of the bottomlesse pytt whose name in the hebrew tonge is Abadon : but in the greke tonge Apollion .
66009012	One woo is past and beholde two wooes come after this .
66009013	And the sixte . angell blewe and I herd a voyce from the iiii . corners of the golden aultre which is before god
66009014	saying to the sixte angell which had the trompe : Loose the iiii . angelles which are bounde in the grett ryver Eufrates .
66009015	And the iiii . angelles were loosed which wer prepared for an houre for a daye for a moneth and for a yeare for to slee the thyrde part of me .
66009016	And the nombre of horsme of warre were twenty tymes xM . And I herde the nobre of them .
66009017	And thus I sawe the horses in a vision and them yt sate on the havynge fyry habbergions of a Iacyncte coloure and brymstony and the heeddes of ye horses werre as the heeddes of lyons . And out of their mouthes went forth fyre and smoke and brymstone .
66009018	And of these iii . was the thyrde parte of men kylled : that is to saye of fyre smoke and brymstone which proceded out of the mouthes of them :
66009019	For their power was in their mouthes and in their tayles : for their tayles were lyke vnto serpetes and had heedes and with them they dyd hurt :
66009020	And the remnaunt of the me which were not kylled by these plages repented not of the dedes of their hondes that they shulde not worshyppe devyls and ymages of golde and sylver and brasse and stone and of wood which nether can se nether heare nether goo .
66009021	Also they repented not of their murther and of their sorcery nether of their fornacion nether of their thefte .
66010001	And I sawe another myghtye angell come doune from heven clothed with a cloude and the rayne bowe apon his heed . And hys face as it were the sunne and his fete as yt were pyllars of fyre
66010002	and he had in his honde a lytell boke opyn : and he put his ryght fote apon the see and his lyfte fote on the erth .
66010003	And cryed with a lowde voyce as when a lyon roreth . And when he had cryed seven thondres spake their voyces .
66010004	And whe the vii . thondres had spoken their voyces I was aboute to wryte . And I herde a voyce from heven sayinge vnto me seale vp thoo thynges which the vii . thondres spake and write them not .
66010005	And the angell which I sawe stonde apon the see and apon the erth lyfte vppe his honde to heven
66010006	and swore by him that liveth for ever more which created heven and the thynges that ther in are and the see and the thynges which therin are : that there shulde be no lenger tyme :
66010007	but in the dayes of the voyce of the seventh angell when he shall begyn to blowe : eve the mistery of god shalbe fynisshed as he preached by his servauntes ye prophetes .
66010008	And the voyce which I herde from heven spake vnto me agayne and sayde : goo and take the lytle boke which ys open in the honde of the angell which stondeth apon the see and apon the erth .
66010009	And I went vnto the angell and sayde to him : geve me the lytle boke and he sayd vnto me : take it and eate it vp and it shall make thy belly bytter but it shalbe in thy mouth as swete as hony .
66010010	and I toke the lytle boke out of his honde and ate it vp and it was in my mouth as swete as hony and as sone as I had eate it my belly was bytter .
66010011	And he sayde vnto me : thou muste prophesy agayne amonge the people and nacions and tonges and to many kynges .
66011001	And then was geven me a rede lyke vnto a rodd and it was sayd vnto me : Ryse and mete the temple of god and the aultre and them that worshippe therin
66011002	and the quyre which is within the temple cast oute and mete it not : for it is gevyn vnto the gentyles and the holy cite shall they treade vnderfote . xlii . monethes .
66011003	And I will geve power vnto my two wytnesses and they shall prophesy . M . iic . and . lx . dayes clothed in sacke cloth .
66011004	These are two olyve trees and two cadlestyckes stodinge before ye god of ye erth
66011005	And if eny man will hurt them fyre shall procede out of their mouthes and consume their ennemyes . And yf eny ma will hurt the this wyse muste he be kylled .
66011006	These have power to shut heven that it rayne not in the dayes of their prophesyinge : and have power over waters to turne them to bloud and to smyte the erth wt almaner plages as often as they will .
66011007	And when they have fynysshed their testimony the beste that cam oute of the bottomlesse pytt shall make warre agaynst them and shall overcome them and kyll them .
66011008	And their boddyes shall lye in the stretes of the greate cite which spritually is called zodom and Egypte where oure lorde was crucified .
66011009	And they of the people and kynredes and tonges and they of the nacions shall se their bodyes . iii . dayes and an halfe and shall not suffre their boddyes to be put in graves .
66011010	And they that dwell apon the erth shall reioyce over them and be glad and shall send gyftes one to another for these two prophetes vexed them yt dwelt on the erth .
66011011	And after . iii . dayes and an halffe the sprete of lyfe from god entred into the . And they stode vp apo their fete : and greate feare came apon the which sawe them .
66011012	And they herde a greate voyce from heven saying vnto the . Come vp hidder . And they ascended vp into heven in a cloude and their ennemyes sawe the .
66011013	And ye same houre was ther a gret erth quake and the tenthe parte of the cite fell and in the erth quake were slayne names of men seven . M . and the remnaunt were feared and gave glory to god of heven .
66011014	The seconde woo is past and beholde ye thyrd woo wyll come ano
66011015	And the seventh angell blewe and therwere made great voyces in heve sayinge : the kyngdoms of this worlde are oure lordes and his christes and he shall raygne for ever more .
66011016	And the . xxiiii . elders which sytt before god on their seates fell apon their faces and worshipped God
66011017	sayinge : we geve the thankes lorde God allmyghte : which arte and wast and arte to come for thou haste receaved thy great myght and hast raygned .
66011018	And the nacions were angry and thy wrath is come and the tyme of ye deed that they shuld be iudged and that thou shuldest geve rewarde vnto thy servauntes the prophettes and saynctes and to them that feare thy name small and great and shuldest destroye them which destroye ye erth .
66011019	And the temple of God was openyd in heve and there was sene in his teple the arcke of his testamet : and ther folowed lyghtnynges and voyces and thondrynges and erth quake and moche hayle .
66012001	And ther appered a gret wonder in heve A woman clothed with the sunne and the mone vnder her fete and apon her heed a croune of xii . starres .
66012002	And she was wt chylde and cryed travayllinge in byrth and payned redy to be delyvered .
66012003	And ther appered another wonder in heven for beholde a gret red drago havynge . vii . heddes and ten hornes and crounes vpo his heddes :
66012004	and his tayle drue the thyrde parte of the starres and cast them to the erth . And the dragon stode before the woman which was reddy to be delyvred : for to devoure her chylde as sone as it were borne .
66012005	And she brought forth a man chylde which shulde rule all nacions with a rode of yron And her sonne was taken vp vnto God and to his seate .
66012006	And the woman fleed into wyldernes where she had a place prepared of god that they shulde fede her there a M . ii . C and lx . dayes .
66012007	And ther was grett battayll in heven Michael and his angells fowght with the dragon and the dragon fowght and his angelles
66012008	and prevaylled not : nether was their place founde eny more in heven .
66012009	And the grett dragon that olde serpent called the devyll and Sathanas was cast out . Which desceaveth all the worlde . And he was cast into the erth and his angelles were cast out also .
66012010	And I harde a lowde voyce sayinge : in heve is nowe made salvacio and strengthe and ye kyngdome of oure God and the power of his Christ For he is cast doune which accused them before god daye and nyght .
66012011	And they overcame him by the bloude of the lambe and by the worde of their testimony and they loved not their lyves vnto the deeth .
66012012	Therfore reioyce hevens and ye that dwell in them . Woo to the inhabiters of the erth and of the see : for ye devyll is come doune vnto you which hath greet wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short tyme .
66012013	And when the dragon sawe that he was caste vnto the erth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man chylde .
66012014	And to the woman were geven two wynges of a great egle that she myght flye into the wyldrenes into her place where she is norysshed for a tyme tymes and halffe a tyme from the presence of the sarpent .
66012015	And the dragon cast out of his mouth water after the woman as it had bene a ryver because she hulde have bene caught of the floud .
66012016	And the erth holpe the woman and the erth opened her mouth and swalowed vp the rever which the dragon cast out of hys mouth .
66012017	And the dragon was wroth with the woman : and went and made warre with the remnaunt of hyr sede which kepe the commaundmentes of god and have the testimony of Iesus Christe . And I stode on the see sonde .
66013001	And I sawe a best rise out of the see havinge vii . heddes and x . hornes and apon hys hornes x . crownes and apon his heed the name of blasphemy .
66013002	And the beast which I sawe was lyke a catt of the mountayne and his fete were as the fete of a bear and his mouth as the mouthe of a lyon . And the dragon gave him his power and his seate and grett auctorite :
66013003	and I sawe one of his heedes as it were wouded to deth and his dedly woude was healed . And all the worlde wondred at the beast
66013004	and they worshipped ye drago which gave power vnto the beest and they worshipped the beest sayinge : who is lyke vnto the beast ? who is able to warre with him ?
66013005	And ther was a mouth geve vnto him that spake great thinges and blasphemies and power was geve vnto him to do xlii . Monethes
66013006	And he opened his mowth vnto blasphemy agaynst God to blaspheme hys name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heven .
66013007	And it was geven vnto him to make warre with the saynctes and to overcome them . And power was geven him over all kynred tonge and nacion :
66013008	and all that dwell apon the erth worshipt him : whose names are not written in the boke of lyfe of the lambe which was kylled from the begynnynge of the worlde .
66013009	Yf eny man have an eare lett him heare .
66013010	He that leadeth into captivite shall goo into captivite : he that kylleth with a swearde must be kylled with a swearde . Heare is the pacience and the fayth of the saynctes .
66013011	And I behelde another best commynge vp oute of the erth and he had two hornes like a lambe and he spake as dyd the dragon .
66013012	And he dyd all that the fyrste beest coulde do in his presence and he caused the erth and them which dwell therin to worshippe the fyrst beest whose dedly woude was healed .
66013013	And he dyd grett wonders so that he made fyre come doune from heven in the syght of men .
66013014	And deceaved them that dwelt on the erth by the meanes of those signes which he had power to doo in the sight of the beest sayinge to the that dwelt on the erth : that they shuld make an ymage vnto the beest which had the woude of a swearde and dyd lyve .
66013015	And he had power to geve a sprete vnto the ymage of the beest and that the ymage of the beest shuld speake and shuld cause that as many as wolde not worshyppe the ymage of the beest shuld be kylled .
66013016	And he made all bothe smale and grett ryche and poore fre and bond to receave a marke in their right hondes or in their forheddes .
66013017	And that no ma myght by or sell save he that had the marke or the name of the beest other the nombre of his name .
66013018	Here is wisdome . Let him that hath wytt count the nombre of the beest . For it is the nombre of a man and his nombre is sixe hondred threscore and sixe .
66014001	And I loked and loo a lambe stode on the mount Syon and with him C . and xliiii . thousande havynge his fathers name written in their forhedes .
66014002	And I herde a voyce from heven as the sounde of many waters and as the voyce of a gret thoundre And I herde the voyce of harpers harpynge with their harpes .
66014003	And they songe as it were a newe songe before the seate and before the foure beestes and the elders and no man coulde learne that songe but the hondred and xliiii . M . which were redemed from the erth .
66014004	These are they which were not defyled with wemen for they are virgyns . These folowe the lambe whither soever he goeth . These were redemed from men beynge the fyrste frutes vnto God and to the lambe
66014005	and in their mouthes was foude no gyle . For they are with oute spott before the trone of god .
66014006	And I sawe an angell flye in the myddes of heven havynge an everlastynge gospell to preache vnto them that sytt and dwell on the erth and to all nacions kinreddes and tonges and people
66014007	sayinge with a lowde voyce : Feare God and geve honour to him for the houre of his iudgement is come : and worshyppe him that made heven and erth and the see and fountaynes of water .
66014008	And there folowed another angell sayinge : Babilon is fallen is fallen that gret cite for she made all nacions drynke of the wyne of hyr fornicacion .
66014009	And the thyrde angell folowed them sayinge with aloude voyce : Yf eny man worshippe the beest and his ymage and receave hie marke in his forhed or on his honde
66014010	the same shall drynke of the wyne of the wrath of God which is powred in the cuppe of his wrath . And he shalbe punnysshed in fyre and brymstone before the holy Angels and before the lambe .
66014011	And the smoke of their turment ascendeth vp evermore . And they have no rest daye ner nyght which worshippe ye beast and his ymage and whosoever receaveth the prynt of his name .
66014012	Here is the pacience of saynctes . Heare are they that kepe the commaundmentes and the fayth of Iesu .
66014013	And I herde a voyce from heven sayinge vnto me : wryte . Blessed are the deed which here after dye in the lorde even soo sayth the sprete : that they maye rest fro their laboures but their workes shall folowe them .
66014014	And I loked and beholde a whyte clowde and apon the clowde one syttynge lyke vnto the sonne of man havynge on his heed a golde crowne and in his honde a sharpe sykle .
66014015	And another angell came oute of the temple cryinge with a lowde voyce to him that sate on the clowde . Thruste in thy sycle and repe : for the tyme is come to repe for the corne of the erth is rype .
66014016	And he that sate on the clowde thrust in his sykle on the erth and the erth was reped .
66014017	And another angell came oute of the temple which is in heven havynge also a sharpe sycle .
66014018	And another angell came oute from yt aultre which had power over fyre and cryed with a lowde crye to him that had the sharpe sykle and sayde : thrust in thy sharpe sykle and gaddre the clusters of the erth for her grapes are rype .
66014019	And the angell thrust in his sykle on the erth and cut doune the grapes of the vyneyarde of the erth : and cast them into the gret wynefat of the wrath of god
66014020	and the wynefat was trodden with out the cite and bloud came oute of the fat eve vnto the hors brydles by the space of a thowsande and . vi . C . furlonges .
66015001	And I sawe another signe in heve grett and mervellous . vii . angells havynge the seven laste plages for in the is fulfylled ye wrath of god .
66015002	And I sawe as it were a glassye see mingled with fyre and the that had gotten victory of the beest and of his ymage and of his marke and of the nombre of his name stode on the glassye see havinge ye harpes of god
66015003	and they songe the songe of Moses the servaunt of god and the songe of the lambe sayinge . Gret and marvellous are thy workes Lorde god almyghty iuste and true are thy wayes kynge of saynctes .
66015004	Who shall not feare o lorde and gloryfy thy name ? For thou only arte holy and all gentylls shall come and worshippe before the for thy iudgmentes are made manyfeste .
66015005	And after that I loked and beholde ye temple of the tabernacle of testimony was opyn in heven
66015006	and the seven angelles cam out of the temple which had the seven plages clothed in pure and bryght lynnen and havynge their brestes gyrded with golden gerdelles .
66015007	And one of the fowre beestes gave vnto ye seve angells vii . golden vialles full of ye wrath of God which lyveth for ever more .
66015008	And the temple was full of the smoke of the glory of God and of his power and no man was able to entre into the temple tyll the seven plages of the seven angels were fulfilled .
66016001	And I herde a great voyce out of ye temple sayinge to the seven angels : goo youre wayes poure out youre vialles of wrath apon the erth .
66016002	And the fyrst went and poured out his viall apo the erth and there fell anoysom and a sore botche apo the me which had the marke of the best and ap on the which worshipped his ymage .
66016003	And the seconde angell shed out his viall apon ye see and it turned as it were into the bloud of a deed ma : and every lyvinge thynge dyed in the see .
66016004	And ye thyrde angell shed out his vyall apon the ryvers and fountaynes of waters and they turned to bloud .
66016005	And I herde an angell saye : lorde which arte and wast thou arte ryghteous and holy because thou hast geve soche iudgmentes
66016006	for they shed out the bloude of sayntes and prophettes and therfore hast thou geven them bloud to drynke : for they are worthy .
66016007	And I herde another out of the aultre saye : even soo lorde god almyghty true and righteous are thy iudgementes .
66016008	And the fourth angell poured out his viall on the sunne and power was geve vnto him to vexe men with heate of fyre .
66016009	And the men raged in gret heate and spake evyll of the name of God which had power over those plages and they repented not to geve him glory .
66016010	And the fifte angell poured out his vyall apon the seate of the beste and his kyngdome wexed derke and they gnewe their tonges for sorowe
66016011	and blasphemed the god of heven for sorowe and payne of their sores and repented not of their dedes .
66016012	And the sixte angell poured out his vyall apon the gret ryver Euphrates and the water dryed vp that the wayes of the kyngss of the este shulde be prepared .
66016013	And I sawe thre vnclene sprettes lyke frogges come out of the mouthe of the dragon and out of the mouthe of the beeste and out of the mouthe of the falce prophett .
66016014	For they are the sprettes of devyls workynge myracles to go out vnto the kynges of the erth and of the whole worlde to gaddre them to the battayle of that gret daye of God allmyghty .
66016015	Beholde I come as a thefe . Happy is he that watcheth and kepeth his garmentes Lest he be founde naked and men se his filthynes .
66016016	And he gaddered them togedder into a place called in the hebrue tonge Armagedon .
66016017	And the seventhe angell poured out his viall in to the ayre . And there came a voyce out of heven from the seate sayinge : it is done .
66016018	And there folowed voyces thondringes and lightnynges and there was a grett erthquake soche as was not sence men were apon the erth so myghty an erthquake and so grett .
66016019	And the greate cite was devyded into thre parties And the cities of nacions fell . And grett Babilon came in remembraunce before God to geve vnto hyr the cuppe of wyne of the fearcenes of his wrathe .
66016020	Every yle fled awaye and the mountaynes were not founde .
66016021	And ther fell a gret hayle as it had bene talentes out of heven apon the men and the men blasphemed God be cause of the plage of the hayle for it was grett and the plage of it sore .
66017001	And there cam one of the seven angels which had the seven vialles and talked with me sayinge vnto me : come I will shewe the the iudgment of the grett whore that sytteth apon many waters
66017002	with whome have commytted fornicacion the kynges of the erth so that the inhabiters of the erth are droken with the wyne of her fornicacion .
66017003	And he caryed me a waye into the wildernes in the sprete . And I sawe a woman sytt apon a rose colored best full of names of blaphemie which had ten hornes .
66017004	And the woman was arayed in purple and rose color and decked with golde precious stone and pearles and had a cup of golde in her honde full of a hominacions and fylthynes of her fornycacion .
66017005	And in her forhed was a name wrytten a mistery gret Babylon the mother of whordome and abominacions of the erth .
66017006	And I sawe the wyfe dronke with the bloud of saynctes and with the bloud of the witnesses of Iesu . And when I sawe her I wondred with grett mervayle .
66017007	And the angell sayde vnto me : wherfore mervayllyst thou ? I wyll shewe the ye mistery of the woman and of the best that berith her which hath seven heddes and ten hornes .
66017008	The best that thou seest was and is not and shall ascende out of the bottomlesse pytt and shall goo into perdicion and they that dwell on the erth shall wondre ( whose names are not wrytten in the boke of lyfe from ye begynnynge of the worlde ) when they beholde the best that was and ys nott .
66017009	And here ys a mynde that hath wisdome . The seven heddes are seven mountaynes on which the woman sytteth :
66017010	they are also seven kynges . Fyve are fallen and on ys and onother is not yet come . Whe he cometh he muste contynew a space .
66017011	And the beste that was and ys not is even the ayght and ys one of the seven and shall goo into destruccion .
66017012	And the ten hornes which thou seist are ten kynges which have receaved no kyngdome but shall receave power as kynges at one houre with the beest .
66017013	These have one mynde and shall geve their power and strenghte vnto ye beste .
66017014	These shall fyght with the lambe and the lambe shall overcome them : For he is lorde of lordes and kynge of kynges : and they that are on hys syde are called and chosen and faythfull .
66017015	And he sayde vnto me : the waters which thou sawest where the whore syttith are people and folke and nacions and tonges .
66017016	And the ten hornes which thou sawest apon the best are they that shall hate the whore and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eate their flesshe and burne her with fyre .
66017017	For God hathe put in their hertes to fulfyll hys wyll and to do with one consent for to geve hir kyngdom vnto the beast vntill the wordes of God be fulfylled .
66017018	And the woman which thou sawest ys that gret cyte which raigneth over the kynges of the erth .
66018001	And after that I sawe another angell come from heven havinge gret power and the erth was lyghtned with hys bryghtnes .
66018002	And he cryed myghtyly with a stronge voyce sayinge : Great Babilon is fallen ys fallen and ys become the habitation of devels and the holde of all fowle sprettes and a cage of all vnclene and hatefull byrdes
66018003	for all nacions have dronken of the wyne of the wrath of her fornycacion . And the kynges of the erth have committed fornicacion with her and her marchauntes are wexed ryche of the abundance of her pleasures .
66018004	And I herde another voyce from heven saye : come a waye from her my people that ye be not parttakers in her synnes that ye receave not of her plages .
66018005	For her synnes are gon vp to heven and God hath remembred her wyckednes .
66018006	Rewarde her even as she rewarded you and geve her dubble accordynge to her workes . And poure in dubble to her in the same cuppe which she fylled vnto you .
66018007	And as moche as she gloryfied her silfe and lyved wantanly so moche poure ye in for her of punysshment and sorowe for she sayde in her herte : I sytt beinge a quene and am no wyddowe and shall se no sorowe .
66018008	Therfore shall her plages come at one daye deeth and sorowe and honger and she shallbe brent with fyre : for stronge ys the lorde god which iudgeth her .
66018009	And the kynges of the erth shalbe wepe her and wayle over her which have committed fornicacion with her and have lyved wantanly with her when they shall se the smoke of her burnynge
66018010	and shall stonde a farre of for feare of her punnysshment sayinge : Alas Alas that gret cite Babilon that myghty cite : For at won houre is her iudgment come .
66018011	And the marchauntes of the erth shall wepe and wayle in them selves for no man wyll bye their ware eny more
66018012	the ware of golde and silver and precious stones nether of pearle and raynes and purple and skarlet and all thyne wodde and almanner vessels of yvery and almanner vessels of most precious wodde and of brasse and of yron
66018013	and synamon and odours and oyntmentes and frankynsence and wyne and oyle and fyne floure and wheate bestes and shepe and horsys and charrettes and boddyes and soules of men .
66018014	And the apples that thy soule lusted after are departed fro the . And all thynges which were deyntie and had in pryce ar departed fro the and thou shalt fynde them no more .
66018015	The marchauntes of these thynges which were wexed ryche shall stonde a farre of from her for feare of the punyshment of her wepynge and waylynge
66018016	and saying : alas alas that grett cite that was clothed in raynes and purple and scarlett and decked with golde and precious stone and pearles :
66018017	for at one houre so great ryches ys come to nought And every shippe governer and all they that occupied shippes and shippmen which worke in the see stode a farre of
66018018	and cryed when they sawe the smoke of her burnynge sayinge what cite is lyke vnto this grett cite ?
66018019	And they cast dust on their heddes and cryed wepynge and waylinge and sayed : Alas Alas yt greate cite wherin were made ryche all that had shyppes in the see by the reason of her costlynes for atone houre is she made desolate
66018020	Reioyce over her thou heven and ye holy Apostles and prophetes : for god hath geven youre iudgment on her .
66018021	And a myghty angell toke vp a stone lyke a grett mylstone and cast it into the see sayinge : with suche violence shall that gret cite Babilon be cast and shallbe founde no more .
66018022	And the voyce of harpers and musicions and of pypers and trompetters shalbe herde no more in the : and no craftes man of whatsoever craft he be shalbe founde eny more in the . and the soude of a myll shalbe herde no more in the
66018023	and the voyce of the brydegrome and of the bryde shalbe herde no more in the : for thy marchauntes were ye grett men of ye erth . And with thyne inchantment were deceaved all nacions :
66018024	and in her was founde the bloude of the prophettes and of ye saynctes and of all that were slayne apon ye erth .
66019001	And after yt I herde ye voyce of moche people in heven sayinge : Alleluia . Saluacion and glory and honour and power be ascribed to ye lorde oure god
66019002	for true and ryghteous are his iudgmentes for he hath iudged ye grett whore which did corrupt the erth with her fornicacion and hath avenged the bloud of his servauntes of her hond .
66019003	And agayne they said : Alleluya . And smoke rose vp for evermore .
66019004	And the xxiiii . elders and the iiii . bestes fell doune and worshypped god that sate on the seate sayinge : Amen Alleluya .
66019005	And a voyce cam out of the seate saying : prayse oure lorde god all ye that are his servauntes and ye that feare him both small and grett .
66019006	And I herde the voyce of moche people eve as the voyce of many waters and as the voyce of stronge thondrynges sayinge : Alleluya for god omnipotent raigneth .
66019007	Let vs be glad and reioyce and geve honour to him : for the mariage of the lambe is come and hys wyffe made her sylfe reddy .
66019008	And to her was graunted that she shulde be arayed with pure and goodly raynes . For the raynes is the ryghtewesnes of saynctes .
66019009	And he sayde vnto me : happy are they which are called vnto the Labes supper . And he sayde vnto me : these are the true sayinges of God .
66019010	And I fell at his fete to worshyppe him . And he sayde vnto me se thou do it not . For I am thy felowe seruaunt and one of thy brethern and of them that have the testimony of Iesus . Worshyppe God . For the testymony of Iesus ys the sprete of prophesy .
66019011	And I sawe heven open and beholde a whyte horsse : and he that sat apon him was faythfull and true and in ryghtewesnes dyd iudge and make battayle .
66019012	His eyes were as a flame of fyre : and on his heed were many crounes : and he had a name written yt noman knewe but him sylfe .
66019013	And he was clothed with a vesture dipt in bloud and and hys name ys called the worde of God .
66019014	And the warriers which were in heven folowed him apon whyte horsses clothed with whyte and pure raynes :
66019015	and out of his mouthe went out a sharppe swerde that with yt he shuld smyte the hethen . And he shall rule them with a rodde of yron and he trode the wynefatt of fearsnes and wrath of almyghty god .
66019016	And hath on his vesture and on his thygh a name written : kynge of kynges and lorde of lordes .
66019017	And I sawe an angell stonde in the sunne and he cryed with a lowde voyce sayinge to all the fowles that flye by ye myddes of heve come and gaddre youre selves to gedder vnto the supper of the gret god
66019018	that ye maye eate the flesshe of kynges and of hye captaynes and the flesshe of myghty men and the flesshe of horsses and of them that sytt on them and the flesshe of all free men and bond men and of small and gret .
66019019	And I sawe the beste and the kynges of the erth and their warriers gaddred to gedder to make battayle agaynste him that satt on the horsse and agaynst his sowdiers .
66019020	And the beste was take and with him that falce prophett that wrought myracles before him with which he desceaved the that receaved ye beestes marke and them that worshipped his ymage . These both were cast into a pode of fyre burnyge with brymstone :
66019021	and ye remnaunte were slayne with ye swearde of him that sat apon the horsse which swearde proceded out of his mouthe and all the foules were fulfilled with their flesshe .
66020001	And I sawe an angell come doune from heven havinge the kaye of the bottomlesse pyt and a gret chayne in his honde .
66020002	And he toke the drago that olde serpet which is the devyll and Satanas and he bounde him a thousand yeares :
66020003	and cast him into the bottomlesse pit and he bounde him and set a seale on him yt he shuld desceaue the people no moare tyll the . M . yeares were fulfilled . And after yt he muste be loosed for a litell season .
66020004	And I sawe seattes and they sat apon them and iudgement was geven vnto them : and I sawe the soules of them that were behedded for the witnes of Iesu and for the worde of God : which had not worshypped the best nether his ymage nether had taken his marke vpon their forheddes or on their hondes : and they lyved and raygned with Christ a . M . yere :
66020005	but the wother of the deed men lyved not agayne vntyll the . M . yere were fynisshed . This is that fyrst resurreccion .
66020006	Blessed and holy is he that hath parte in the fyrst resurreccion . For on suche shall the seconde deeth have no power for they shalbe the prestes of God and of Christ and shall raygne with him a . M . yere .
66020007	And when the . M . yeares are experied Satan shalbe lowsed out of his preson
66020008	and shall goo oute to deceave the people which are in the foure quarters of the erth Gog and Magog to gadder them to gedder to batayle whose nombre is as the sonde of the see :
66020009	and they went vp on the playne of the erth and compased the tentes of the saynctes about and the beloved cite . And fyre cam doune from God out of heven and devoured them :
66020010	and the devyll that desceaved them was cast into a lake of fyre and brymstone where the beest and the falce prophet were and shalbe tormented daye and nyght for ever more .
66020011	And I sawe a grett whyte seate and him that sate on it from whose face fleed awaye both the erth and heave and their place was no more founde .
66020012	And I sawe the deed both grett and small stonde before God : And the bokes were opened and another boke was opened which is the boke of lyfe and the deed were iudged of thoo thynges which weer wrytten in the bokes accordinge to their dedes :
66020013	and the see gave vp her deed which were in her and deth and hell delyvered vp the deed which were in them : and they were iudged every man accordinge to his dedes .
66020014	And deth and hell were cast into the lake of fyre . This is that second deeth .
66020015	And whosoever was not founde written in the boke of lyfe was cast into the lake of fyre .
66021001	And I sawe a newe heven and a newe erth For the fyrst heven and the fyrst erth were vanysshed awaye and there was no more see .
66021002	And I Iho sawe that holy cite newe Ierusalem come doune from God oute of heven prepared as a bryde garnysshed for hyr husband .
66021003	And I herde a grett voyce out of heaven sayinge : beholde the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with the And they shalbe his people and God him sylffe shalbe with the and be their god .
66021004	And God shall wype awaye all teares fro their eyes . And there shalbe nomore deeth nether sorowe nether cryinge nether shall there be eny more payne for the olde thynges are gone .
66021005	And he that sate apon the seate sayde : Behold I make all thynges newe . And he sayde vnto me : wryte for these wordes are faythfull and true .
66021006	And he sayde vnto me : it is done I am Alpha and Omega the begynnynge and the ende . I will geve to him yt is a thyrst of the well of the water of lyfe fre .
66021007	He that overcometh shall inheret all thynges and I will be his God and he shalbe my sonne .
66021008	But the fearefull and vnbelevynge and the abhominable and murdrers and whormongers and sorcerers and ydolaters and all lyars shall have their parte in the lake which burnyth with fyre and brymstone which is the seconde deth .
66021009	And there cam vnto me one of the vii . angels which had the vii . vyals full of the vii . laste plages : and talked with me sayinge : come hydder I will shewe the the bryde the lambes wyfe .
66021010	And he caryed me awaye in the sprete to a grett and an hye mountayne and he shewed me the grett cite holy Ierusalem descendinge out of heven fro God
66021011	havynge the brightnes of God . And her shynynge was lyke vnto a stone moste precious even a Iaspar cleare as cristall :
66021012	and had walles grett and hye and had xii gates and at the gates xii . angels : and names written which are the xii . trybes of Israell :
66021013	on the est parte iii gatis and on the north syde iii gates and to wardes the south iii gates and from the west iii gates :
66021014	and the wall of the cite had xii foundacions and in them the names of the lambes . xii . Apostles .
66021015	And he that talked with me had a golden read to measure the cite with all and the gates therof and the wall therof .
66021016	And the cite was bylt iiii . square and the length was as large as the bredth of it and he measured the cite with the rede . xii M . fur longes : and the lenght and the bredth and ye heyth of it were equall .
66021017	And he measured the wall therof . an cxliiii . cubittes : the measure that ye angell had was after the measure that man vseth .
66021018	And the byldinge of the wall of it was of iaspar . And the cite was pure gold lyke vnto cleare glasse
66021019	and the foundacions of the wall of ye cite was garnisshed with all maner of precious stones The fyrste foundacion was iaspar the seconde saphyre the thyrde a calcedony the fourth an emeralde :
66021020	the fyft sardonix : the sixt sardeos : the seventh crysolite the ayght berall : the nynth a topas : the tenth a crysoprasos : the eleventh a iacyncte : the twelfe an amatist .
66021021	The xii . gates were xii pearles every gate was of one pearle and the strete of the cite was pure golde as thorowe shynynge glasse .
66021022	And there was no temple therin . For the lord god allmyghty and the lambe are the temple of it
66021023	and the cite hath no nede of the sonne nether of the mone to lyghten it . For the bryghtnes of God dyd light it : and the lambe was the light of it .
66021024	And the people which are saved shall walke in the light of it : and the kynges of the erth shall brynge their glory vnto it .
66021025	And ye gates of it are not shut by daye . For there shalbe no nyght there .
66021026	And there shall entre into it none vnclene thynge : nether what soever worketh abhominacion : or maketh lyes : but they only which are wrytten in the lambes boke of lyfe .
66021027	And there shall entre into it none vnclene thynge : nether what soever worketh abhominacion : or maketh lyes : but they only which are wrytten in the lambes boke of lyfe .
66022001	And he shewed me a pure ryver of water of lyfe clere as cristall : procedynge oute of the seate of God and of the lambe .
66022002	In the myddes of the strete of it and of ether syde of ye ryver was there wode of lyfe : which bare xii maner of frutes : and gave frute every moneth : and the leves of the wodde served to heale the people with all .
66022003	And there shalbe no more cursse but the seate of god and the lambe shalbe in it : and his servauntes shall serve him :
66022004	And shall se his face and his name shalbe in their forheddes .
66022005	And there shall be no nyght there and they nede no candle nether light of the sunne : for the lorde God geveth them light and they shall raygne for evermore .
66022006	And he sayde vnto me : these sayinges are faythfull and true . And the lorde god of saynctes and prophetes sent his angell to shewe vnto his servauntes the thynges which muste shortly be fulfylled .
66022007	Beholde I come shortly . Happy is he that kepeth the sayinge of ye prophesy of this boke .
66022008	I am Ihon which sawe these thynges and herde them . And when I had herde and sene I fell doune to worshippe before the fete of the angell which shewed me these thynges .
66022009	And he sayd vnto me : se thou do it not for I am thy feloweservaunt and the feloweservaunt of thy brethren the prophettes and of them which kepe the sayinges of this boke . But worshippe God .
66022010	And he sayde vnto me : seale not the sayinges of prophesy of this boke . For the tyme is at honde .
66022011	He that doeth evyl let him do evyl still : and he which is fylthy let him be fylthy still : and he that is righteous let him be more righteous : and he that is holy let him be more holy .
66022012	And beholde I come shortly and my rewarde with me to geve every man accordinge as his dedes shalbe .
66022013	I am Alpha and Omega the begynninge and the ende : the fyrst and the last .
66022014	Blessed are they that do hys commaundmentes that their power maye be in the tree of lyfe and maye entre in thorow the gates into the cite .
66022015	For without shalbe dogges and inchauters and whormongers and mortherers and ydolaters and whosoever loveth or makith lesynges .
66022016	I Iesus sent myne angell to testyfye vnto you these thynges in the congregacions . I am the rote and the generacion of David and the bright mornynge starre .
66022017	And the sprete and the bryde sayde come . And let him that heareth saye also come . And let him that is athyrst come . And let whosoever wyll take of the water of lyfe fre .
66022018	I testifye vnto every man that heareth the wordes of prophesy of thys boke . yf eny man shall adde vnto these thynges god shall adde vnto him the plages that are wrytten in this boke .
66022019	And yf eny man shall mynyshe of the wordes of ye boke of this prophesy god shall take a waye his parte out of the boke of lyfe and oute of ye holy citie and fro thoo thynge which are written in this boke .
66022020	He which testifyeth these thinges sayth : be it I come quyckly Amen . Even soo : come lorde Iesu .
66022021	The grace of oure lorde Iesu Christ be with you all . Amen .
